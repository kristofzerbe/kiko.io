The only thing I needed was a toggle element and a little bit of JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Of course, I couldn’t manipulate the <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#descdef-media-prefers-color-scheme\">media query <code>prefers-color-scheme</code></a> itself, but introduce a different way by blog uses it.
