The crippeled UI is not the most modern and I was more than once annoyed about its usability.</p>\n<p>Doing a research for a good alternative, you stumble always over the usual suspects: MediaMonkey, Foobar2000, Winamp, VLC or even Media Player Classic!? Not modern enough, not user friendly enough, not lean enough.</p>\n<p>I really don’t remember where, but there was a screenshot of a player, which seems to be the complete opposite of the others: <strong>Dopamine</strong> from <a href=\"https://www.digimezzo.com/software/\">Digimezzo</a>, a project by the Belgian developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaphaelGodart\">Raphaël Godart</a>…</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Dopamine-How-Software-should-be/screenshot_dopamine_202.png\" alt=\"Screenshot Dopamine 2.0.2.\"></p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clnhknzcz003uonot93wb25bz"}],"tags":[{"name":"Windows","_id":"clnhknzdq006aonota6le121y"},{"name":"Audio","_id":"clnhknzdr006conot6vfw4bdx"}],"_path":"post/Dopamine-How-Software-should-be/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Dopamine-How-Software-should-be/","_id":"clnhknzah000qonot522r41r0"},{"title":"Dopamine, a music player for Windows 10 as it should be","date":"2022-08-21T10:00:00.000Z","description":"<p>There are about fourleventy millions music apps for smartphones running Android and iOS. However, most of them are relatively junk or try to foist malware on users. You have to make sure that you separate the wheat from the chaff. On the other hand, the situation is surprisingly different for Windows, the much older operating system. The older ones of us will still remember the glorious WinAmp times, whose current owner Radionomy has been making a very long new attempt for a new version 6 since 2018 (version 5.8 is already a handsome 6 years old), but you can actually count the good music players for Windows 10 and higher on one hand, if you subtract the streaming apps such as Spotify and Co. and disregard everything that comes along as a jack of all trades and can ALSO play MP3. The best known are the in Windows included and miserably failed iTunes clone from Micosoft called <strong>Groove</strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.aimp.ru/\">AIMP</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.foobar2000.org/\">foobar2000</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.mediamonkey.com/\">MediaMonkey</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.getmusicbee.com/\">MusicBee</a></strong>. Some nostalgic people might also add the good old <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287\">Windows Media Player</a>, which managed to survive on the net despite Groove. If you look at the download pages of these music player candidates and try to look behind the business model, some of them simply do not download. One or the other player also overdoes it with the featuritis. Bouncing balls or bars to the music are gimmicks that were thought to be outdated long ago, when it is actually only about listening to music.</p>\n<p>Belgian software developer <strong>Raphaël Godart</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaphaelGodart\">twitter.com&#x2F;RaphaelGodart</a>) must have felt the same way a few years ago when he set out to launch his own player for local MP3 collections, which in this case sounds falsely commercial because his player <strong><a href=\"http://www.digimezzo.com/software/\">Dopamine</a></strong> is freely available on GitHub and open source under GPL 3.0 license. It plays music under a plain and simple, yet chic interface … Period.

One strength of the old medium is that it presents us with music we haven’t heard before, away from our playlists on Spotify or iTunes.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to rediscover new artists or entire genres of music is to pick a radio station at random. It’s precisely this lack of control, the being at the mercy, the sometimes unpredictable that makes the medium so appealing to many - and with digital streaming, many of the world’s stations are just a tap away.</p>\n<p>As is so often the case in the modern world, it’s the oversupply that leaves some confused and frustrated. You first have to be able to pick out what you might like from the gigantic haystack of options. For this purpose, there are little helpers that more or less independently suggest what you might listen to. One of them stands out from the crowd because, on the one hand, it does not pursue commercial interests and, on the other hand, it approaches the station search very intuitively: <strong><a href=\"https://radio.garden/\">Radio Garden (https://radio.garden)</a></strong>.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clnhknzcz003uonot93wb25bz"}],"tags":[{"name":"Audio","_id":"clnhknzdr006conot6vfw4bdx"}],"_path":"post/Radio-Garden/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Radio-Garden/","_id":"clnhknzbt003fonotheud25n8"}]}
