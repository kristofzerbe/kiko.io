I got myself a <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a> account, after many years of staying away from social media as far as I could and at most tweeting a new blog post. Since my active Twitter days, things have taken such a turn for the worse, that I’ve preferred to stay away completely.</p>\n<p>I don’t know what made me join Mastodon on Sunday, but it sparked something in me: The love for the good old internet of the late 90s, early 2000s. These guys gave me a warm welcome and made me feel that Internet communities, away from sleazy influencers and banner ads, could actually still work. I got a taste of it, when I let this blog become part of IndieWeb over a year ago, but didn’t quite believe in it because of the low traffic and mentions.</p>\n<p>Now the richest man on the planet has to come along and buy the bird site, and a niche product called Mastodon, well known but underestimated in tech circles, almost explodes under the onslaught of disappointed commercial users. And that’s what we are on Twitter, Facebook and Co … a commercial object.</p>\n<p>The problem now will be how the community can integrate these many users for whom it was not mentally prepared. What now adapts to whom? The most important thing, however, will be to teach the newcomers (and I count myself among them) that Mastodon is not Twitter in new clothes!</p>\n<p>I was going to write a few things about this, but this morning I read a Twitter thread from <a href=\"https://mastodon.green/@pjakobs\"><strong>Peter Jakobs</strong></a>, a self-proclaimed digital Aboriginal from Germany, that just sums it all up and explains it so well I could hardly do it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pjakobs/status/1590276045521195008\"><img src=\"/post/Mastodon-simply-explained/tweet-peter-jakobs-22-11-09.png\" alt=\"Tweet from Peter Jakobs, November 29, 2022\"></a></p>\n<p>That’s why I’m now doing something I’ve never done before: I quote Peter here completely, translated from German into English … Curtain up (and thank you <a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/en/translator\">DeepL</a> :D):</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clocta6vj003xn4oj0ksl5v2p"}],"tags":[{"name":"Publishing","_id":"clocta6ws006nn4oj7d0469en"},{"name":"Social Media","_id":"clocta6zk00cxn4ojfndw9mwp"},{"name":"Mastodon","_id":"clocta6zl00czn4oj2s724dr5"}],"_path":"post/Mastodon-simply-explained/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Mastodon-simply-explained/","_id":"clocta6tg002nn4oj1bcx3y1z"},{"title":"Syndicate Mastodon Hashtags in your favorite Feed Reader","date":"2022-11-13T16:48:40.000Z","description":"<p>Ok, I admit it: I read RSS feeds. Quite old school you might think, but I’m mostly off Social Media and the most news sites quite a while ago, with a few exceptions. I just want to read selective stuff, especially in the direction of technology, and not interrupted by items, the news provider think I have to read. My favorite tool for my feed collection is <a href=\"https://feedly.com/\">Feedly</a>, which I open up almost every morning.</p>\n<p>Today, Max Böck gave me the momentum with his article <a href=\"https://mxb.dev/blog/the-indieweb-for-everyone/\">The IndieWeb for Everyone</a> to try another type of social media I know for quite a long time, but never give it a chance: <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(Software)\">Mastodon</a>.

Thoughts, experiences, self-dramatizations or even texts or posts from other people. This is especially true for microblogging on (formerly) Twitter and (today) Mastodon. To make this easy, the platforms often offer a SHARE endpoint (URL), such as the famous</p>\n<p><code>http://www.twitter.com/share?text=My impossible thoughts on X</code></p>\n<p>… or any dirt buttons to collect user data.</p>\n<p>A few months after the groundbreaking of Mastodon 2016, such a feature was also <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/442\">discussed and implemented</a> on GitHub and out came: </p>\n<p><code>https://&lt;your-instance&gt;/share&amp;text=My benevolent thoughts on the Fediverse</code></p>\n<p>But … where Twitter had it easy due to its central structure (twitter.com … period.), we Mastodon users all fidget around on <strong>different instances</strong>, i.e. each instance has its own <code>/SHARE</code> endpoint and so it’s a bit harder to stick a share button on your own blog, because you have to ask the user where he lives.</p>\n<p>Of course, online services like <a href=\"https://toot.kytta.dev/\">toot.kytta.dev</a>, <a href=\"https://s2f.kytta.dev/\">s2f.kytta.dev</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodonshare.com/\">mastodonshare.com</a> sprouted immediately, but also the button providers expanded their portfolio or new ones were launched, like <a href=\"https://shareon.js.org/\">shareon.js.org</a>, <a href=\"https://share-on-mastodon.social/\">share-on-mastodon.social</a>, <a href=\"https://www.shareaholic.com/website-tools/social-share-buttons/mastodon/\">shareaholic.com</a>.</p>\n<p>But seriously … does it take an external service to ask the user for an instance name and redirect him to an URL (and run the risk of falling victim to data collection mania)? Because that’s all it is. All of the above do it exactly that way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Mastodon-Share-Bottom-Sheet-Dialog/indieweb-social-share.png\" alt=\"indieweb.social Share\"></p>\n<p>So we come to the ready-made developer solutions e.g. How-To tutorials.
