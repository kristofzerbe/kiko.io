In this small town, where practically everybody knows everybody, there is a small football club called SV Wehen since 1926 and some of my schoolmates played there in their youth.</p>\n<p>This small club played only a regional role at all until 1979, when a local business man put money into the club and it worked its way up one league after the other over the years:</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"clmdaceia009cl2p3fjjx95se"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"clmdacejh00dll2p3gkph8um4"}],"_path":"post/My-Hometown-My-Club/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/My-Hometown-My-Club/","_id":"clmdacefi0037l2p364p64brr"},{"title":"SVWW vs. Karlsruhe @ 2023-08-18","date":"2023-08-19T16:33:00.000Z","description":"<p>I already had my season ticket on the first matchday of the 2023&#x2F;2024 season, but was unable to get into the stadium for the team’s first home game and thus missed the 1:1 draw against <strong>Magdeburg</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"First-Impressions\"><a href=\"#First-Impressions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"First Impressions\"></a>First Impressions</h2><p>So, Friday was my premiere on my season seat West 3, Row 1, Seat 1. That this seat was free when I booked it was a coincidence, but being so close to the pitch appealed to me.

We got six additional tickets for the game in time and with a crowd of 11,003 fans, this was also urgently necessary. The stadium (12,566 standing and seated) was full to the roof. Only one of three blocks of the guests was empty. Some Schalke fans seem to have expected nothing from the game in Wiesbaden. No wonder after table position 15 after the last match day.</p>\n<p>Since season ticket holders get into the stadium a little faster and my friends sat a little scattered in different blocks, I lost sight of them at some point, but that was not tragic, because they had fun.</p>\n<p>To my delight, the booth operators, who I had to criticize last time, actually did a better job today. Two cash registers: one for cash and another for card&#x2F;smartphone&#x2F;watch payers. The sale of beer and bratwurst went much more quickly, only I had to stand in line a bit at the fan shop, because I was not yet recognizable as a fan: it had to get a cap and a jersey, of course, finally.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"clmdaceia009cl2p3fjjx95se"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"clmdacejh00dll2p3gkph8um4"},{"name":"2.
