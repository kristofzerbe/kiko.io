Works also everything quite well … only the verification of the generated data was a bit cumbersome:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open DevTools for a page in Chrome.</li>\n<li>Search in the HEAD of the source code for the included script (“application&#x2F;ld+json”)</li>\n<li>Copy out JSON-LD code</li>\n<li>Format JSON into VS code … and check</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nothing for now and simply impossible on the smartphone, even if there would be a reasonable Chrome extension for displaying JSON-LD data, but it does not exist (yet). Another problem was that I use automatically generated Socal Media images for my articles, which are included in the JSON-LD, but do not appear anywhere in the page and thus were beyond my control. I simply wanted to display all the generated stuff.</p>\n<p>Since I’ve been a fan of the so-called bottom sheets since the first version of Google’s Material Design, I imagined a script that grabs the code embedded in the page and pushes a panel with all the data visualized there into the page from the bottom … and the whole act was easier than I thought.</p>","categories":[{"name":"UI/UX","_id":"clkdyvjsr0042igov4q0qg113"}],"tags":[{"name":"Publishing","_id":"clkdyvjte005sigov1law0w88"},{"name":"JSON-LD","_id":"clkdyvjvb00cqigovc4pkgovb"},{"name":"Meta","_id":"clkdyvjvc00d0igov1gx0eexy"}],"_path":"post/Show-pages-meta-data-JSON-LD-in-Bottom-Sheet/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Show-pages-meta-data-JSON-LD-in-Bottom-Sheet/","_id":"clkdyvjsz004jigove4npgwln"}]}
