The company from Redmond has done quite a lot right with the tool and has gathered a large group of open source developers around it (currently 1,640 contributors), who contribute to the fact that the Swiss Microsoft team around Erich Gamma can bring out a new release for Windows, Linux and macOS every few weeks.</p>\n<p>It all started with the <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/\">Monaco Editor</a>, the core around which VS Code is built and which was first released on April 14, 2016. The exciting thing about Monaco and VS Code is, that it is consistently written using web technologies, i.e. HTML, CSS and Javascript, packaged and executed using the framework <a href=\"https://www.electronjs.org/\">Electron</a> developed by GitHub, which in turn is based on <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a> and the open source browser engine <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/Home/\">Chromium</a> from Google.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clmg73g79003llvoo6i8c98uv"}],"tags":[{"name":"VS Code","_id":"clmg73g7c003qlvoo7pwjhqrq"},{"name":"GitHub","_id":"clmg73g7d003ulvoo049bhii5"},{"name":"Remote","_id":"clmg73gag00cclvoobn387obn"}],"_path":"post/Gitpod-Visual-Studio-Code-on-the-Web/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Gitpod-Visual-Studio-Code-on-the-Web/","_id":"clmg73g5n002llvoo94eihwac"},{"title":"One mouse to rule them all","date":"2022-10-08T09:46:57.000Z","description":"<p><strong>Multiple monitors on one computer are elementary for effective IT work. However, operating multiple computers with one input set requires tools, for example one from the Microsoft Garage.</strong></p>\n<p>The trend is toward second or third devices, especially among IT workers. In addition to the stationary computer, which may still be under the desk, there is a laptop and possibly a tablet. All of them are connected to cloud services. If the desk is large enough, there may be two monitors and a full-size keyboard connected to the desktop, the laptop on the left, on which two or three special programs are installed, and the Surface tablet on the right for communication with its narrow-track keyboard. And spread out on the table are three mice in different colors so as not to constantly get the wrong one. A scenario that the author of these lines was also confronted with … yes, until a few years ago a small tool for Microsoft Windows fell in front of his feet, which abruptly ended the input chaos: Mouse Without Borders.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clmg73g79003llvoo6i8c98uv"}],"tags":[{"name":"Windows","_id":"clmg73g880061lvoofgzx4llt"},{"name":"Workflow","_id":"clmg73g9v00anlvoo285s3iqr"},{"name":"Remote","_id":"clmg73gag00cclvoobn387obn"}],"_path":"post/One-mouse-to-rule-them-all/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/One-mouse-to-rule-them-all/","_id":"clmg73g5p002olvoo69x3eu5w"}]}
