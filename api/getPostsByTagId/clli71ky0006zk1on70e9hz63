But what makes Facebook, Twitter and others “social” is the interaction between the people. Likes, Retweets, Mentions, Replies are the fuel which drives them. But most of the blogging solutions offers only rudimentary interactions, in form of article comments. The comment hurdle is high because interacting on someone else’s site is different from interacting on what is supposed to be your own, such as your Twitter or Facebook feed.</p>\n<p>The project <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\"><strong>IndieWeb</strong></a> and their approach of <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Webmention\"><strong>Webmentions</strong></a>, has the goal to fill this gap.
