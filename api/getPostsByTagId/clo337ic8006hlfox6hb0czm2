And I mean <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/de/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html\">Lightroom Classic</a> and not the new web&#x2F;smartphone based software, which doesn’t come even close to the desktop application yet.</p>\n<p>I use Lightroom for all purposes after I shot my images: editing, cataloguing, managing and … publishing. On publishing Lightroom offers you two approaches: <em>Export</em> and <em>Publish</em>. While <em>Export</em> is mainly for creating JPG copies of edited RAW images, <em>Publish</em> goes one step further and gives you the ability to do “something” with your exported JPG’s, for example upload them on Flickr, Instagram, 500px or to your own web server via FTP. Major difference to <em>Export</em> is, that <em>Publish</em> keeps your images in sync. Everytime you change the source images, the defined publish services recognizes and offer you to re-publish your image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/lr-re-publish.png\" alt=\"Lightroom Publish\"></p>\n<p>In the past years I tried a lot of Lightroom plugins for publishing on several platforms, but it doesn’t work out for long, because all these platforms change their API almost every year (or are stamped) and the sparely maintained 3rd party plugins break.</p>\n<p>My workflow for quite some time is to publish my photos on the hard drive, in a folder, which is synced via Dropbox with the cloud.

But what makes Facebook, Twitter and others “social” is the interaction between the people. Likes, Retweets, Mentions, Replies are the fuel which drives them. But most of the blogging solutions offers only rudimentary interactions, in form of article comments.

Since my active Twitter days, things have taken such a turn for the worse, that I’ve preferred to stay away completely.</p>\n<p>I don’t know what made me join Mastodon on Sunday, but it sparked something in me: The love for the good old internet of the late 90s, early 2000s. These guys gave me a warm welcome and made me feel that Internet communities, away from sleazy influencers and banner ads, could actually still work. I got a taste of it, when I let this blog become part of IndieWeb over a year ago, but didn’t quite believe in it because of the low traffic and mentions.</p>\n<p>Now the richest man on the planet has to come along and buy the bird site, and a niche product called Mastodon, well known but underestimated in tech circles, almost explodes under the onslaught of disappointed commercial users.
