This sometimes works, but most of the time it doesn’t, because website owners often don’t pay attention to reasonable <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n<p>Because it is easier to find a card with visual support, I create my own screenshots for the cards in a manual, but streamlined, process, I want to show you here.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Misc","_id":"clp036auo003ylvpw2qu40uqf"}],"tags":[{"name":"Trello","_id":"clp036av5005nlvpw6wjhezcd"},{"name":"Android","_id":"clp036avy008alvpwh6x34x0h"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clp036avz008elvpw2yy1hsls"}],"_path":"post/Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/","_id":"clp036asm0012lvpw10vqhhbz"},{"title":"Generate Content from Trello","date":"2022-12-29T11:08:00.000Z","description":"<p>I’m collecting&#x2F;bookmarking links to interesting website post on a public Trello board and aggregating them from time to time in a special post series called <em>Discoveries</em>, where I present 10 of them in one post on a specific topic.</p>\n<p>Writing these summaries is currently still a bit time-consuming, because in addition to the link, the name of the author and a small description, I would also like to display a screenshot of the page in each case … and it is still a completely manual process.</p>\n<p>After selecting the 10 links I want to talk about, I first create a new post for my Hexo blog and then process the links as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Creating, resizing and saving the screenshot</li>\n<li>Creating a new section in the post</li>\n<li>Setting a key for the post based on the title</li>\n<li>Setting the title</li>\n<li>Setting the author</li>\n<li>Setting the screenshot file</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I do use two tag plugins (<a href=\"https://github.com/kristofzerbe/kiko.io/blob/2c80a548e188c05879039a15e67419b548bfbfcd/themes/landscape/scripts/tag-anchorlist.js\">tag-anchorlist</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/kristofzerbe/kiko.io/blob/2c80a548e188c05879039a15e67419b548bfbfcd/themes/landscape/scripts/tag-discovery.js\">tag-discovery</a>) for this in the post draft, but despite that, it’s quite time-consuming and always the same procedure that can be wonderfully automated… and here I’d like to write about how I approached this task, while I’m working on it.</p>","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","_id":"clp036aur0048lvpw6kbdb37j"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","_id":"clp036auo003xlvpw8w581njn"},{"name":"Trello","_id":"clp036av5005nlvpw6wjhezcd"},{"name":"Publishing","_id":"clp036avg006olvpwcb963pye"}],"_path":"post/Generate-Content-from-Trello/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Generate-Content-from-Trello/","_id":"clp036at8002llvpwftzvga40"},{"title":"Add Link to Trello on Android via Share Menu","date":"2023-11-13T16:11:47.000Z","description":"<p>I have been collecting interesting links in various Trello boards for many years and also process some of them automatically, such as my <a href=\"/collections/tiny-tools\">Tiny Tools</a>.</p>\n<p>However, the official Trello Android App has the problem eversince that, when you want to create a URL as a Trello card in the browser, the URL is entered in the <code>Description</code> and not as an <code>Attachment</code>, where it actually belongs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Add-Link-to-Trello-on-Android-via-Share-Menu/share-trello-app.png\" alt=\"Share Link with Trello App\"></p>\n<p>I have solved this for myself for years using a <strong>bookmarklet</strong> in the Chrome browser (see <a href=\"/post/Add-website-to-Trello-card-the-better-way/\" title=\"Add website to Trello card the better way\">Add website to Trello card the better way</a>) and get along quite well with it. However, there is one catch, that has annoyed me ever since:<br>I find an interesting link in the Mastodon WebApp, for example, and tap on it. What opens, however, is the WebView integrated in Android and not my standard Chrome browser, in which the bookmarklet would be available. So, for links that I want to store, I always have to open the WebView menu and select “Open in Chrome Browser”. I cannot use the general SHARE menu. At least not so far … :)</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clp036aup0042lvpwcpp7h5qj"}],"tags":[{"name":"Trello","_id":"clp036av5005nlvpw6wjhezcd"},{"name":"Android","_id":"clp036avy008alvpwh6x34x0h"}],"_path":"post/Add-Link-to-Trello-on-Android-via-Share-Menu/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Add-Link-to-Trello-on-Android-via-Share-Menu/","_id":"clp036atb002wlvpwd04b9wfd"}]}
