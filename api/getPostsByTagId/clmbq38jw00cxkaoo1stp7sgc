This allows the user to quickly get a picture of, say, the last dozen posts when he comes here to browse your texts.</p>\n<p>However, it is somewhat unpleasant if you as the author decide to display a larger excerpt after all, and the user lands at the top of the called page after clicking on the MORE link and first has to scroll&#x2F;navigate to the right place until he can resume reading. This destroys his reading flow. It is better to take the user directly to the page where the MORE link interrupted the text on the home page.</p>\n<p>With a hash and some JavaScript this is done so quickly, that I wonder why I havenâ€™t implemented this on my own blog already :)</p>","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","_id":"clmbq38g7003qkaoo37998079"}],"tags":[{"name":"UI","_id":"clmbq38g2003hkaoo8rb8ap6w"},{"name":"Usability","_id":"clmbq38jw00cxkaoo1stp7sgc"}],"_path":"post/CONTINUE-READING-Link-Auto-Scrolling-on-the-called-page/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/CONTINUE-READING-Link-Auto-Scrolling-on-the-called-page/","_id":"clmbq38ef002wkaoo0fuh1fpi"}]}
