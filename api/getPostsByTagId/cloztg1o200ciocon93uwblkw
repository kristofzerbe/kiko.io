As it depends on Bootstrap I was able to use the <a href=\"https://icons.getbootstrap.com/\">icons from Bootstrap</a>. At the beginning I needed only a handful of these icons, but with the time it became more and more difficult to find the right one, because the Bootstrap Glyphicons in version 3 included only around 250 icons and there was not always the right one. Also, the app was always lugging around well over 100 KB of extra files, of which I actually only needed a few kilobytes.</p>\n<p>In another project I had used <a href=\"https://fontello.com/\">Fontello</a>, where you can build and download your own icon font from a selection of available icons. Very nice, but I didnâ€™t feel like fiddling with project-specific configuration files on the Fontello website. But since you could upload your own SVG files in Fontello, which were then taken over into the font, the same had to work somehow with a Node.JS plugin!?</p>\n<p>And yes <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-iconfont\">gulp-iconfont</a> from <a href=\"https://github.com/nfroidure\">Nicolas Froidure</a> was exactly what I needed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Creating-Icon-Font-from-SVG-Files/gulp-iconfont.png\" alt=\"gulp-iconfont on GitHub\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"First-Solution\"><a href=\"#First-Solution\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"First Solution\"></a>First Solution</h2><p>Just copy a bunch of SVG files in a folder, run gulp and there was my own customized icon font with a tolerable size of around 20 kilobytes. At that time, <a href=\"https://github.com/backflip\">Thomas Jaggi</a> had taken care of the creation of a CSS file with the correct code points that matched the font with his tool <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-iconfont-css\">gulp-iconfont-css</a>.</p>","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","_id":"cloztg1lv0047oconfropc1w8"}],"tags":[{"name":"Bundling","_id":"cloztg1mo006yoconh0ki1ko7"},{"name":"SVG","_id":"cloztg1nr00bjoconf1mz36ge"},{"name":"Font","_id":"cloztg1o200ciocon93uwblkw"}],"_path":"post/Creating-Icon-Font-from-SVG-Files/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Creating-Icon-Font-from-SVG-Files/","_id":"cloztg1kc002docon4tg06s10"}]}
