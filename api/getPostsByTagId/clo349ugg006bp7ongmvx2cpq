We have learned that well and no one questions it … but … the IT world keeps on turning and today we are not only talking about files, but about links.</p>\n<p>Many modern applications are written with Web technologies, thanks to cross platform frameworks like <a href=\"https://www.electronjs.org/\">Electron</a>. Some of them are real apps for working on things, like the famous editor <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>, and some are mirroring their online services in a desktop app only, like <a href=\"https://slack.com/intl/en-de/downloads/windows\">Slack</a> or <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/desktop\">Notion</a>. However, the latter have the problem how to deal with links to their online services. When a user is sent a link and has become accustomed to using the desktop app, it won’t open in the app as he clicks on it, but in his default browser. The question is, how to associate not only files, but links with certain desktop apps?</p>","categories":[{"name":"Misc","_id":"clo349uff003rp7on09r4dhlg"}],"tags":[{"name":"Browser","_id":"clo349ufh003wp7on422d10dc"},{"name":"Windows","_id":"clo349ugg006bp7ongmvx2cpq"},{"name":"PWA","_id":"clo349uha008dp7oncxxf6soa"}],"_path":"post/Application-Specific-Links-on-Windows-10/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Application-Specific-Links-on-Windows-10/","_id":"clo349ucv0013p7on0pmr7gme"},{"title":"Spice Up Windows Terminal","date":"2020-12-24T14:03:15.000Z","description":"<p>Working with the PowerShell in 2020 means fun, because of the new <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701\"><strong>Windows Terminal</strong> (get it from Windows Store)</a>.

However, most of them are relatively junk or try to foist malware on users. You have to make sure that you separate the wheat from the chaff. On the other hand, the situation is surprisingly different for Windows, the much older operating system. The older ones of us will still remember the glorious WinAmp times, whose current owner Radionomy has been making a very long new attempt for a new version 6 since 2018 (version 5.8 is already a handsome 6 years old), but you can actually count the good music players for Windows 10 and higher on one hand, if you subtract the streaming apps such as Spotify and Co. and disregard everything that comes along as a jack of all trades and can ALSO play MP3. The best known are the in Windows included and miserably failed iTunes clone from Micosoft called <strong>Groove</strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.aimp.ru/\">AIMP</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.foobar2000.org/\">foobar2000</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.mediamonkey.com/\">MediaMonkey</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.getmusicbee.com/\">MusicBee</a></strong>.

If you look at the download pages of these music player candidates and try to look behind the business model, some of them simply do not download. One or the other player also overdoes it with the featuritis.
