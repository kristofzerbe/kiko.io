I described the way to do this in <a href=\"/post/Show-pages-meta-data-JSON-LD-in-Bottom-Sheet/\">a post</a> a couple three weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Shortly after that <a href=\"https://octodon.social/@koos\">Koos Looijensteijn</a> triggered me with his post <a href=\"https://www.kooslooijesteijn.net/blog/digital-business-cards-vcard-qr-code-website\">How to make digital business cards and share them via QR codes</a> and I felt like using my newly introduced dialog manager based on downupPopup for my own contact card.<br><strong>But more about that at a later time, respectively blog post…</strong></p>\n<p>Important for this post is that Ali’s bottom sheet solution did not offer everything I wanted for my implementation:</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-Make-Dialog-Reusable\"><a href=\"#1-Make-Dialog-Reusable\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1. Make Dialog Reusable\"></a>1. Make Dialog Reusable</h2><p>As I have already described in the above mentioned article: Ali’s approach to calling the dialog was to create and initialize the necessary HTML elements if it didn’t already exist in the DOM. I pulled out the initialization to make the component reusable. There is now a preparation part and an initialization part and the latter is always called, no matter if another bottom sheet dialog was already created before.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ali-dincer/downupPopup.js/pull/2/commits/f3751ca56c4809decc1ec3845e5c301a13292773\">My GitHub commit on this part</a>…</p>","categories":[{"name":"UI/UX","_id":"clkcurc5v004ciroo95sb4hgt"}],"tags":[{"name":"GitHub","_id":"clkcurc5d003firoogymb5k1w"},{"name":"jQuery","_id":"clkcurc5n003xiroogzmfbkxj"},{"name":"UI","_id":"clkcurca800biiroofqrs9rj5"},{"name":"Contributing","_id":"clkcurcbb00coiroo5tk13rje"}],"_path":"post/Extension-of-downupPopup-Back-Button-Escape-Key-More/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Extension-of-downupPopup-Back-Button-Escape-Key-More/","_id":"clkcurc3g002zirood8s93bcb"},{"title":"Favourite Pens of 2022","date":"2023-01-14T12:10:48.000Z","description":"<p>Every year CodePen publishes a list of the 100 most “liked” pens on their site: <a href=\"https://codepen.io/2022/popular/\">The Most Hearted of 2022</a>. It’s always exciting to scroll through the list and marvel at the incredibly good work of CSS artists. </p>\n<p>My favorite in terms of CSS coding art this year is the work <a href=\"https://codepen.io/ivorjetski/pen/yLjeqgb\">A moment of pure CSS</a> by Ben Evans. Absolutely amazing what he does with pure CSS:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Favourite-Pens-of-2022/a-moment-of-pure-css.png\" alt=\"Really ... no image involved!\"></p>\n<p>From all these works you can take a lot of know-how for yourself, but many of these pens have no practical use at first, i.e. you can’t really use them directly on your own website. They are art. Some of them impressed me not only because of their creativity, but I saved them on my own Trello list to try them out in one of the next projects. Partly they are clever approaches regarding usability, partly more or less standard functions were implemented in a visually impressive way. Some of them need some JS to work, sime of them not.
