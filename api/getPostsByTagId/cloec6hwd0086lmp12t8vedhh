To add a new card, I use a simple little script on my Android smartphone, I wrote about here: <a href=\"/post/Add-website-to-Trello-card-the-better-way/\" title=\"Add website to Trello card the better way\">Add website to Trello card the better way</a>.</p>\n<p>On processing the page to store on a card, Trello scrapes the page and takes the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag <code>og:image</code> out of the HTML to generate an image attachment and take it as cover for the card. This sometimes works, but most of the time it doesn’t, because website owners often don’t pay attention to reasonable <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n<p>Because it is easier to find a card with visual support, I create my own screenshots for the cards in a manual, but streamlined, process, I want to show you here.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Misc","_id":"cloec6hun003ulmp14icqdey4"}],"tags":[{"name":"Trello","_id":"cloec6hva005jlmp1hf4e8yg9"},{"name":"Android","_id":"cloec6hwd0086lmp12t8vedhh"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"cloec6hwe008almp12n4p35xs"}],"_path":"post/Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/","_id":"cloec6hs30012lmp1h6ud2ahr"},{"title":"Handling IPTC metadata on Android and Windows","date":"2023-10-28T12:00:55.000Z","description":"<p>Most of the photos that I prepare for this website for example, I take with my big Nikon camera in RAW format and then edit them under Windows in <strong>Adobe Lightroom Classic</strong>. I always give the image a name and a few keywords, which are then also displayed on the photo page. Lightroom stores these as <a href=\"https://www.iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/\"><strong>IPTC metadata</strong></a> in the sidecar file and writes them, when exporting the image, directly into the header of the generated JPG file.</p>\n<p>Now, however, I take pictures on the go with my Pixel smartphone and process them with the Google Photos Android app, and although the <strong>IPTC</strong> standard is only 30 years old, <strong>Google doesn’t support it!</strong> You can give the image a “description” but it is not written into the image as a metadata, but is probably lying around somewhere on the Google servers.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Photo","_id":"cloec6hv2004ylmp1assges87"}],"tags":[{"name":"Windows","_id":"cloec6hvm006elmp1cjn8cvbz"},{"name":"Android","_id":"cloec6hwd0086lmp12t8vedhh"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"cloec6hwe008almp12n4p35xs"},{"name":"Metadata","_id":"cloec6hyn00eblmp1gtf6cto7"}],"_path":"post/Handling-IPTC-metadata-on-Android-and-Windows/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Handling-IPTC-metadata-on-Android-and-Windows/","_id":"cloec6ht60037lmp1cd1q95om"}]}
