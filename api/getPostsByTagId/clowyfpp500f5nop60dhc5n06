He had come by a happy coincidence to two tickets. Of course! Let’s go!</p>\n<p>Now I’m not an Eintracht fan, by any means. In the Rhine-Main area, the Frankfurt club is either hated or loved by the people, because its fan base is a bit more aggressive, i.e. they are disreputable and with them the club. But I’ve never been to the <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldstadion\">Waldstadion</a> (as it used to be called) or the “Deutsche Bank Park” (as it’s called if you put money on the table), one of the big soccer arenas in Germany, where international matches and other big events are also held regularly.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"clowyfpnb00a3nop6fk8r9hj6"}],"tags":[{"name":"Eintracht","_id":"clowyfpp500f5nop60dhc5n06"}],"_path":"post/SGE-vs-HJK-2023-10-26/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/SGE-vs-HJK-2023-10-26/","_id":"clowyfpk2003jnop67tb78vj0"}]}
