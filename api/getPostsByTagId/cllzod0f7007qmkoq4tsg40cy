To add a new card, I use a simple little script on my Android smartphone, I wrote about here: <a href=\"/post/Add-website-to-Trello-card-the-better-way/\" title=\"Add website to Trello card the better way\">Add website to Trello card the better way</a>.</p>\n<p>On processing the page to store on a card, Trello scrapes the page and takes the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag <code>og:image</code> out of the HTML to generate an image attachment and take it as cover for the card. This sometimes works, but most of the time it doesn’t, because website owners often don’t pay attention to reasonable <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n<p>Because it is easier to find a card with visual support, I create my own screenshots for the cards in a manual, but streamlined, process, I want to show you here.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Misc","_id":"cllzod0d50037mkoq7b2y57np"}],"tags":[{"name":"Trello","_id":"cllzod0e00053mkoqga5t1qjg"},{"name":"Android","_id":"cllzod0f7007qmkoq4tsg40cy"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"cllzod0f8007umkoq31dfbls2"}],"_path":"post/Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/","_id":"cllzod0ab0012mkoq76mv63wr"}]}
