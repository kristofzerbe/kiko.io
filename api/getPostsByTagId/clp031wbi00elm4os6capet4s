I always give the image a name and a few keywords, which are then also displayed on the photo page. Lightroom stores these as <a href=\"https://www.iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/\"><strong>IPTC metadata</strong></a> in the sidecar file and writes them, when exporting the image, directly into the header of the generated JPG file.</p>\n<p>Now, however, I take pictures on the go with my Pixel smartphone and process them with the Google Photos Android app, and although the <strong>IPTC</strong> standard is only 30 years old, <strong>Google doesn’t support it!</strong> You can give the image a “description” but it is not written into the image as a metadata, but is probably lying around somewhere on the Google servers.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Photo","_id":"clp031w8w0052m4os6e685kbl"}],"tags":[{"name":"Windows","_id":"clp031w9b006im4os20vo1ggs"},{"name":"Android","_id":"clp031wag00azm4osbpad8cmy"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clp031wah00b1m4os7823hcu9"},{"name":"Metadata","_id":"clp031wbi00elm4os6capet4s"}],"_path":"post/Handling-IPTC-metadata-on-Android-and-Windows/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Handling-IPTC-metadata-on-Android-and-Windows/","_id":"clp031w7f0039m4os053e4j00"}]}
