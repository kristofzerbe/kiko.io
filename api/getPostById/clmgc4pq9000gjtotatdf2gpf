As you can’t actually create such a Bookmarklet in your Android Chrome, you have to create it in your desktop Chrome and switch on the bookmark sync of chrome. You should right away choose a short, concise name for the bookmark, so you find it easier in Android Chrome afterwards. I called it <strong>2TrelloCard</strong>, because few websites start with an number.</p>\n<p>After Chrome’s sync is done, go to any website do you want to store as a Trello card. Now enter the Url box and type the name of the bookmarklet and select it.</p>\n<p>Instead of requesting a different page, Chrome executes the JavaScript of the Bookmarklet against the currently open website. This script shows a Trello dialog, where you can choose, which board and list the new card should be created on.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Add-website-to-Trello-card-the-better-way/open-bookmarklet.gif\" alt=\"Open Bookmarklet on Website in Android Chrome\"></p>\n<p>This card creation method not only sets the title of the card, but fills the description with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element\">meta description</a> of the page, adds the first found meta image as cover and adds the Url as an attachment:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Add-website-to-Trello-card-the-better-way/card-via-bookmarklet.png\" alt=\"Trello card via Bookmarklet\"></p>\n","_path":"post/Add-website-to-Trello-card-the-better-way/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Add-website-to-Trello-card-the-better-way/","_id":"clmgc4pq9000gjtotatdf2gpf"}}
