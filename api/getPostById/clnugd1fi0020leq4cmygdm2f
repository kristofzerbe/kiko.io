Spotlight has different options, but the easiest one is to download the <strong>bundled version</strong>, which includes both the JS files and the image (icon) and CSS files. For the non-bundles files, you can choose the minified versions or even the original ES6 and LESS files. There is a NPM package also.</p>\n<p>For the implementation you can either choose a declarative way using the <code>spotlight</code> class, where the shown thumb images to click on needs to have a wrapper…</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight html\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">a</span> <span class=\"attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;spotlight&quot;</span> <span class=\"attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;img1.jpg&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">img</span> <span class=\"attr\">src</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;thumb1.jpg&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"name\">a</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">a</span> <span class=\"attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;spotlight&quot;</span> <span class=\"attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;img2.jpg&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">img</span> <span class=\"attr\">src</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;thumb2.jpg&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"name\">a</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>… or programmatically via JavaScript:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> gallery = [</span><br><span class=\"line\">    &#123; <span class=\"attr\">src</span>: <span class=\"string\">&quot;img1.jpg&quot;</span> &#125;,</span><br><span class=\"line\">    &#123; <span class=\"attr\">src</span>: <span class=\"string\">&quot;img2.jpg&quot;</span> &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">];</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"title class_\">Spotlight</span>.<span class=\"title function_\">show</span>(gallery <span class=\"comment\">/*, options */</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>Next to the image, at the bottom left corner, a title, a description and&#x2F;or a button can be displayed on a gallery slide, which is completely compatible with all types of devices.</p>\n<p>It is possible to define image groups to show separately in the declaration mode by having an extra wrapper around a bunch of image wrappers. All options how the gallery has to be shown are also declarative:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight html\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">div</span> <span class=\"attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;spotlight-group&quot;</span> </span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">     <span class=\"attr\">data-title</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;Group title&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">a</span> <span class=\"attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;spotlight&quot;</span> <span class=\"attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;img1.jpg&quot;</span> </span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">       <span class=\"attr\">data-title</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;This is a title&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">        <span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">img</span> <span class=\"attr\">src</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;thumb1.jpg&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"name\">a</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">a</span> <span class=\"attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;spotlight&quot;</span> <span class=\"attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;img2.jpg&quot;</span> </span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">       <span class=\"attr\">data-title</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;This is another title&quot;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">       <span class=\"attr\">data-description</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;This is a description&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">        <span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">img</span> <span class=\"attr\">src</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;thumb2.jpg&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"name\">a</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"name\">div</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>Spotlight has 9 built-in controls to show in the bar at the top left:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fullscreen</li>\n<li>Zoom in</li>\n<li>Zoom out</li>\n<li>Autofit</li>\n<li>Close</li>\n<li>Theme</li>\n<li>Play (Slideshow)</li>\n<li>Download</li>\n</ul>\n<p>… and there is a possibility to insert custom controls during initialization.</p>\n<p>If you provide several image sizes, Spotlight picks the optimal version regarding the current devices resolution, pixel ratio and bandwidth. But Spotlight is not limited to images. It can also display videos and even custom HTML fragments (DOM nodes) as slides.</p>\n<p>Through its JavaScript API you can fully remote control the gallery and it has several options to customize the appearance of the slides to every need you can imagine.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The implementation is a breeze. It took me less than 10 minutes to get Spotlight working here on this blog at the <a href=\"/photos\">photo page</a>!</p>\n<p>I can’t think of any use case right now, that you couldn’t implement easily and quickly with this amazing library. Congrats folks … extremely well done!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nextapps-de.github.io/spotlight/\"><img src=\"/post/The-Last-Image-Gallery/logo.png\" alt=\"Spotlight logo\"></a></p>\n","_path":"post/The-Last-Image-Gallery/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/The-Last-Image-Gallery/","_id":"clnugd1fi0020leq4cmygdm2f"}}
