I won’t go into the general functionality of Hexo here, but the ones that interest me most for my particular needs. A more or less good start into the tool is <a href=\"https://hexo.io/\">https://hexo.io</a> with its DOCS and API.</p>\n<p>One of the first commands you get to know is <code>generate</code>, which generates the static HTML pages from the MD files stored in the <code>source/_posts</code> folder. You can add your own <a href=\"https://hexo.io/api/generator\">generators</a>, which can generate any other custom pages, to this process and put them under <code>themes/&lt;your-theme/scripts</code> for automatic execution. Every generator has a <code>locals</code> argument, which holds all site variables, including a list of all posts.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the documentation at <a href=\"https://hexo.io/api/\">hexo.io&#x2F;api</a> is rather poor and so only after a while I realized, that a custom generator is called relatively late in the process, when the MD files have long since been preprocessed. So you can process any MD files in a generator, but you have to do without the automatic processing of the powerful <a href=\"https://hexo.io/docs/tag-plugins\">Tag Plugins</a> or syntax highlighting, because this takes place in an upstream <a href=\"https://hexo.io/api/processor\">processor</a>, which deals with <a href=\"https://hexo.io/api/box\">boxes</a>.</p>\n<p>I don’t understand Hexo’s concept at this point. For me it is not particularly catchy and straightforward. Unfortunately a few help-, discussion- and example pages are written in Chinese, since the creator Tommy Chen is from Taiwan, as I guess, but my Chinese really sucks… ;)</p>\n<p>The best thing about Hexo in general is, that you can get your first results quickly after the basic installation, so you are able to concentrate on writing and prettying things up for a while. Only when the requirements increase is it necessary to take a closer look at the insufficiently documented substructure. A challenge even for experienced web developers, but unfortunately absolutely impossible for beginners…</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Posts\"><a href=\"#Posts\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Posts\"></a>Posts</h2><p>Hexo is based on a structure of posts and pages, where posts can be aggregated in various ways, whether in the time-based archive or via tags and categories. Posts has to have a specific structure, regarding the Frontmatter in the MD file and teh storage of attached images. Hexo offers the user a separate command for this: <code>hexo new</code>, which works with template files in the folder <code>scaffolds</code>.</p>\n<p>For the presentation of my posts, I decided to incorporate my passion of photography by assigning a unique header image to each post (and most pages). How I implemented this, I have described in the article <a href=\"/post/Automatic-Header-Images-in-Hexo/\" title=\"Automatic Header Images in Hexo\">Automatic Header Images in Hexo</a>. The main point is, when I create a new post, I automatically and randomly pick a photo (in the three media-dependent versions <em>normal</em>, <em>tablet</em> and <em>mobile</em>) from a pool, copy the images to the appropriate delivery folder and bind it to the new post via frontmatter. For this I’ve written the Hexo event hook <code>on-new-get-photo-for-post.js</code>, which runs on the command <code>hexo new post &quot;&lt;title-of-new-post&gt;&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>Works great, except for the fact that I’m often on the go and using a Node.JS-powered command towards an SSG project hosted on GitHub definitely doesn’t work on an Android smartphone. So, how do I get it to create a new post remotely?</p>\n<p>First part of the answer, regarding access to all project files, was to store the project in a folder that is synchronized with one of the usual suspects: Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive. With this, I have access to the entire project at all times on all devices that can sync the files. In the case of Android with the help of one of the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=metactrl+%22autosync%22&c=apps\">Autosync apps from metactrl</a>.</p>\n<p>The second part of the answer, regarding execution of the new post command, was a bit more difficult, but part of my solution was to use my little home server, where the project also syncs and which is always switched on. Problem here: This tiny box is not publicly available on the web and never will be. Therefore the only communication channel I had, was file synchronization and the solution was to use a simple text file to hold the commands I want to be executed. For this purpose, I have written a small command line tool that runs and processes a modified command file when it is received. For file monitoring I have <a href=\"https://www.2brightsparks.com/syncback/sbpro.html\">SyncBackPro</a> in use, which has the incredibly useful feature of being able to execute commands before and after a synchronization takes place, in this case my tool, which I have named <strong>HexoCommander</strong> and whose source code is <a href=\"https://github.com/kristofzerbe/HexoCommander\">available on GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"alertbox alertbox-note\">\n      <p>Before you think “<em>What the hell is he doing? That’s what</em> [fill in the Linux tool of your choice] <em>is for</em>“ … I’m more of a Windows guy. Linux means something to me, but I’ve never worked with it and never had to … and yessss, there is a career in IT also with Windows ;)</p>\n\n    </div>\n  \n\n<p>The advantage of synchronizing the whole GitHub project via cloud storage service is that I also host <strong>kiko.io</strong> on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> and that a commit to the repository on GitHub automatically triggers a deployment, which I don’t always want right away. So, because of my changes to the post process, I don’t use Hexo’s built-in drafts, but write on a new post until I’m done and then release by committing to GitHub.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"alertbox thinkbox\">\n      <svg viewBox=\"0 0 36 36\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><circle cx=\"18\" cy=\"17.018\" fill=\"#ffcb4c\" r=\"17\"/><g fill=\"#65471b\"><path d=\"m14.524 21.036c-.145-.116-.258-.274-.312-.464-.134-.46.13-.918.59-1.021 4.528-1.021 7.577 1.363 7.706 1.465.384.306.459.845.173 1.205-.286.358-.828.401-1.211.097-.11-.084-2.523-1.923-6.182-1.098-.274.061-.554-.016-.764-.184z\"/><ellipse cx=\"13.119\" cy=\"11.174\" rx=\"2.125\" ry=\"2.656\"/><ellipse cx=\"24.375\" cy=\"12.236\" rx=\"2.125\" ry=\"2.656\"/></g><path d=\"m17.276 35.149s1.265-.411 1.429-1.352c.173-.972-.624-1.167-.624-1.167s1.041-.208 1.172-1.376c.123-1.101-.861-1.363-.861-1.363s.97-.4 1.016-1.539c.038-.959-.995-1.428-.995-1.428s5.038-1.221 5.556-1.341c.516-.12 1.32-.615 1.069-1.694-.249-1.08-1.204-1.118-1.697-1.003-.494.115-6.744 1.566-8.9 2.068l-1.439.334c-.54.127-.785-.11-.404-.512.508-.536.833-1.129.946-2.113.119-1.035-.232-2.313-.433-2.809-.374-.921-1.005-1.649-1.734-1.899-1.137-.39-1.945.321-1.542 1.561.604 1.854.208 3.375-.833 4.293-2.449 2.157-3.588 3.695-2.83 6.973.828 3.575 4.377 5.876 7.952 5.048z\" fill=\"#f19020\"/><path d=\"m9.296 6.351c-.164-.088-.303-.224-.391-.399-.216-.428-.04-.927.393-1.112 4.266-1.831 7.699-.043 7.843.034.433.231.608.747.391 1.154-.216.405-.74.546-1.173.318-.123-.063-2.832-1.432-6.278.047-.257.109-.547.085-.785-.042zm12.135 3.75c-.156-.098-.286-.243-.362-.424-.187-.442.023-.927.468-1.084 4.381-1.536 7.685.48 7.823.567.415.26.555.787.312 1.178-.242.39-.776.495-1.191.238-.12-.072-2.727-1.621-6.267-.379-.266.091-.553.046-.783-.096z\" fill=\"#65471b\"/></svg>\n      <h4>is there an easier way?</h4>\n      <p>I admit that on an Android smartphone, it’s a bit fiddly to write a special command to a text file and then wait 2 or 3 minutes for the file to sync, the new line to be read and executed, and the new post files to sync back to the smartphone, but it works.

This page is not one that comes with Hexo, but is based on a dynamic page generator I’ve created for this purpose.

So when something comes to mind that I want to post on Mastodon for example, I want it to end up in a new Note MD file that is then posted, preferably automatically.</p>\n<p>For me, notes differ from normal posts. From the beginning I wanted to present them chronologically connected on one page per year, like a diary, and not to mix them with the articles (posts). So a standard treatment as a Hexo post was out of the question and I had to come up with something of my own. Another reason not to work with the standard structures of Hexo was, that I did not want to create a subfolder with the name of the post for images as usual in Hexo, but one folder for all images of a year.</p>\n<p>Since I am familiar with Hexo generators, I built a new one called <code>generator-notes</code> that iterates through the entire <code>source/_notes</code> folder and generates an index file for all the notes in a year, as well as the notes file itself, and copies the images to the source path.</p>\n<p>This approach also freed me from using my HexoCommander, because there is no need of executing a <code>new xxx</code> command. I can now create new Notes from the smartphone quite easily:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=metactrl+%22autosync%22&c=apps\">Autosync App</a>: Synchronization of the source&#x2F;notes folder</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.gsantner.markor\">Markor</a>: Edit or create new Note MD file via snippet.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub PWA</a>: Upload MD file to the appropriate folder of the repository</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The upload will automatically trigger the build and deployment to GitHub.

I would have liked to use a GitHub action for the entire deployment, including the generation of the output files, but for a long time there was no NPM package with a working Hexo version that would have allowed this.</p>\n<p>I recently checked again to see if the current Hexo release 6.0.3. had fixed my bug and the subsequent bugs …. and yes.

The idea behind it is to mention an article from blog A in a post on Blog B or social media like Twitter or Mastodon and blog A gets an automated message like “<em>Hey, I’ve mentioned you here</em>“. The operator of Blog A can now also automatically display this message under the article mentioned.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Receiving-Webmentions\"><a href=\"#Receiving-Webmentions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Receiving Webmentions\"></a>Receiving Webmentions</h3><p>kiko.io is a static site, therefore, there are no active components on the web server that could react to an incoming webmention. But that’s not a problem, because there are services like <a href=\"https://webmention.io/\">webmention.io</a> that can serve as recipients and from where you can then pick up the messages. Some bloggers do this by fetching and inserting them into the articles while generating the static pages, but for me this can take too long.

Unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p>Another possibility would be to utilize my Atom feed by setting up a Zapier, IFTT or Make&#x2F;Integromat task, which picks the last added entry and run the <a href=\"https://telegraph.p3k.io/api\">Telegraph API</a> against it.</p>\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n\n    </div>\n  \n\n<h3 id=\"Publish-on-Mastodon\"><a href=\"#Publish-on-Mastodon\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Publish on Mastodon\"></a>Publish on Mastodon</h3><p>I’m relatively new to Mastodon (Nov 22), but in the past I have syndicated some of my posts manually on Twitter. Now, that I’ve said goodbye to the greedy bird site, I’m thinking about how I’m going to automate publishing the notes in particular, but also at least an excerpt from a post, on Mastodon.</p>\n<p>What I do in the meantime? After the site is successfully deployed, I open up my Mastodon client and copy the complete content of a note or write an excerpt of a post manually into a new toot and append the permalink. After hitting SEND, I copy the newly created Mastodon post URL into a Frontmatter attribute called <code>syndication</code> of the note or post and commit the file to GitHub. Build and deployment runs again and the syndication link will be visible on kiko.io.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/The-State-of-the-Blog/kiko-io-SYNDICATION.png\" alt=\"kiko.io&#39;s Syndication Workflow\"></p>\n\n    <div class=\"alertbox thinkbox\">\n      <svg viewBox=\"0 0 36 36\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><circle cx=\"18\" cy=\"17.018\" fill=\"#ffcb4c\" r=\"17\"/><g fill=\"#65471b\"><path d=\"m14.524 21.036c-.145-.116-.258-.274-.312-.464-.134-.46.13-.918.59-1.021 4.528-1.021 7.577 1.363 7.706 1.465.384.306.459.845.173 1.205-.286.358-.828.401-1.211.097-.11-.084-2.523-1.923-6.182-1.098-.274.061-.554-.016-.764-.184z\"/><ellipse cx=\"13.119\" cy=\"11.174\" rx=\"2.125\" ry=\"2.656\"/><ellipse cx=\"24.375\" cy=\"12.236\" rx=\"2.125\" ry=\"2.656\"/></g><path d=\"m17.276 35.149s1.265-.411 1.429-1.352c.173-.972-.624-1.167-.624-1.167s1.041-.208 1.172-1.376c.123-1.101-.861-1.363-.861-1.363s.97-.4 1.016-1.539c.038-.959-.995-1.428-.995-1.428s5.038-1.221 5.556-1.341c.516-.12 1.32-.615 1.069-1.694-.249-1.08-1.204-1.118-1.697-1.003-.494.115-6.744 1.566-8.9 2.068l-1.439.334c-.54.127-.785-.11-.404-.512.508-.536.833-1.129.946-2.113.119-1.035-.232-2.313-.433-2.809-.374-.921-1.005-1.649-1.734-1.899-1.137-.39-1.945.321-1.542 1.561.604 1.854.208 3.375-.833 4.293-2.449 2.157-3.588 3.695-2.83 6.973.828 3.575 4.377 5.876 7.952 5.048z\" fill=\"#f19020\"/><path d=\"m9.296 6.351c-.164-.088-.303-.224-.391-.399-.216-.428-.04-.927.393-1.112 4.266-1.831 7.699-.043 7.843.034.433.231.608.747.391 1.154-.216.405-.74.546-1.173.318-.123-.063-2.832-1.432-6.278.047-.257.109-.547.085-.785-.042zm12.135 3.75c-.156-.098-.286-.243-.362-.424-.187-.442.023-.927.468-1.084 4.381-1.536 7.685.48 7.823.567.415.26.555.787.312 1.178-.242.39-.776.495-1.191.238-.12-.072-2.727-1.621-6.267-.379-.266.091-.553.046-.783-.096z\" fill=\"#65471b\"/></svg>\n      <h4>is there an easier way?</h4>\n      <p>The Mastodon API is really simple and there are many examples written in Python, JS and other languages out there that are easy to adapt. But here I have the same problem as when sending webmentions: the target url is not yet available at the time of generating the page, when some code is running to do something. It must be a downstream task as well. I need some kind of service running on a server, where I only have a static site. Independent GitHub Action or Azure Function, triggered by a webhook after deployment is finished, which processes all notes and posts without the <code>syndication</code> Frontmatter? Or extending HexoCommander again, but how to trigger this buddy automatically, as he depends on file synchronization?</p>\n\n    </div>\n  \n\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Summary\"><a href=\"#Summary\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Summary\"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hexo is a good SSG system with which you can achieve good results in a short time and which leaves enough room for your own creative ideas. The documentation needs a lot of improvement, especially regarding the details in depth and enriched with examples. I’m not surprised that Hexo seems to lag behind other systems like Hugo or 11ty. Maybe this also have something to do with communication. It’s not as much of a conversation in the Western space as others. In the future, I have planed to be more involved in matters of documentation and communication, even though I have not yet understood the full complexity of the substructure.</p>\n<p>However, I enjoy working with Hexo despite or because of the shortcomings. Coding without a challenge is like driving on a highway … boring :)</p>\n<p>My workflows are currently not really straightforward, especially with regard to connectivity. However, this is also due to the fact that there are no reactive components working on “my” web server.</p>\n<p>It’s all still way too much tinkering, but it will be fun over the next few months to edit all the remarks in the “IS THERE AN EASIER WAY?” blocks above and continue to develop the blog.</p>\n","_path":"post/The-State-of-the-Blog/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/The-State-of-the-Blog/","_id":"clo349udt002up7ong1ht7rsv"}}
