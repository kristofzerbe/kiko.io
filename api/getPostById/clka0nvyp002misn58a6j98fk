The problem I faced after releasing the last version 1.9 in 2008 was on the one hand that Microsoft had fundamentally changed the handling of signatures in Outlook and on the other hand that VB6 was no longer really en-vogue, because everybody (and me too) was switching to VB.NET or C# and that would have meant a complete re-write for me. But there were already commercial alternatives to OutlookSignature at that time and I had turned to other projects, but it was available into 2012 until I decided to close my personal blog. However, to this day there are <a href=\"https://www.outlook-stuff.com/tipps-tricks/problemloesungen/717-einheitliche-outlook-signaturen-zentral-im-firmennetz-verwalten.html\">one</a> or <a href=\"https://moximo.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/automatische-outlooksignaturen-mit-informationen-aus-der-ads/\">two</a> websites where you can download or find information about it.</p>\n<p>OutlookSignature was always freeware, but never Open Source, because of the fact, that I used some code, that did not come from me and was not approved for publication.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Accidental-Discovery-of-a-Go-based-Implementation\"><a href=\"#Accidental-Discovery-of-a-Go-based-Implementation\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Accidental Discovery of a Go-based Implementation\"></a>Accidental Discovery of a Go-based Implementation</h2><p>I own the domain <em>zerbit.de</em> until today and the other day I was looking on the web for some references to it and stumbled across a GitHub page with the title <a href=\"https://github.com/foobar0815/gosignature\"><strong>An open source reimplementation of Kristof Zerbe’s (ZerbIT) “OutlookSignature”</strong></a> … What The Heck!?</p>\n<p>I don’t know who the user <a href=\"https://github.com/foobar0815\"><em>‘foobar0815’</em></a> is, but he&#x2F;she is definitely German and had the patience to rebuild my tool in the modern language Go in 2019.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Old-Sweetheart-Rediscovered/go-signature.png\" alt=\"GoSignature on GitHub\"></p>\n<p><strong>GoSignature</strong> uses the orginal INI configuation file, with the field mappings and all the other stuff, but the database connection feature. It works only with LDAP, which is quite enough today.</p>\n<p>I have no idea about Go, but I will certainly look into it a bit in the near future and find out if this thing works. If you have already tried GoSignature or even if you are the author, please contact me. Would be fun to talk about it…</p>\n<p>:)</p>\n","_path":"post/Old-Sweetheart-Rediscovered/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Old-Sweetheart-Rediscovered/","_id":"clka0nvyp002misn58a6j98fk"}}
