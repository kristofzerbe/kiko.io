I have to say that I am currently very interested in creating PWAs and the techniques behind them, and I’m always looking for new resources to read. So it didn’t take me 5 minutes to start reading posts in Mastodon with the hashtag <a href=\"https://indieweb.social/web/tags/pwa\">#pwa</a> almost automatically.</p>\n<p>What can I say? It works…</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Search for an hash tag, f.e. <code>#pwa</code>. It will lead to an Url like this, depending on your Mastodon server:</p>\n<p><code>https://indieweb.social/web/tags/pwa</code></p>\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Cut out <code>/web</code></p>\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Add <code>.rss</code></p>\n<p>… and you got your feed on a special topic …</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Syndicate-Mastodon-Hashtags-in-your-favorite-Feed-Reader/pwa-mastodon-feed.png\" alt=\"PWA Feed from Mastodon\"></p>\n<p>… you can add to your favorite feed reader.<br><img src=\"/post/Syndicate-Mastodon-Hashtags-in-your-favorite-Feed-Reader/feedly-pwa-feed.png\" alt=\"PWA Feed in Feedly\"></p>\n<p>Happy Reading…</p>\n","_path":"post/Syndicate-Mastodon-Hashtags-in-your-favorite-Feed-Reader/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Syndicate-Mastodon-Hashtags-in-your-favorite-Feed-Reader/","_id":"clmhxn6b8002rm1oh0dv435rf"}}
