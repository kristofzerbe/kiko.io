Insights shows you the big picture in form of an interactive graph or a complete list with many additional information of the complete dependency chain.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Open-Source-Insights-Seeing-the-big-picture/graph.png\" alt=\"Open Source Insights - Overview\"></p>\n<p>As Google says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your software and your users rely not only on the code you write, but also on the code your code depends on, the code that code depends on, and so on. An accurate view of the complete dependency graph is critical to understanding the state of your project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Next time, before you type <code>npm install ...</code> take a quick look at the Insights page of the library, because it won’t give you an overview over the dependecies only, but also some security advisories to let you decide if it is a good idea to use it.</p>\n<p>Very valueable for the authors of exisiting NPM projects also, because it shows the consequences of dependency decisions very clearly and gives hints to make the own library less sensitive to vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Let us hope, that Google removes the describing adjective <em>experimental</em> from the project some day and adds more and more functionality to it (like a working responsiveness ;) in order to establish <strong>Open Source Insights</strong> as a main source of information about reusable Open Source software.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://deps.dev/\"><img src=\"/post/Open-Source-Insights-Seeing-the-big-picture/logo.png\" alt=\"Logo\"></a></p>\n","_path":"post/Open-Source-Insights-Seeing-the-big-picture/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Open-Source-Insights-Seeing-the-big-picture/","_id":"cljodmhmp001ohpos3n65cq6q"}}
