This works at some degree, if there is a physical keyboard, but not really on mobile devices … and for me is leaving the field often too late to start the upcoming event.</p>\n<span id=\"more\"></span>\n\n<p>A better way to show the user the result of his entered value, could be the event <code>input</code> which fires on every key stroke, but could be way to often, if the triggered event is for example an AJAX call.</p>\n<p>Best solution is, to observe the users key strokes and trigger the event, when he stops typing. Then there is no extra action needed by the user and the event isn’t triggered multiple times. </p>\n<p>Here’s an implementation with jQuery:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">$(<span class=\"string\">&quot;#my-text-input&quot;</span>).<span class=\"title function_\">keyup</span>(<span class=\"keyword\">function</span> (<span class=\"params\"></span>) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> $this = $(<span class=\"variable language_\">this</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"built_in\">clearTimeout</span>($.<span class=\"title function_\">data</span>(<span class=\"variable language_\">this</span>, <span class=\"string\">&#x27;timer&#x27;</span>));</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> wait = <span class=\"built_in\">setTimeout</span>(<span class=\"keyword\">function</span> (<span class=\"params\"></span>) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">        <span class=\"comment\">//do something with the value...</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">    &#125;, <span class=\"number\">1000</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\">    $(<span class=\"variable language_\">this</span>).<span class=\"title function_\">data</span>(<span class=\"string\">&#x27;timer&#x27;</span>, wait);</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>Important is to wipe and set the timer on every key up, to achive that the event will be executed after 1 second after the last key stroke only.</p>\n","_path":"post/Better-Input-Change-Event/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Better-Input-Change-Event/","_id":"cllhuh2pm000ajzop9oen8c0e"}}
