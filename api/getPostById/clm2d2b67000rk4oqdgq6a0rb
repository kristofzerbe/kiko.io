From there I distribute them further.</p>\n<span id=\"more\"></span>\n\n<p>Important on this approach is, to have a coherent output folder structure in order find a particular image afterwards.</p>\n<p>I store my RAW images on an external hard drive in a structure like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight txt\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&lt;Drive:\\&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  -&gt;  Fotos</span><br><span class=\"line\">      -&gt;  &lt;Year&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\">          -&gt;  &lt;Year&gt;-&lt;Month&gt; &lt;Eventname&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>First step after shooting is to copy all RAW files from the SD Card into a new subfolder of the current year. From there I import them into my Lightroom catalog.</p>\n<p>After sorting, rejecting, editing and flagging in Lightroom, I have to “export” the 4- and 5-star rated images into the cloud. There I have a slightly different structure, with a different root folder name and without the year:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight txt\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&lt;Dropbox&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  -&gt;  Photos</span><br><span class=\"line\">      -&gt;  &lt;Year&gt;-&lt;Month&gt; &lt;Eventname&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>With the built-in “Hard Drive” publish service of Lightroom, it is feasible to “export” the images, but not in my wanted folder structure, because it is not possible to use the sources’ folder name as output folder name by option. It has to be specified manually each time, which is not very comfortable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/publish-hard-disk.png\" alt=\"Hard Disk Publish Service\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Plugin-to-the-rescue\"><a href=\"#Plugin-to-the-rescue\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Plugin to the rescue\"></a>Plugin to the rescue</h2><p>Jeffrey Friedl, who is in the Lightroom plugin business about a decade, offers two plugins, which can solve the problem easily:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/folder-publisher\">Jeffrey’s “<strong>Folder Publisher</strong>“ Lightroom Plugin</a><br>  Exports to disk in a folder hierarchy that mimics the folder hierarchy in your Lightroom catalog</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This one helps me not much, because my output folder would look like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight txt\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&lt;Dropbox&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  -&gt;  Photos</span><br><span class=\"line\">      -&gt;  Fotos</span><br><span class=\"line\">          -&gt; &lt;Year&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\">              -&gt;  &lt;Year&gt;-&lt;Month&gt; &lt;Eventname&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><a href=\"http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/collection-publisher\">Jeffrey’s “<strong>Collection Publisher</strong>” Lightroom Plugin</a><br>Exports to local disk in a folder hierarchy that mimics the collection hierarchy you build within Lightroom</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Besides the commonality of defining a root folder, where the files are exported to, Jeffrey’s plugin has much more options to improve the export.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/collection-publisher.png\" alt=\"Collection Publisher\"></p>\n<p>As the main feature, you can create collections within the plugin to define the export targets:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/collection-publisher-create.png\" alt=\"Create Collection\"></p>\n<p>In the options of these collections, you can set several templates (variables) to let the plugin name the export subfolder automatically:  </p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/collection-publisher-options.png\" alt=\"Collection Options\"></p>\n<p>By using <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/help/photo-collections.html#work_with_smart_collections\">Smart Collections</a> you don’t even need to drag &amp; drop your images to publish to the publish collection.
