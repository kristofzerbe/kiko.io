It has several categories to find the right music to play, a context-sensitive search, a folder view, is able to import and manage playlists, a light and dark mode and translations into currently 28 languages. It can update your collection automatically from several folders, has two player modes and is incredibly fast.</p>\n<p>The keep long story short … I fell in love on <strong>Dopamine</strong>‘s simple beauty and it is now my favourite player on Windows 10! </p>\n<p>Thanks Raphaël…</p>\n","_path":"post/Dopamine-How-Software-should-be/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Dopamine-How-Software-should-be/","_id":"clozu2011000qppovazszgpvh"}}
