But they should not be too small either and the arrangement is also important to consider.</p>\n<p>For this purpose I have so far used my <a href=\"/post/Hexo-Tag-Plugin-Collection/#image-slide\">Image Slider Tag Plugin</a>, but with this you only ever see one of the images and have to scroll through the rest horizontally. A medium sized overview, best in the so called masonry format, where images are automatically assembled based on their size on a limited area, would be much better for some cases. There are a variety of CSS or JavaScript solutions out there on the net, but the most suitable for me was <a href=\"http://macyjs.com/\"><strong>Macy.js</strong></a> … and how I integrated it into my Hexo environment is what I want to describe here.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clm1uxfo8003jk3ol3b6jhl40"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","_id":"clm1uxfo7003ik3ola3r0hawh"},{"name":"GitHub","_id":"clm1uxfoc003sk3olhuxn0pin"},{"name":"Plugin","_id":"clm1uxfph0067k3olgrj36hv8"}],"_path":"post/Image-Masonry-Tag-Plugin-for-Hexo/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Image-Masonry-Tag-Plugin-for-Hexo/","_id":"clm1uxfmt0034k3ol8hg91ru4"},{"title":"Convert HTML into Plain Text in Hexo","date":"2023-08-31T19:58:36.000Z","description":"<p>Hexo, on which this blog is based, is a Static Site Generator (SSG) that generates a whole structure of HTML files from individual Markdown files in which the articles were written. Besides the actual posts, also overview pages like the archives and others. For the latter, however, it only needs an excerpt from the actual article, which Hexo automatically creates from the initially generated HTML content and which is also available as HTML.</p>\n<p>For my <a href=\"/post/Show-pages-meta-data-JSON-LD-in-Bottom-Sheet/\" title=\"Show pages meta data (JSON-LD) in Bottom Sheet\">Page Meta dialog</a>, however, I recently needed the excerpt as plain text to make it easier to transfer it manually to a Mastodon post, for example. My initial attempts to extract the plain text from the original Markdown turned out to be quite difficult, because in Hexo not only Markdown is used, but also special <a href=\"https://hexo.io/docs/tag-plugins\">Tag Plugins</a> in Nunjucks format and of course plain HTML.

Already three years ago (omg … really?) I described in an article how to do this with Hexo: <a href=\"/post/Automatic-Header-Images-in-Hexo/\" title=\"Automatic Header Images in Hexo\">Automatic Header Images in Hexo</a>.</p>\n<p>To keep it short, I use a pool folder for this, in which I keep in subfolders next to a <code>meta.txt</code>, for the title of the image and an external url on 500px for interactions to the image, three variants that I need for a new post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mobile.jpg (width 480px)</li>\n<li>tablet.jpg (width 768px)</li>\n<li>normal.jpg (width 1280px)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only piece of the puzzle that was still missing was the automatic generation of these three image variants and the meta file based on a selected photo that I want to add to the pool of available header images. So far it was fun to generate the header images manually either on the desktop or on the smartphone, but it really doesn’t have to be. My goal now was to write a script where I just throw a selected photo into a folder and the NodeJS script does the rest.</p>\n<p>My photo workflow is based on Adobe Lightroom Classic and one of the steps is to give a title to the good ones I use here as well. So the script had to include four steps when iterating over the inbound folder’s JPG files:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>create new pool folder</li>\n<li>read meta data (IPTC -&gt; title) and write it to meta.txt</li>\n<li>create the three image variants</li>\n<li>delete the processed image from the inbound folder</li>\n</ol>","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","_id":"clm1uxfoa003nk3olfzal9dve"}],"tags":[{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clm1uxfqc007vk3olapx4b6zj"},{"name":"Node.js","_id":"clm1uxfrh00adk3ol0pfi5ero"}],"_path":"post/Pool-Photo-Generator/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Pool-Photo-Generator/","_id":"clm1uxfmw003ak3ol68s89q9g"},{"title":"SVWW vs. Karlsruhe @ 2023-08-18","date":"2023-08-19T16:33:00.000Z","description":"<p>I already had my season ticket on the first matchday of the 2023&#x2F;2024 season, but was unable to get into the stadium for the team’s first home game and thus missed the 1:1 draw against <strong>Magdeburg</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"First-Impressions\"><a href=\"#First-Impressions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"First Impressions\"></a>First Impressions</h2><p>So, Friday was my premiere on my season seat West 3, Row 1, Seat 1.
