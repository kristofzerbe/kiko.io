However, there is one catch, that has annoyed me ever since:<br>I find an interesting link in the Mastodon WebApp, for example, and tap on it. What opens, however, is the WebView integrated in Android and not my standard Chrome browser, in which the bookmarklet would be available. So, for links that I want to store, I always have to open the WebView menu and select “Open in Chrome Browser”. I cannot use the general SHARE menu. At least not so far … :)</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"cloygbj520040kqopcks569xk"}],"tags":[{"name":"Trello","_id":"cloygbj5o005lkqope64jb9oq"},{"name":"Android","_id":"cloygbj6m0088kqop1033hs7h"}],"_path":"post/Add-Link-to-Trello-on-Android-via-Share-Menu/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Add-Link-to-Trello-on-Android-via-Share-Menu/","_id":"cloygbj3g002vkqop877k5evn"},{"title":"Experimenting with the font LEXEND","date":"2023-11-12T17:24:00.000Z","description":"<p>A few weeks ago, a blog entry (I can’t remember which one) drew my attention to a font called <a href=\"https://www.lexend.com/\"><strong>LEXEND</strong></a>.

After my <a href=\"/post/SGE-vs-HJK-2023-10-26/\" title=\"SGE vs. HJK @ 2023-10-26\">little excursion into the Europa Conference League</a>, my team from <strong>SV Wehen Wiesbaden</strong> was called upon again on Sunday and with them the fans in the stadium. On the one hand because it was raining (and that is sometimes no fun in the front row) and on the other hand because the boys had won the last away game in Osnabrück and now had the opportunity to temporarily establish themselves in the midfield of the 2. Bundesliga. Another win was needed against an opponent from <strong>Rostock</strong> who, after a good start at the beginning of the season, had lost the last 6 games!</p>\n<p>Since I have no chance to park my car anywhere at the stadium, I have already planned before the season to always go there with the scooter, which is a pure pleasure in the summer. With 10 degrees and light rain it was diemal but rather suboptimal conditions. But anyway…</p>\n<p>I had expected that a lot of police, water cannon and other executive equipment would be on site, as it was already the case at the Schalke game, because the Hansa fans have a pretty bad reputation … But no. Not particularly many Rostockers have taken on the 700 kilometer journey and so the opposing stand was only half full and the police relaxed.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"cloygbj7b00a6kqop13cwbxji"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"cloygbj9400eykqop5y6w6znf"},{"name":"2.
