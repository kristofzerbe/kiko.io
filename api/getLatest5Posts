In this small town, where practically everybody knows everybody, there is a small football club called SV Wehen since 1926 and some of my schoolmates played there in their youth.</p>\n<p>This small club played only a regional role at all until 1979, when a local entrepreneur put money into the club and it worked its way up one league after the other over the years:</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"clli71kyp0091k1onfwv74l3x"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"clli71l0w00d3k1on4hv7du1p"}],"_path":"post/My-Hometown-My-Club/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/My-Hometown-My-Club/","_id":"clli71kuu0034k1on74bd7mef"},{"title":"CONTINUE READING Link & Auto Scrolling on the called page","date":"2023-07-29T14:14:35.000Z","description":"<p>On the home page of a blog or other text-heavy site with regular new articles, it is often advisable not to display the entire text of the article, but a more or less large excerpt and a READ MORE or CONTINUE READING link that leads to the rest of the article, usually a stand-alone article page. This allows the user to quickly get a picture of, say, the last dozen posts when he comes here to browse your texts.</p>\n<p>However, it is somewhat unpleasant if you as the author decide to display a larger excerpt after all, and the user lands at the top of the called page after clicking on the MORE link and first has to scroll&#x2F;navigate to the right place until he can resume reading. This destroys his reading flow. It is better to take the user directly to the page where the MORE link interrupted the text on the home page.</p>\n<p>With a hash and some JavaScript this is done so quickly, that I wonder why I haven’t implemented this on my own blog already :)</p>","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","_id":"clli71kwb003ik1on92rd7b8y"}],"tags":[{"name":"UI","_id":"clli71l0400bmk1on2nibhgzk"},{"name":"Usability","_id":"clli71l0o00cjk1on1ydf14xw"}],"_path":"post/CONTINUE-READING-Link-Auto-Scrolling-on-the-called-page/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/CONTINUE-READING-Link-Auto-Scrolling-on-the-called-page/","_id":"clli71kun002uk1on4xw9edsd"},{"title":"Extension of downupPopup: Back Button, Escape Key & More","date":"2023-07-04T11:07:38.000Z","description":"<p>I recently introduced a Bottom Sheet dialog on this blog to display a page’s metadata (<a href=\"javascript:dialog.pageMeta()\">like this</a>), using Ali Dincer’s work: <a href=\"https://downuppopupjs.dincerali.com/\"><strong>downupPopup</strong></a>.
