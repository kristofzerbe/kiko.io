Already three years ago (omg … really?) I described in an article how to do this with Hexo: <a href=\"/post/Automatic-Header-Images-in-Hexo/\" title=\"Automatic Header Images in Hexo\">Automatic Header Images in Hexo</a>.</p>\n<p>To keep it short, I use a pool folder for this, in which I keep in subfolders next to a <code>meta.txt</code>, for the title of the image and an external url on 500px for interactions to the image, three variants that I need for a new post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mobile.jpg (width 480px)</li>\n<li>tablet.jpg (width 768px)</li>\n<li>normal.jpg (width 1280px)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only piece of the puzzle that was still missing was the automatic generation of these three image variants and the meta file based on a selected photo that I want to add to the pool of available header images. So far it was fun to generate the header images manually either on the desktop or on the smartphone, but it really doesn’t have to be. My goal now was to write a script where I just throw a selected photo into a folder and the NodeJS script does the rest.</p>\n<p>My photo workflow is based on Adobe Lightroom Classic and one of the steps is to give a title to the good ones I use here as well. So the script had to include four steps when iterating over the inbound folder’s JPG files:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>create new pool folder</li>\n<li>read meta data (IPTC -&gt; title) and write it to meta.txt</li>\n<li>create the three image variants</li>\n<li>delete the processed image from the inbound folder</li>\n</ol>","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","_id":"cllz44ybd003nkkoi5b383ehz"}],"tags":[{"name":"Imaging","_id":"cllz44ycp007tkkoi19iibto1"},{"name":"Node.js","_id":"cllz44yde00a8kkoihm3me1l1"}],"_path":"post/Pool-Photo-Generator/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Pool-Photo-Generator/","_id":"cllz44ya70037kkoi9dbmbgna"},{"title":"SVWW vs. Karlsruhe @ 2023-08-18","date":"2023-08-19T16:33:00.000Z","description":"<p>I already had my season ticket on the first matchday of the 2023&#x2F;2024 season, but was unable to get into the stadium for the team’s first home game and thus missed the 1:1 draw against <strong>Magdeburg</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"First-Impressions\"><a href=\"#First-Impressions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"First Impressions\"></a>First Impressions</h2><p>So, Friday was my premiere on my season seat West 3, Row 1, Seat 1.

This allows the user to quickly get a picture of, say, the last dozen posts when he comes here to browse your texts.</p>\n<p>However, it is somewhat unpleasant if you as the author decide to display a larger excerpt after all, and the user lands at the top of the called page after clicking on the MORE link and first has to scroll&#x2F;navigate to the right place until he can resume reading. This destroys his reading flow. It is better to take the user directly to the page where the MORE link interrupted the text on the home page.</p>\n<p>With a hash and some JavaScript this is done so quickly, that I wonder why I haven’t implemented this on my own blog already :)</p>","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","_id":"cllz44ybd003nkkoi5b383ehz"}],"tags":[{"name":"UI","_id":"cllz44yb9003dkkoi10n0711v"},{"name":"Usability","_id":"cllz44yea00cpkkoi6pdggb5y"}],"_path":"post/CONTINUE-READING-Link-Auto-Scrolling-on-the-called-page/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/CONTINUE-READING-Link-Auto-Scrolling-on-the-called-page/","_id":"cllz44ya3002wkkoib29cdrev"},{"title":"Extension of downupPopup: Back Button, Escape Key & More","date":"2023-07-04T11:07:38.000Z","description":"<p>I recently introduced a Bottom Sheet dialog on this blog to display a page’s metadata (<a href=\"javascript:dialog.pageMeta()\">like this</a>), using Ali Dincer’s work: <a href=\"https://downuppopupjs.dincerali.com/\"><strong>downupPopup</strong></a>.
