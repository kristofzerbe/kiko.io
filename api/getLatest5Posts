Thoughts, experiences, self-dramatizations or even texts or posts from other people. This is especially true for microblogging on (formerly) Twitter and (today) Mastodon. To make this easy, the platforms often offer a SHARE endpoint (URL), such as the famous</p>\n<p><code>http://www.twitter.com/share?text=My impossible thoughts on X</code></p>\n<p>… or any dirt buttons to collect user data.</p>\n<p>A few months after the groundbreaking of Mastodon 2016, such a feature was also <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/442\">discussed and implemented</a> on GitHub and out came: </p>\n<p><code>https://&lt;your-instance&gt;/share&amp;text=My benevolent thoughts on the Fediverse</code></p>\n<p>But … where Twitter had it easy due to its central structure (twitter.com … period.), we Mastodon users all fidget around on <strong>different instances</strong>, i.e. each instance has its own <code>/SHARE</code> endpoint and so it’s a bit harder to stick a share button on your own blog, because you have to ask the user where he lives.</p>\n<p>Of course, online services like <a href=\"https://toot.kytta.dev/\">toot.kytta.dev</a>, <a href=\"https://s2f.kytta.dev/\">s2f.kytta.dev</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodonshare.com/\">mastodonshare.com</a> sprouted immediately, but also the button providers expanded their portfolio or new ones were launched, like <a href=\"https://shareon.js.org/\">shareon.js.org</a>, <a href=\"https://share-on-mastodon.social/\">share-on-mastodon.social</a>, <a href=\"https://www.shareaholic.com/website-tools/social-share-buttons/mastodon/\">shareaholic.com</a>.</p>\n<p>But seriously … does it take an external service to ask the user for an instance name and redirect him to an URL (and run the risk of falling victim to data collection mania)? Because that’s all it is. All of the above do it exactly that way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Mastodon-Share-Bottom-Sheet-Dialog/indieweb-social-share.png\" alt=\"indieweb.social Share\"></p>\n<p>So we come to the ready-made developer solutions e.g. How-To tutorials.

From time to time I contribute small things to GitHub projects and sometimes get confused with all the commands. <code>Fork</code>, <code>Clone</code>, <code>Commit</code>, <code>Stage</code>, <code>Pull Request</code> … all things that mean something to me, but that I certainly haven’t internalized. And so it happens that I sometimes mess up a pull request or something similar.</p>\n<p>Sure, my blog here also lives in GitHub, both in terms of source control and hosting on GitHub Pages, but here I’m the only one committing. No issues, no branches, no pull requests or anything else. I change something, hit commit and I’m done.</p>\n<p>Another point I can’t dismiss: I’m a Windows guy who likes to click buttons. The command line is not for me at all.<br><em>What was the name of the parameter? Do I have to write <code>--param=xxx</code> or <code>/param:xxx</code> … damn where is the button?</em><br>My brain is probably too small for that.</p>\n<p>Visual Studio Code is a big help there … it has buttons! But that doesn’t save me when it comes to Git, because you have to know in which order to press which of these buttons!</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"cln545yki003sjsop1007fz0j"}],"tags":[{"name":"VS Code","_id":"cln545ykk003xjsopgwpl2bd0"},{"name":"Publishing","_id":"cln545ylk006ejsop3qbi52dj"},{"name":"Git/GitHub","_id":"cln545yof00dejsopf5tgf47y"}],"_path":"post/Contribute-with-Conventional-Commits/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Contribute-with-Conventional-Commits/","_id":"cln545yip002xjsopc09a0ht0"},{"title":"Discoveries #26 - JavaScript HowTo's","date":"2023-09-12T05:53:45.000Z","description":"<p>Over time, everyone accumulates links somewhere about procedures that one has not yet internalized.

We got six additional tickets for the game in time and with a crowd of 11,003 fans, this was also urgently necessary. The stadium (12,566 standing and seated) was full to the roof. Only one of three blocks of the guests was empty. Some Schalke fans seem to have expected nothing from the game in Wiesbaden. No wonder after table position 15 after the last match day.</p>\n<p>Since season ticket holders get into the stadium a little faster and my friends sat a little scattered in different blocks, I lost sight of them at some point, but that was not tragic, because they had fun.</p>\n<p>To my delight, the booth operators, who I had to criticize last time, actually did a better job today. Two cash registers: one for cash and another for card&#x2F;smartphone&#x2F;watch payers. The sale of beer and bratwurst went much more quickly, only I had to stand in line a bit at the fan shop, because I was not yet recognizable as a fan: it had to get a cap and a jersey, of course, finally.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"cln545yn0009pjsop8uo9a7jd"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"cln545yoz00e6jsopa1hdesag"},{"name":"2.
