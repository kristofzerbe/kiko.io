Works also everything quite well … only the verification of the generated data was a bit cumbersome:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open DevTools for a page in Chrome.</li>\n<li>Search in the HEAD of the source code for the included script (“application&#x2F;ld+json”)</li>\n<li>Copy out JSON-LD code</li>\n<li>Format JSON into VS code … and check</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nothing for now and simply impossible on the smartphone, even if there would be a reasonable Chrome extension for displaying JSON-LD data, but it does not exist (yet). Another problem was that I use automatically generated Socal Media images for my articles, which are included in the JSON-LD, but do not appear anywhere in the page and thus were beyond my control. I simply wanted to display all the generated stuff.</p>\n<p>Since I’ve been a fan of the so-called bottom sheets since the first version of Google’s Material Design, I imagined a script that grabs the code embedded in the page and pushes a panel with all the data visualized there into the page from the bottom … and the whole act was easier than I thought.</p>","categories":[{"name":"UI/UX","_id":"clizsijae0048jdoietv44bos"}],"tags":[{"name":"Publishing","_id":"clizsijaw005ojdoifrd3cntv"},{"name":"JSON-LD","_id":"clizsijdo00ckjdoi0z3cdo0s"},{"name":"Meta","_id":"clizsijdp00cnjdoi6z7bfjxm"}],"_path":"post/Show-pages-meta-data-JSON-LD-in-Bottom-Sheet/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Show-pages-meta-data-JSON-LD-in-Bottom-Sheet/","_id":"clizsij8m0032jdoi2p044scv"},{"title":"Top 10 Pens of Jon Kantner","date":"2023-05-08T13:34:15.000Z","description":"<p>A while ago I posted my <a href=\"/post/Favourite-Pens-of-2022/\" title=\"Favourite Pens of 2022\">favourite pens of 2022</a>.
