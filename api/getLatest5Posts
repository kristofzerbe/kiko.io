Magath, Hrubesch, Keegan were my sporting heroes back then. This was certainly also related to the fact that the club was one of the best in Europe in the early 80s. Two championships, European Cup victory and a strong team left an impression on me. As the last founding member of the 1. Bundesliga, however, it was always in danger of relegation in the last 10 years and then really relegated to the 2. Bundesliga in 2018 after 55 years. What followed were sad attempts to climb back up. Always so close that the saying prevailed: “How can you tell that it’s springtime in Germany? The trees are sprouting and HSV is fucking up the promotion!”</p>\n<p>In my first post in this series, I described how my hometown club from Wiesbaden made it into the 2. Bundeliga and this particular home game this weekend has a special appeal for me, of course. The favorite club from my youth against the one from my present. My Wehen Wiesbaden against my HSV.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"clnj3spug009sjaotglad2t3t"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"clnj3spvu00ecjaot2hob2mlr"},{"name":"2.

As a casual photographer, I mostly use my vacation and weekend trips to take my Nikon for a walk and let its chip card glow. My better half is constantly wondering why I stopped there or here again, even if she likes the results afterwards. The point is that I am a color-and-shape junkie. Of course I also do landscapes and portraits, but the details of things have done it to me the most. Colors &amp; Shapes …</p>\n<p>In July I was for a few days with friends on a finca in the south of Mallorca and of course I used every opportunity to stick my lens everywhere where there were interesting details to be expected. I don’t know if it had anything to do with the heat, but most of the motifs have a very earthy touch. I probably wanted to stay somewhere underground all the time, because 40 degrees Celsius in the shade was then also a bit too much for me.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Photo","_id":"clnj3spsw004ujaot07yfhwlz"}],"tags":[{"name":"Publishing","_id":"clnj3sptf006gjaot9izma9wz"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clnj3sptx0086jaotdze9ac68"}],"_path":"post/Majorcan-Details/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Majorcan-Details/","_id":"clnj3sprd0039jaotaesj67za"},{"title":"Mastodon Share Bottom Sheet Dialog","date":"2023-09-28T07:57:54.000Z","description":"<p>Social media thrives on sharing. Thoughts, experiences, self-dramatizations or even texts or posts from other people. This is especially true for microblogging on (formerly) Twitter and (today) Mastodon. To make this easy, the platforms often offer a SHARE endpoint (URL), such as the famous</p>\n<p><code>http://www.twitter.com/share?text=My impossible thoughts on X</code></p>\n<p>… or any dirt buttons to collect user data.</p>\n<p>A few months after the groundbreaking of Mastodon 2016, such a feature was also <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/442\">discussed and implemented</a> on GitHub and out came: </p>\n<p><code>https://&lt;your-instance&gt;/share&amp;text=My benevolent thoughts on the Fediverse</code></p>\n<p>But … where Twitter had it easy due to its central structure (twitter.com … period.), we Mastodon users all fidget around on <strong>different instances</strong>, i.e. each instance has its own <code>/SHARE</code> endpoint and so it’s a bit harder to stick a share button on your own blog, because you have to ask the user where he lives.</p>\n<p>Of course, online services like <a href=\"https://toot.kytta.dev/\">toot.kytta.dev</a>, <a href=\"https://s2f.kytta.dev/\">s2f.kytta.dev</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodonshare.com/\">mastodonshare.com</a> sprouted immediately, but also the button providers expanded their portfolio or new ones were launched, like <a href=\"https://shareon.js.org/\">shareon.js.org</a>, <a href=\"https://share-on-mastodon.social/\">share-on-mastodon.social</a>, <a href=\"https://www.shareaholic.com/website-tools/social-share-buttons/mastodon/\">shareaholic.com</a>.</p>\n<p>But seriously … does it take an external service to ask the user for an instance name and redirect him to an URL (and run the risk of falling victim to data collection mania)? Because that’s all it is. All of the above do it exactly that way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Mastodon-Share-Bottom-Sheet-Dialog/indieweb-social-share.png\" alt=\"indieweb.social Share\"></p>\n<p>So we come to the ready-made developer solutions e.g. How-To tutorials.

From time to time I contribute small things to GitHub projects and sometimes get confused with all the commands. <code>Fork</code>, <code>Clone</code>, <code>Commit</code>, <code>Stage</code>, <code>Pull Request</code> … all things that mean something to me, but that I certainly haven’t internalized. And so it happens that I sometimes mess up a pull request or something similar.</p>\n<p>Sure, my blog here also lives in GitHub, both in terms of source control and hosting on GitHub Pages, but here I’m the only one committing. No issues, no branches, no pull requests or anything else. I change something, hit commit and I’m done.</p>\n<p>Another point I can’t dismiss: I’m a Windows guy who likes to click buttons. The command line is not for me at all.<br><em>What was the name of the parameter? Do I have to write <code>--param=xxx</code> or <code>/param:xxx</code> … damn where is the button?</em><br>My brain is probably too small for that.</p>\n<p>Visual Studio Code is a big help there … it has buttons!
