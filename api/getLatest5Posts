In this article, the author also went into the scientific background of the font, which was developed to simplify reading and thus support those with reading difficulties. The website <a href=\"https://www.lexend.com/\">lexend.com</a>, operated by The Lexend Group, therefore also advertises the font with all kinds of reading statistics, although it is open source and is also freely available via Google Fonts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Experimenting-with-the-font-LEXEND/lexend.png\" alt=\"Lexend\"></p>\n<p>I simply liked the font style and wanted to try it out on this blog, which has always used the <a href=\"https://www.opensans.com/\">Open Sans</a> font.

After my <a href=\"/post/SGE-vs-HJK-2023-10-26/\" title=\"SGE vs. HJK @ 2023-10-26\">little excursion into the Europa Conference League</a>, my team from <strong>SV Wehen Wiesbaden</strong> was called upon again on Sunday and with them the fans in the stadium. On the one hand because it was raining (and that is sometimes no fun in the front row) and on the other hand because the boys had won the last away game in Osnabrück and now had the opportunity to temporarily establish themselves in the midfield of the 2. Bundesliga. Another win was needed against an opponent from <strong>Rostock</strong> who, after a good start at the beginning of the season, had lost the last 6 games!</p>\n<p>Since I have no chance to park my car anywhere at the stadium, I have already planned before the season to always go there with the scooter, which is a pure pleasure in the summer. With 10 degrees and light rain it was diemal but rather suboptimal conditions. But anyway…</p>\n<p>I had expected that a lot of police, water cannon and other executive equipment would be on site, as it was already the case at the Schalke game, because the Hansa fans have a pretty bad reputation … But no. Not particularly many Rostockers have taken on the 700 kilometer journey and so the opposing stand was only half full and the police relaxed.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"clowtnrz100a3mjn0ds520b4f"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"clowtns0e00eumjn07cj1f1lc"},{"name":"2.

In the Rhine-Main area, the Frankfurt club is either hated or loved by the people, because its fan base is a bit more aggressive, i.e. they are disreputable and with them the club.
