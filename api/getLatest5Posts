As a casual photographer, I mostly use my vacation and weekend trips to take my Nikon for a walk and let its chip card glow. My better half is constantly wondering why I stopped there or here again, even if she likes the results afterwards. The point is that I am a color-and-shape junkie. Of course I also do landscapes and portraits, but the details of things have done it to me the most. Colors &amp; Shapes …</p>\n<p>In July I was for a few days with friends on a finca in the south of Mallorca and of course I used every opportunity to stick my lens everywhere where there were interesting details to be expected. I don’t know if it had anything to do with the heat, but most of the motifs have a very earthy touch. I probably wanted to stay somewhere underground all the time, because 40 degrees Celsius in the shade was then also a bit too much for me.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Photo","_id":"clnc0b150004tkcofbx8zfdmn"}],"tags":[{"name":"Publishing","_id":"clnc0b15o006fkcoffssq9ocg"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clnc0b16e0085kcoff9jk5o7k"}],"_path":"post/Majorcan-Details/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Majorcan-Details/","_id":"clnc0b12x0039kcofhwgh8dbp"},{"title":"Mastodon Share Bottom Sheet Dialog","date":"2023-09-28T07:57:54.000Z","description":"<p>Social media thrives on sharing. Thoughts, experiences, self-dramatizations or even texts or posts from other people. This is especially true for microblogging on (formerly) Twitter and (today) Mastodon. To make this easy, the platforms often offer a SHARE endpoint (URL), such as the famous</p>\n<p><code>http://www.twitter.com/share?text=My impossible thoughts on X</code></p>\n<p>… or any dirt buttons to collect user data.</p>\n<p>A few months after the groundbreaking of Mastodon 2016, such a feature was also <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/442\">discussed and implemented</a> on GitHub and out came: </p>\n<p><code>https://&lt;your-instance&gt;/share&amp;text=My benevolent thoughts on the Fediverse</code></p>\n<p>But … where Twitter had it easy due to its central structure (twitter.com … period.), we Mastodon users all fidget around on <strong>different instances</strong>, i.e. each instance has its own <code>/SHARE</code> endpoint and so it’s a bit harder to stick a share button on your own blog, because you have to ask the user where he lives.</p>\n<p>Of course, online services like <a href=\"https://toot.kytta.dev/\">toot.kytta.dev</a>, <a href=\"https://s2f.kytta.dev/\">s2f.kytta.dev</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodonshare.com/\">mastodonshare.com</a> sprouted immediately, but also the button providers expanded their portfolio or new ones were launched, like <a href=\"https://shareon.js.org/\">shareon.js.org</a>, <a href=\"https://share-on-mastodon.social/\">share-on-mastodon.social</a>, <a href=\"https://www.shareaholic.com/website-tools/social-share-buttons/mastodon/\">shareaholic.com</a>.</p>\n<p>But seriously … does it take an external service to ask the user for an instance name and redirect him to an URL (and run the risk of falling victim to data collection mania)? Because that’s all it is. All of the above do it exactly that way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Mastodon-Share-Bottom-Sheet-Dialog/indieweb-social-share.png\" alt=\"indieweb.social Share\"></p>\n<p>So we come to the ready-made developer solutions e.g. How-To tutorials.

From time to time I contribute small things to GitHub projects and sometimes get confused with all the commands. <code>Fork</code>, <code>Clone</code>, <code>Commit</code>, <code>Stage</code>, <code>Pull Request</code> … all things that mean something to me, but that I certainly haven’t internalized. And so it happens that I sometimes mess up a pull request or something similar.</p>\n<p>Sure, my blog here also lives in GitHub, both in terms of source control and hosting on GitHub Pages, but here I’m the only one committing. No issues, no branches, no pull requests or anything else. I change something, hit commit and I’m done.</p>\n<p>Another point I can’t dismiss: I’m a Windows guy who likes to click buttons. The command line is not for me at all.<br><em>What was the name of the parameter? Do I have to write <code>--param=xxx</code> or <code>/param:xxx</code> … damn where is the button?</em><br>My brain is probably too small for that.</p>\n<p>Visual Studio Code is a big help there … it has buttons! But that doesn’t save me when it comes to Git, because you have to know in which order to press which of these buttons!</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clnc0b14k003tkcof9jyxa3zt"}],"tags":[{"name":"VS Code","_id":"clnc0b14m003ykcof1sh8hb23"},{"name":"Publishing","_id":"clnc0b15o006fkcoffssq9ocg"},{"name":"Git/GitHub","_id":"clnc0b18m00dfkcof7kmh1wjd"}],"_path":"post/Contribute-with-Conventional-Commits/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Contribute-with-Conventional-Commits/","_id":"clnc0b12r002xkcof6wuf4f4w"},{"title":"Discoveries #26 - JavaScript HowTo's","date":"2023-09-12T05:53:45.000Z","description":"<p>Over time, everyone accumulates links somewhere about procedures that one has not yet internalized.
