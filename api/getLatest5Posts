We got six additional tickets for the game in time and with a crowd of 11,003 fans, this was also urgently necessary. The stadium (12,566 standing and seated) was full to the roof. Only one of three blocks of the guests was empty. Some Schalke fans seem to have expected nothing from the game in Wiesbaden. No wonder after table position 15 after the last match day.</p>\n<p>Since season ticket holders get into the stadium a little faster and my friends sat a little scattered in different blocks, I lost sight of them at some point, but that was not tragic, because they had fun.</p>\n<p>To my delight, the booth operators, who I had to criticize last time, actually did a better job today. Two cash registers: one for cash and another for card&#x2F;smartphone&#x2F;watch payers. The sale of beer and bratwurst went much more quickly, only I had to stand in line a bit at the fan shop, because I was not yet recognizable as a fan: it had to get a cap and a jersey, of course, finally.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"clmj4bs6k009ekcoxdhol6qz4"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"clmj4bs8900dokcox249f9lbb"},{"name":"2.
