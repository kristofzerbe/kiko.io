I don’t really know why I’ve never been there before, not even as a child, because the collection of cars and aeroplanes is quite unique in Germany. A dream for every boy, even if he’s not as young as he might think :)</p>\n<p>Built on the old site of an aircraft manufacturer, the 100-year-old hangars provide the perfect space for exhibiting large vehicles with wheels and wings. And exactly this can be found in Speyer: A large part for cars of all kinds and the outside area for aeroplanes and even ships. Even a spaceship, the Russian Space Shuttle alternative <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_programme\">Buran</a> can be seen there.</p>\n<p>Here are a few pictures of the car exhibition that I brought back from there and which will be used as post header images hero on kiko.io in the future …</p>","categories":[{"name":"Photo","_id":"clozz6k140054mwokaggegozr"}],"tags":[{"name":"Publishing","_id":"clozz6k1l006smwok2bi16c71"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clozz6k2n00b0mwokbgb58d1c"}],"_path":"post/Speyer-Automotive/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Speyer-Automotive/","_id":"clozz6k0s003vmwok9uxian8p"},{"title":"SVWW vs. Kaiserslautern @ 2023-11-12","date":"2023-11-15T13:12:00.000Z","description":"<div class=\"float-matchgrid\">\n      <img src=\"/images/logos/SV-Wehen-Wiesbaden.svg\" />\n      <span>2:1</span>\n      <img src=\"/images/logos/1-FC-Kaiserslautern.svg\" />\n    </div>\n  \n\n<p>Travelling by scooter in Germany in the middle of November is no fun. Just like on Sunday. Light rain at just under 9 degrees Celsius and quite a bit of wind. Brrr… but what can I do, there are no car parks at the arena. Not at all today, because it’s against Kaiserslautern, which is only about 100 kilometres away from Wiesbaden and therefore a lot of visitors are expected. It’s a kind of derby.</p>\n<p><strong>1. FC Kaiserslautern</strong> is one of the great traditional clubs in Germany, which has celebrated a total of 4 German Championships in its history, but has really lost momentum since its relegation to the 2. Bundesliga in 2006. Between 2018 and 2022, the team even only played in the 3rd division pf German football, but after their last year’s promotion, they are hoping to be promoted to the top division again soon. Recent results in the cup have shown that they have a strong team and it was to be feared that they would overrun Wehen Wiesbaden in their run, although their last league game was lost against Fürth.</p>\n<p>It was also rather uncomfortably cold in the stadium and I wondered once again how the young lads do it on the pitch in their shorts, especially the goalkeeper.</p>\n<p>But the fans created the right atmosphere. As expected, the entire guest stand was full. 12,100 spectators in total; a new season record. The SVWW fan block was also packed this time and the ultras had come up with a nice choreo with complete stand banners and red smoke (see photos).</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"clozz6k2g00a8mwok2jofa9or"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"clozz6k3q00f0mwok8m0973q6"},{"name":"2.

However, there is one catch, that has annoyed me ever since:<br>I find an interesting link in the Mastodon WebApp, for example, and tap on it. What opens, however, is the WebView integrated in Android and not my standard Chrome browser, in which the bookmarklet would be available. So, for links that I want to store, I always have to open the WebView menu and select “Open in Chrome Browser”. I cannot use the general SHARE menu. At least not so far … :)</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clozz6k0u0042mwokfx1g5s7r"}],"tags":[{"name":"Trello","_id":"clozz6k1a005nmwok50kz6s5t"},{"name":"Android","_id":"clozz6k2m00aymwokaua4dld4"}],"_path":"post/Add-Link-to-Trello-on-Android-via-Share-Menu/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Add-Link-to-Trello-on-Android-via-Share-Menu/","_id":"clozz6jzl002vmwok8zyr7s7t"},{"title":"Experimenting with the font LEXEND","date":"2023-11-12T17:24:00.000Z","description":"<p>A few weeks ago, a blog entry (I can’t remember which one) drew my attention to a font called <a href=\"https://www.lexend.com/\"><strong>LEXEND</strong></a>.

After my <a href=\"/post/SGE-vs-HJK-2023-10-26/\" title=\"SGE vs. HJK @ 2023-10-26\">little excursion into the Europa Conference League</a>, my team from <strong>SV Wehen Wiesbaden</strong> was called upon again on Sunday and with them the fans in the stadium. On the one hand because it was raining (and that is sometimes no fun in the front row) and on the other hand because the boys had won the last away game in Osnabrück and now had the opportunity to temporarily establish themselves in the midfield of the 2. Bundesliga. Another win was needed against an opponent from <strong>Rostock</strong> who, after a good start at the beginning of the season, had lost the last 6 games!</p>\n<p>Since I have no chance to park my car anywhere at the stadium, I have already planned before the season to always go there with the scooter, which is a pure pleasure in the summer. With 10 degrees and light rain it was diemal but rather suboptimal conditions. But anyway…</p>\n<p>I had expected that a lot of police, water cannon and other executive equipment would be on site, as it was already the case at the Schalke game, because the Hansa fans have a pretty bad reputation … But no. Not particularly many Rostockers have taken on the 700 kilometer journey and so the opposing stand was only half full and the police relaxed.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"clozz6k2g00a8mwok2jofa9or"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"clozz6k3q00f0mwok8m0973q6"},{"name":"2.
