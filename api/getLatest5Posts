Another problem was that I use automatically generated Socal Media images for my articles, which are included in the JSON-LD, but do not appear anywhere in the page and thus were beyond my control. I simply wanted to display all the generated stuff.</p>\n<p>Since I’ve been a fan of the so-called bottom sheets since the first version of Google’s Material Design, I imagined a script that grabs the code embedded in the page and pushes a panel with all the data visualized there into the page from the bottom … and the whole act was easier than I thought.</p>","categories":[{"name":"UI/UX","_id":"cljgxn5wa0048j2ox7vnvbrpk"}],"tags":[{"name":"Publishing","_id":"cljgxn5wp005oj2oxb15d3u4j"},{"name":"JSON-LD","_id":"cljgxn5yn00clj2ox033z6omg"},{"name":"Meta","_id":"cljgxn5yz00coj2ox9g58429m"}],"_path":"post/Show-pages-meta-data-JSON-LD-in-Bottom-Sheet/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Show-pages-meta-data-JSON-LD-in-Bottom-Sheet/","_id":"cljgxn5ve0032j2ox1va92rmm"},{"title":"Top 10 Pens of Jon Kantner","date":"2023-05-08T13:34:15.000Z","description":"<p>A while ago I posted my <a href=\"/post/Favourite-Pens-of-2022/\" title=\"Favourite Pens of 2022\">favourite pens of 2022</a>.
