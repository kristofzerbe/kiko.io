In my back there was now and then a comment like “Now RUN!” or “Go ahead. The goal is in THIS direction!”, but I could understand them, because our team hardly dared to cross the center line in the first half. I still don’t know the name of the nice lady next to me, but I will. She suffered today like many rather quietly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"The-Game\"><a href=\"#The-Game\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Game\"></a>The Game</h2><p>In the first half we were, as they say in the jargon “compact in defense”, which means nothing else, that no one dared to run forward with the ball. Except for once, when after about 20 minutes Kianz Froese, our Canadian striker, ran into the box on the left side at full gallop, but unfortunately missed the goal by a hair’s breadth. Damn! Our team let the opponent play and again straddled every ball off their feet.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t, however, that Schalke dominated the game. We carelessly let them just do it and the fans had their fun when they shot the ball into the clouds again after a lot of roaring and stomping. Funny.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the second half, this continued seamlessly, even if you noticed that the coach in the cabin must have yelled at one or the other and these were now somewhat more active … and suddenly the ball was in our net … <strong>0:1</strong>! What? How? A goal in the 54. minute for Schalke out of (almost) nothing! I have to watch that again on TV … :|</p>\n\n      <div class=\"image-masonry\" id=\"image-masonry-i04lwd\">\n        <div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Schalke-2023-09-02/PXL_20230902_104957617.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Schalke-2023-09-02/PXL_20230902_105327820.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Schalke-2023-09-02/PXL_20230902_105347190.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Schalke-2023-09-02/PXL_20230902_105548827.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Schalke-2023-09-02/PXL_20230902_105749100.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Schalke-2023-09-02/PXL_20230902_124411594.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Schalke-2023-09-02/PXL_20230902_111931000.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Schalke-2023-09-02/PXL_20230902_120730081.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Schalke-2023-09-02/PXL_20230902_125820397.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Schalke-2023-09-02/PXL_20230902_130050774.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n      </div>\n      <script>\n        let macy = new Macy({\n          container: '#image-masonry-i04lwd',\n          trueOrder: false,\n          waitForImages: false,\n          useOwnImageLoader: false,\n          debug: true,\n          mobileFirst: true,\n          columns: 2,\n          margin: {\n            y: 6,\n            x: 6\n          },\n          breakAt: {\n            980: {\n              margin: {\n                x: 8,\n                y: 8\n              },\n              columns: 3\n            },\n            768: 2,\n            640: 3\n          }\n        });\n      </script>\n    \n\n<p>After our guys had digested the shock, after 10 minutes or so, they began … yes indeed … to play football! Also because Kauczinski had replaced a few snoozers. In the last 20 minutes it went with steam on the opponents goal, but we ran slightly out of time. In the 90th minute, 6 minutes of injury time were displayed and it was almost hectic … kick and rush. With success! In the 95th minute it was <strong>1:1</strong>, thanks to the leg of <strong>Reinthaler</strong>, from which bounced a defensive attempt, and in the 97th almost 2:1 … huuuuh, damn close.</p>\n<p>Before the game I had bet on a 1:1 and was unfortunately&#x2F;fortunately right. <strong>It felt like a victory.</strong></p>\n<p>&#x21FE;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kicker.de/wiesbaden-gegen-schalke-2023-bundesliga-4861704/spielbericht\">Match report on kicker.de</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Today we are in 6th place in the table and I don’t really understand why the team was so anxious.
