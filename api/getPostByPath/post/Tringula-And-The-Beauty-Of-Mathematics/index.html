Due to the abstraction of the actual motif, such images are also very suitable as header images on websites, such as blogs, if the image should not distract from the actual content. Such an image has a great closeness to the original, but looks more like art.</p>\n<p>Besides PNG, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is also available as output format, which makes sense because SVG is an XML format and the polygons calculated by the program can also be written away directly as corresponding <code>polygon</code> entries as text. The generated SVG files are thereby smaller by a factor of 30, depending on the original, and thus fit in many places much better with tight bandwidths or used-up consumption limits on the Internet.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Using-Triangula-on-the-command-line\"><a href=\"#Using-Triangula-on-the-command-line\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Using Triangula on the command line\"></a>Using Triangula on the command line</h2><p>Ryan offers his program Triangula also as <a href=\"https://github.com/RH12503/Triangula-CLI/\">CLI version</a>, which is called via the command line. The process of triangulating is separated into two parts: First you create the desired abstraction of an original image via the parameter <code>run</code>, which is stored in a JSON file on the hard disk and in a second step you create either a PNG or an SVG as output file via <code>render</code> and the specification of the JSON file.</p>\n<p>Since the command line tool has the same options as the UI version, it is great for automating the processing of the images used when building a website, for example. It also makes it much easier to turn an entire folder of images into such artistic abstractions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Using-triangulated-images-as-placeholders-on-websites\"><a href=\"#Using-triangulated-images-as-placeholders-on-websites\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Using triangulated images as placeholders on websites\"></a>Using triangulated images as placeholders on websites</h2><p>Depending on how good the Internet connection is and how well the developers brain of a website has worked, it can take a while until the browser of the smartphone has loaded the x-megabyte header or illustration image to finally be able to display it. It gets really annoying when no space has been reserved on the website for the image beforehand and the text that you have started to read suddenly jumps away.</p>\n<p>In any case, the solution is to always use images that are as small as possible and adapted to the device, but they still have a certain file size if they are to look good. To prevent text jumping, nowadays one usually uses gray placeholders with or without loading bars to signal to the user that something will be displayed at this point shortly.</p>\n<p>Ryan has found an amazingly effective solution for this as well: <a href=\"https://github.com/RH12503/tip\">tip - Triagulated Placeholders</a> - creating the smallest possible triangulated images and blending them using JavaScript.</p>\n<p>The basis is a frontend, also written in Go, which uses the same algorithms as Triangula and with which the user can process several original images or an entire folder of photos at once via the interface.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Tringula-And-The-Beauty-Of-Mathematics/tip.png\" alt=\"Very simple but functional interface of the tool tip, also written in Go, for generating binary placeholders for web pages\"></p>\n<p>The output format from <strong>tip</strong> is not PNG or SVG, but a binary file, which consumes the least amount of memory of all technical possibilities.</p>\n<p>For comparison the generated file sizes of the example image with resolution 1024 x 660:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Image</th>\n<th>Size</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Original</td>\n<td>386 KB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Triangula PNG</td>\n<td>223 KB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Triangula SVG</td>\n<td>40,3 KB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>tip TRI</td>\n<td>3,03 KB</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>These files, with the extension TRI, are referenced by the web developer in the IMG tag of an image on a page in the <code>data-src</code> attribute, and a <strong>JavaScript</strong>, only 200 lines long, which is also included and delivered with the web page, takes care of immediately displaying this TRI file when the page is loaded and smoothly fading to the original image once it has been loaded. You can hardly make it more beautiful.</p>\n","_path":"post/Tringula-And-The-Beauty-Of-Mathematics/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Tringula-And-The-Beauty-Of-Mathematics/","_id":"cloyfzohf002oovpxfrz044yq"}}
