Her name is Bärbel and this time she was a bit more excited than normally. Well, the aim was to beat Kaiserslautern. Kaiserslautern! Every now and then she also started to grumble: about an opposing player or when things didn’t go fast enough forwards or when the ball was lost unnecessarily. Not nearly as blatant as the “gentlemen” behind us, who were swearing in one piece and indulging in football wisdom, but you could tell that the game was more important to her than others.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"The-Game\"><a href=\"#The-Game\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Game\"></a>The Game</h2><p>In the first half, the game was rather well balanced, even if you had the feeling that our team was the only ones playing. There was no sign of Kaiserlautern’s attacking drive. Up until the 39th minute, we had one chance to score, but the visitors hadn’t even had a shot on our goal. Nothing, nada, niente. But then the ball was in our net: <strong>0:1</strong>! A strange goal, because it didn’t look intentional. The ball just bounced at Ritter’s feet by chance and he simply took a shot. Goal. Damn…</p>\n\n      <div class=\"image-masonry\" id=\"image-masonry-dhpmqo\">\n        <div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Kaiserslautern-2023-11-12/PXL_20231112_120526904.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Kaiserslautern-2023-11-12/PXL_20231112_122110857.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Kaiserslautern-2023-11-12/PXL_20231112_122854839.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Kaiserslautern-2023-11-12/PXL_20231112_122739398.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Kaiserslautern-2023-11-12/PXL_20231112_122947255.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Kaiserslautern-2023-11-12/PXL_20231112_135210240.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Kaiserslautern-2023-11-12/PXL_20231112_141045409.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Kaiserslautern-2023-11-12/PXL_20231112_142300311.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Kaiserslautern-2023-11-12/PXL_20231112_142353462.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Kaiserslautern-2023-11-12/PXL_20231112_142646533.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Kaiserslautern-2023-11-12/PXL_20231112_142730319.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><div><img class=\"no-caption\" src=\"/post/SVWW-vs-Kaiserslautern-2023-11-12/PXL_20231112_142841643.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n      </div>\n      <script>\n        let macy_dhpmqo = new Macy({\n          container: '#image-masonry-dhpmqo',\n          trueOrder: false,\n          waitForImages: false,\n          useOwnImageLoader: false,\n          debug: true,\n          mobileFirst: true,\n          columns: 2,\n          margin: {\n            y: 6,\n            x: 6\n          },\n          breakAt: {\n            980: {\n              margin: {\n                x: 8,\n                y: 8\n              },\n              columns: 3\n            },\n            768: 2,\n            640: 3\n          }\n        });\n      </script>\n    \n\n<p>After the break, Kaiserslautern seemed to want to build on the goal. They were now playing football. And ours were probably angry at not having been rewarded for their efforts in the first half. The game became more lively, but we still had the better scenes … and after just 4 minutes, the visitors gave our <strong>Tijmen Goppel</strong> far too much time to aim and shoot just outside the penalty area and the ball was deflected into the goal by an opponent’s leg. <strong>1:1</strong>!</p>\n<p>In the 65th minute, things got curious again: Goppel was fouled and awarded a free kick about 20 metres from goal. Robin Heußer took it and his shot somehow hit the chest of <strong>Ivan Prtajin</strong> in the penalty area, from where the ball went into the goal. <strong>2:1</strong> … Game turned round!</p>\n<p>The last half hour was really nerve-wracking. We continued to play better, but the pressure increased and the game became noticeably faster. Shortly before the end, substitute <strong>John Iredale</strong> ran alone with the ball across half the pitch and everyone held their breath, but just before the goal he tried to round the last defender and he was just able to scoop the ball away. G… damn it!</p>\n<p>&#x21FE;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kicker.de/wiesbaden-gegen-klautern-2023-bundesliga-4861776/analyse\">Match report on kicker.de</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This was the fourth (!) game in a row that we have won and our position in the table looks correspondingly favourable again. Only three points behind the promotion places. Woohoo … but let’s not fool ourselves: There will be another losing streak in the future (as always in football) and 21 points are still not enough to keep us in the league, and that’s all that matters.</p>\n<p>Two away games are scheduled in the next three weeks, against <strong>Greuther Fürth</strong> and <strong>Holstein Kiel</strong>. On 8 December, we return to the Brita Arena against <strong>Eintracht Braunschweig</strong>, currently second last in the table. They should be beatable…</p>\n\n    <a href=\"https://www.kicker.de/2-bundesliga/tabelle\">\n        <img src=\"tabelle-23-11-12.png\" alt=\"Table 2. Liga, Sunday 12.
