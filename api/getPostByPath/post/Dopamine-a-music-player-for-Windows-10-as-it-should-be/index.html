Everything is limited to the most necessary, an accent color and a lot of white e.g. gray space, so that not only the ear feels comfortable with the music, but also the eye. And all this at a very good speed and nicely animated transitions from one view to another.</p>\n<p>Besides the basic ability to play MP3 files, the author has also included a rudimentary, but well-functioning editing function of the MP3 metadata. Furthermore, any star assignments or added lyrics are stored directly in the file and not just in the SQLite database behind it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Dopamine-a-music-player-for-Windows-10-as-it-should-be/dopamine2-edit.png\" alt=\"Dopamine 2.0.9 Edit MP3 Metadata\"></p>\n<p>However, Godart has also included a few useful things from the Featuritis department in its program. On the one hand, it downloads information from last.fm about the currently played artist and you can scrobble there if you like, and on the other hand, it scans some lyric collections for the lyrics, which unfortunately rarely works.</p>\n<p>Quite unique is one of the most recently added features: a blacklist! Yes, many an album of a favorite musician contains a track that he would have been better off sparing himself. Such pieces can now be specifically hidden, so that the musical enjoyment is not spoiled.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Further-development\"><a href=\"#Further-development\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Further development\"></a>Further development</h2><p>New releases of Dopamine 2 since version 2.0.8 are not as frequent as before, because the program is basically developed out and Raphaël only adds smaller features, translations and bugfixes. Instead, 4 years after the release of the first version two years ago, he has embarked on a completely new development with version 3. Where Dopamine up to version 2 was developed with Microsoft C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), the latest will be based on Electron, Angular and Typescript, i.e. packaged web technology (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) for all operating systems and not just Windows. Currently, Godart has reached Preview 10, which has by far not the same scope of the previous version, but is already running stable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Dopamine-a-music-player-for-Windows-10-as-it-should-be/dopamine3.png\" alt=\"Dopamine 3 under Electron\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Music-in-the-cloud\"><a href=\"#Music-in-the-cloud\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Music in the cloud\"></a>Music in the cloud</h2><p>If you’re on the go and have stored your music on a cloud service like Microsoft’s OneDrive, you might pay attention to the fact that on a device connected to it, the entire collection is not downloaded, but only selected parts in order to save local storage space. Microsoft makes it easy for users there: it displays all OneDrive files in Windows Explorer with 0 bytes of space used and only downloads them when they are accessed or when the user selects <em>Always keep on this device</em> in a folder’s context menu. This works quite beautifully with Dopamine 2. It, with support from C# and the operating system, simply ignores all those files that are not available on the disk in real terms when scanning the specified music folder. Dopamine 3, on the other hand, in which the scan must take place via Node.js and the <code>fs.readdir()</code> method, immediately triggers the download function of OneDrive and you unintentionally fill up your disk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Curiosity-on-the-side\"><a href=\"#Curiosity-on-the-side\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Curiosity on the side\"></a>Curiosity on the side</h2><p>Raphaël’s C#&#x2F;WPF solution weighs 76 MB when installed, 2.5 MB of it for the executable, the new Electron-based one under Windows, however, already 302 MB, with the EXE being a whopping 128 MB. If you take a look at the code base, this becomes even more obvious: while the Windows-only version comes along with 760 files, the new Electron version already contains 86,092 files in 7,948 folders with a total weight of almost one gigabyte after running <code>npm install</code>! Once again you can see that platform independence in the brave new Node.JS world is often bought with heavy weight. This is mainly due to the necessity (or the unkindness, depending on how you look at it) to drag along thousands of dependent libraries (dependencies), which occasionally only bring a string to a certain width or something similarly trivial. Not to mention the problems with depublicated or malware-infested dependencies, which have recently upset large parts of the community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Dopamine 2 is a really fantastic music player for Windows that simply outshines most others due to its simplicity and well-done interface. Let’s see if Godard manages to do something similar with version 3 and Electron. It’s a challenge, but he seems to be a full-blooded developer. Chapeau Raphaël…</p>\n","_path":"post/Dopamine-a-music-player-for-Windows-10-as-it-should-be/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Dopamine-a-music-player-for-Windows-10-as-it-should-be/","_id":"clj88jjl0002ik0p76l513xm6"}}
