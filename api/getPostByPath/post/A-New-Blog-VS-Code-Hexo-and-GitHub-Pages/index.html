To create an article use the command <code>hexo new post|draft &quot;My Title&quot;</code>. The title will be converted in a URL-encoded string and will be used as file name and url.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Meta-data\"><a href=\"#Meta-data\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Meta data\"></a>Meta data</h3><p>Every post&#x2F;draft starts with its header (so called <a href=\"https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter\">Front Matter</a>) to store some meta data, which describes the post, like <code>title</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>tags</code> or <code>categories</code>. This is used by Hexo to classify and arrange your post during the build.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Markdown\"><a href=\"#Markdown\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Markdown\"></a>Markdown</h3><p>Hexo posts&#x2F;drafts are written in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\">Markdown</a>. Good syntax reference are the <a href=\"https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/\">Markdown Guide</a> and the more detailed <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/p/hexo/wiki/markdown_syntax/\">Markdown Syntax Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Excerpt\"><a href=\"#Excerpt\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Excerpt\"></a>Excerpt</h3><p>Is is usual to show a short excerpt an the start page of a blog, to keep it compact and teasering the user to click on a READ MORE button. To achieve this, you just have to add following comment to your article. Everything above is the excerpt and everything below is only shown, when you enter the article:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- more --&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"Images\"><a href=\"#Images\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Images\"></a>Images</h3><p>Some articles will contain images to illustrate something and the question is, where should they be stored? Answer: In a folder beside the post&#x2F;draft, which has the same name as the article MD file. To get this, you have to activate the setting <code>post_asset_folder</code> in your <code>_config.yml</code>. Now this folder will be created automatically, when you add a new post&#x2F;draft.</p>\n<p>In your Markdown you reference your image with:</p>\n<pre><code>&#123;% asset_img image-1.png \"Test Image\" %&#125;\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"/post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/vscode-2.png\" alt=\"Reference Image\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Build\"><a href=\"#Build\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Build\"></a>Build</h2><p>Hexo is a website generator, so a build will generate the whole website in a special folder, which has to be published. This output folder can be configured in the <code>_config.yml</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>public_dir: public\n</code></pre>\n<p>To wipe the output folder, run the command:</p>\n<pre><code>hexo clean\n</code></pre>\n<p>To start the build, run:</p>\n<pre><code>hexo generate\n</code></pre>\n<p>To view the website via the build-in local Hexo server, run:</p>\n<pre><code>hexo server\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"Publishing\"><a href=\"#Publishing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Publishing\"></a>Publishing</h2><p>Most “complex” task was to publish the new blog on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a>. My first approach was to use my personal page, as I did with my single HTML file, but this didn’t work, because I wanted to store the whole project on GitHub and it is not possible to point a personal page to the subdirectory <strong>docs</strong> or use a different branch as <strong>master</strong>.</p>\n<p>The simple solution was to create a new repository, named after my my blog <strong>kiko.io</strong>, to store teh whole project and point the GitHub Page to the subdirectory <strong>docs</strong> in the settings of the repository.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/github-1.png\" alt=\"GitHub Settings\"></p>\n<p>By overriding the default publish folder of Hexo in <code>_config.yml</code> …</p>\n<pre><code>public_dir: docs\n</code></pre>\n<p>… everything was set up. Commit and Push via git and done.</p>\n<p>Hexo has its own deploying mechanism and it is advisable to disable it, by commenting out the Deployment section <code>_config.yml</code>.</p>\n<p>Next step was to use my own custom domain for the blog. To achieve this, the most easiest way is to create a text file named <code>CNAME</code> (without extension!) with the content of the domain in a single line and publish this file in the root of the docs folder. Github will recognize this file and do the setup automatically.</p>\n<p>To point the domain to GitHub, I had to create following <code>A</code> records in my domain providers DNS settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>185.199.108.153</li>\n<li>185.199.109.153</li>\n<li>185.199.110.153</li>\n<li>185.199.111.153</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last step was to enable <strong>Enforce HTTPS</strong> in the repositories settings.</p>\n","_path":"post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","_id":"clm1pwdqu000blkol4934a8rv"}}
