So … cloned the thing, looked for the source file, inserted the line … and googled how to submit the change on my repo clone as a pull request to the Elk project, and found this great tutorial on Medium from someone, with the name Supritha:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github-using-vs-code-f03db28308c4\">&gt;&gt;&gt; How to Create a Pull Request on GitHub using VS Code</a></p>\n<p>Fantastic. The pull request was a breeze. BUT … on the pull request page of Elk on GitHub the first check threw an error regarding <strong>Semantic Pull Request</strong>, with the message the title was wrong … what the heck?</p>\n<p>While I was reading the documentation (after the first attempt to change the title to something reasonable and another failure), one of the Elk developers <a href=\"https://github.com/userquin\">Joaquín</a> was so nice and corrected the title and pointed me to the very doc I was reading:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary\">&gt;&gt;&gt; Conventional Commits &lt;&lt;&lt;</a></strong></p>\n<p>Okay … I was already happy that nothing went wrong this time, but that was too early, as so often in IT ;)</p>\n<p>Here to read: <a href=\"https://github.com/elk-zone/elk/pull/2394\">fix(ui): Empty lines in posts from Pixelfed are doubled&#x2F;tripled (#2392)</a></p>\n<p>Since I am a structured person, I liked the commit message rules used by the Elk team, because they open up a space to make the commits easier to evaluate automatically afterwards. I think a great help for projects of this scale … currently 202 contributors!</p>\n<p>Actually I don’t have a Git project where the <strong>Convertional Commits</strong> would be useful, but for my future Me … READ THIS POST!</p>\n<p>(And for my employees, in case they read this: I have an idea that we should definitely establish soon … ;)</p>\n","_path":"post/Contribute-with-Conventional-Commits/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Contribute-with-Conventional-Commits/","_id":"clnzptacp002xohopgt0wav32"}}
