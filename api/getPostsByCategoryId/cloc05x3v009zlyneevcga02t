In this small town, where practically everybody knows everybody, there is a small football club called SV Wehen since 1926 and some of my schoolmates played there in their youth.</p>\n<p>This small club played only a regional role at all until 1979, when a local business man put money into the club and it worked its way up one league after the other over the years:</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"cloc05x3v009zlyneevcga02t"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"cloc05x5b00eplyne337i9y09"}],"_path":"post/My-Hometown-My-Club/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/My-Hometown-My-Club/","_id":"cloc05x0v003dlyne3q6xdcpy"},{"title":"SGE vs. HJK @ 2023-10-26","date":"2023-10-29T18:59:05.000Z","description":"<div class=\"float-matchgrid\">\n  <img src=\"/images/logos/Eintracht-Frankfurt.svg\" />\n  <span>6:0</span>\n  <img src=\"/images/logos/HJK-Helsinki.svg\" />\n</div>\n\n<p>My newly awakened love for German soccer reached a small peak last Thursday when my colleague Uli asked me, if I would like to go to the evening match of his favorite club <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eintracht_Frankfurt\"><strong>Eintracht Frankfurt</strong></a> against <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsingin_Jalkapalloklubi\"><strong>HJK Helsinki</strong></a> as part of the preliminary round of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League\">Europa Conference League</a>. He had come by a happy coincidence to two tickets. Of course! Let’s go!</p>\n<p>Now I’m not an Eintracht fan, by any means. In the Rhine-Main area, the Frankfurt club is either hated or loved by the people, because its fan base is a bit more aggressive, i.e. they are disreputable and with them the club. But I’ve never been to the <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldstadion\">Waldstadion</a> (as it used to be called) or the “Deutsche Bank Park” (as it’s called if you put money on the table), one of the big soccer arenas in Germany, where international matches and other big events are also held regularly.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"cloc05x3v009zlyneevcga02t"}],"tags":[{"name":"Eintracht","_id":"cloc05x5d00ezlynedde7f3uq"}],"_path":"post/SGE-vs-HJK-2023-10-26/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/SGE-vs-HJK-2023-10-26/","_id":"cloc05x0x003ilynebgr83ij4"},{"title":"SVWW vs. HSV @ 2023-10-07","date":"2023-10-07T15:46:04.000Z","description":"<div class=\"float-matchgrid\">\n  <img src=\"/images/logos/SV-Wehen-Wiesbaden.svg\" />\n  <span>1:1</span>\n  <img src=\"/images/logos/Hamburger-SV.svg\" />\n</div>\n\n<p>Since my youth I am a (small) fan of the <strong>Hamburger Sportverein (HSV)</strong>. Magath, Hrubesch, Keegan were my sporting heroes back then. This was certainly also related to the fact that the club was one of the best in Europe in the early 80s. Two championships, European Cup victory and a strong team left an impression on me. As the last founding member of the 1. Bundesliga, however, it was always in danger of relegation in the last 10 years and then really relegated to the 2. Bundesliga in 2018 after 55 years. What followed were sad attempts to climb back up. Always so close that the saying prevailed: “How can you tell that it’s springtime in Germany? The trees are sprouting and HSV is fucking up the promotion!”</p>\n<p>In my first post in this series, I described how my hometown club from Wiesbaden made it into the 2. Bundeliga and this particular home game this weekend has a special appeal for me, of course. The favorite club from my youth against the one from my present. My Wehen Wiesbaden against my HSV.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"cloc05x3v009zlyneevcga02t"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"cloc05x5b00eplyne337i9y09"},{"name":"2.

We got six additional tickets for the game in time and with a crowd of 11,003 fans, this was also urgently necessary. The stadium (12,566 standing and seated) was full to the roof. Only one of three blocks of the guests was empty. Some Schalke fans seem to have expected nothing from the game in Wiesbaden. No wonder after table position 15 after the last match day.</p>\n<p>Since season ticket holders get into the stadium a little faster and my friends sat a little scattered in different blocks, I lost sight of them at some point, but that was not tragic, because they had fun.</p>\n<p>To my delight, the booth operators, who I had to criticize last time, actually did a better job today. Two cash registers: one for cash and another for card&#x2F;smartphone&#x2F;watch payers. The sale of beer and bratwurst went much more quickly, only I had to stand in line a bit at the fan shop, because I was not yet recognizable as a fan: it had to get a cap and a jersey, of course, finally.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Football","_id":"cloc05x3v009zlyneevcga02t"}],"tags":[{"name":"SVWW","_id":"cloc05x5b00eplyne337i9y09"},{"name":"2.
