Especially when utilizing a bunch of libraries and frameworks, bundling is some sort of a must. The offer on bundlers and task runners is large on the web: <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">WebPack</a>, <a href=\"https://www.snowpack.dev/\">Snowpack</a>, <a href=\"https://browserify.org/\">Browserify</a>, <a href=\"https://parceljs.org/\">Parcel</a>, <a href=\"https://gruntjs.com/\">Grunt</a>, <a href=\"https://gulpjs.com/\">Gulp</a> and “DingDong” (just replace with the hotest new shit available).</p>\n<p>But, it is not always necessary to replace your complete building pipeline, when the new “DingDong” is hyped in the media. Brave old tools like <a href=\"https://gulpjs.com/\">Gulp</a> are doing their job pretty well … and you are able to integrate some more modern approaches on bundling JS, for example.</p>\n<p>I couple of months ago, while working on a private project, I became attentive to <a href=\"https://www.rollupjs.org/\">Rollup.js</a>, a next-generation JavaScript module bundler from Rich Harris, the author of Svelte. Rollup uses the new standardized format for code modules included in the ES6 revision of JavaScript and supports Tree-Shaking, which means that it analyzes all your ES6 <code>imports</code> statements and bundles only the code which is used. Pretty cool … but … it is a JavaScript bundler only and there are no plugins for Gulp, my favourite task runner.</p>\n<p>In this article I will show you, how to integrate Rollup in your Gulp bundling pipeline.</p>","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","_id":"clmb1082z002lkbow3xw710h6"}],"tags":[{"name":"SPA","_id":"clmb10858006fkbow5ys4gmeq"},{"name":"Bundling","_id":"clmb10858006hkbowgr0thnus"}],"_path":"post/Running-Rollup-with-Gulp/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Running-Rollup-with-Gulp/","_id":"clmb10815001vkbowg13t8bmr"},{"title":"Safely remove multiple classes using a prefix","date":"2021-01-18T10:17:46.000Z","description":"<p>Writing a Web App with HTML and JavaScript means you deal with several classes on your DOM elements in order to visualize state changes.

Already three years ago (omg … really?) I described in an article how to do this with Hexo: <a href=\"/post/Automatic-Header-Images-in-Hexo/\" title=\"Automatic Header Images in Hexo\">Automatic Header Images in Hexo</a>.</p>\n<p>To keep it short, I use a pool folder for this, in which I keep in subfolders next to a <code>meta.txt</code>, for the title of the image and an external url on 500px for interactions to the image, three variants that I need for a new post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mobile.jpg (width 480px)</li>\n<li>tablet.jpg (width 768px)</li>\n<li>normal.jpg (width 1280px)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only piece of the puzzle that was still missing was the automatic generation of these three image variants and the meta file based on a selected photo that I want to add to the pool of available header images. So far it was fun to generate the header images manually either on the desktop or on the smartphone, but it really doesn’t have to be. My goal now was to write a script where I just throw a selected photo into a folder and the NodeJS script does the rest.</p>\n<p>My photo workflow is based on Adobe Lightroom Classic and one of the steps is to give a title to the good ones I use here as well. So the script had to include four steps when iterating over the inbound folder’s JPG files:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>create new pool folder</li>\n<li>read meta data (IPTC -&gt; title) and write it to meta.txt</li>\n<li>create the three image variants</li>\n<li>delete the processed image from the inbound folder</li>\n</ol>","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","_id":"clmb1082z002lkbow3xw710h6"}],"tags":[{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clmb1085n007fkbow03bzf0ir"},{"name":"Node.js","_id":"clmb1086h0091kbow1buuezj0"}],"_path":"post/Pool-Photo-Generator/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Pool-Photo-Generator/","_id":"clmb1084a004hkbowc4yk9xs8"}]}
