So I relied on the worlds biggest search engine: Google. A search button, which drives out a small input field and with the pressing of the ENTER key the form was sent via GET to <code>//google.com/search</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Integration-of-Pagefind-in-Hexo/google-site-search.png\" alt=\"Google Site Search on kiko.io\"></p>\n<p>The procedure was simple, but also burdened with the fact that I always expose my users to Google. At least until now … :)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mstdn.social/@BryceWrayTX\">Bryce Wray</a> set me on a new path with his post <a href=\"https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2022/12/sweeter-searches-pagefind/\">Sweeter searches with Pagefind</a>, in which he talks about his experience with the still fairly fresh tool <a href=\"https://pagefind.app/\"><strong>Pagefind</strong></a>…</p>\n\n    <div>\n        <blockquote><p>Pagefind is a fully static search library that aims to perform well on large sites, while using as little of your users’ bandwidth as possible, and without hosting any infrastructure …</p>\n</blockquote>\n        <cite><a href=\"https://pagefind.app/\">--- Liam Bigelow @ pagefind.app</a></cite>\n    </div>\n  \n\n<p>Pardon me? A full text search for SSG’s running completely in the browser? It sounded so great that I had to try it right away. And what can I say … it not only works fantastically well, but is also extremely easy to implement. Of course, you have to consider a few things, especially with regard to the SSG Hexo I use, but I didn’t find any big hurdles, also because the tool is so <a href=\"https://pageind.app/\">well documented</a>. Let’s see what my implementation looks like…</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clo17zzn8003vqxoqh7fk85cn"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","_id":"clo17zzn5003qqxoqbpxe87rb"},{"name":"Blogging","_id":"clo17zznc0046qxoqe8bqe7kn"},{"name":"Search","_id":"clo17zzqz00e9qxoqfldt10hm"}],"_path":"post/Integration-of-Pagefind-in-Hexo/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Integration-of-Pagefind-in-Hexo/","_id":"clo17zzlt0039qxoq754dfvrt"},{"title":"Pagefind UI and URL Parameters","date":"2023-01-31T10:04:00.000Z","description":"<div class=\"alertbox alertbox-exclamation\">\n      <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Parts of the original post are outdated, as Pagefind <strong>DOES</strong> offer a way to preset a search string, which just hasn’t been documented yet … \\o&#x2F; … see below.</p>\n\n    </div>\n  \n\n<hr>\n<p>A couple of days ago I wrote about my attempt to <a href=\"/post/Integration-of-Pagefind-in-Hexo/\" title=\"Integration of Pagefind in Hexo\">integrate Pagefind in my blog</a>. In the meantime, I further refined the indexing by excluding more content areas and adding more for the metadata to make the search results even better.</p>\n<p>But one thing was still missing: controlling the search via url parameters, so that you can actually consider the page as a search page. I came across this in a post about the sense and nonsense of Open Graph attributes and other search engine related metadata nowadays. Google, for example, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data\">likes to use JSON-LD</a> and when describing the site you can define a search page which then makes it easier to search the site directly via Google … see <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/sitelinks-searchbox\">Sitelinks search box (WebSite) structured data</a></p>\n<p>In my implementation, I decided to adapt the <a href=\"https://pagefind.app/docs/ui/\">Pagefind UI</a> for myself instead of developing everything from scratch via JavaScript. There are always some limitations with pre-built solutions, but I want to show here that they are actually none for the inclusion of a url parameter.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clo17zzn8003vqxoqh7fk85cn"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","_id":"clo17zzn5003qqxoqbpxe87rb"},{"name":"Blogging","_id":"clo17zznc0046qxoqe8bqe7kn"},{"name":"Search","_id":"clo17zzqz00e9qxoqfldt10hm"}],"_path":"post/Pagefind-UI-and-URL-Parameters/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Pagefind-UI-and-URL-Parameters/","_id":"clo17zzlv003dqxoqh69faly1"},{"title":"Provide Blog Metadata via JSON-LD","date":"2023-02-09T23:00:00.000Z","description":"<p>Chris Coyier’s post “<a href=\"https://chriscoyier.net/2023/01/28/open-graph-blues/\">Open Graph Blues</a>“ got me thinking that my blog’s metadata, which are used by Google among others to index my pages, aren’t really at the cutting edge anymore.
