From time to time I contribute small things to GitHub projects and sometimes get confused with all the commands. <code>Fork</code>, <code>Clone</code>, <code>Commit</code>, <code>Stage</code>, <code>Pull Request</code> … all things that mean something to me, but that I certainly haven’t internalized. And so it happens that I sometimes mess up a pull request or something similar.</p>\n<p>Sure, my blog here also lives in GitHub, both in terms of source control and hosting on GitHub Pages, but here I’m the only one committing. No issues, no branches, no pull requests or anything else. I change something, hit commit and I’m done.</p>\n<p>Another point I can’t dismiss: I’m a Windows guy who likes to click buttons. The command line is not for me at all.<br><em>What was the name of the parameter? Do I have to write <code>--param=xxx</code> or <code>/param:xxx</code> … damn where is the button?</em><br>My brain is probably too small for that.</p>\n<p>Visual Studio Code is a big help there … it has buttons! But that doesn’t save me when it comes to Git, because you have to know in which order to press which of these buttons!</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clmnaz5eo003mkuot7q7p6v82"}],"tags":[{"name":"VS Code","_id":"clmnaz5eq003rkuotg9ts0zcr"},{"name":"Publishing","_id":"clmnaz5fi0068kuotal2q0552"},{"name":"Git/GitHub","_id":"clmnaz5hi00d5kuotepotbqmf"}],"_path":"post/Contribute-with-Conventional-Commits/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Contribute-with-Conventional-Commits/","_id":"clmnaz5dg002wkuot98z61v9f"}]}
