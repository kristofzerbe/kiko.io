I described the way to do this in <a href=\"/post/Show-pages-meta-data-JSON-LD-in-Bottom-Sheet/\">a post</a> a couple three weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Shortly after that <a href=\"https://octodon.social/@koos\">Koos Looijensteijn</a> triggered me with his post <a href=\"https://www.kooslooijesteijn.net/blog/digital-business-cards-vcard-qr-code-website\">How to make digital business cards and share them via QR codes</a> and I felt like using my newly introduced dialog manager based on downupPopup for my own contact card.<br><strong>But more about that at a later time, respectively blog post…</strong></p>\n<p>Important for this post is that Ali’s bottom sheet solution did not offer everything I wanted for my implementation:</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-Make-Dialog-Reusable\"><a href=\"#1-Make-Dialog-Reusable\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1. Make Dialog Reusable\"></a>1. Make Dialog Reusable</h2><p>As I have already described in the above mentioned article: Ali’s approach to calling the dialog was to create and initialize the necessary HTML elements if it didn’t already exist in the DOM. I pulled out the initialization to make the component reusable. There is now a preparation part and an initialization part and the latter is always called, no matter if another bottom sheet dialog was already created before.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ali-dincer/downupPopup.js/pull/2/commits/f3751ca56c4809decc1ec3845e5c301a13292773\">My GitHub commit on this part</a>…</p>","categories":[{"name":"UI/UX","_id":"clowtnrww003rmjn0evt2hdrd"}],"tags":[{"name":"UI","_id":"clowtnrxd003smjn0aonib7o1"},{"name":"GitHub","_id":"clowtnrxk004emjn03qmu4qp2"},{"name":"jQuery","_id":"clowtnrxn004qmjn02ket1f04"},{"name":"Contributing","_id":"clowtns0800e5mjn0fmsmary5"}],"_path":"post/Extension-of-downupPopup-Back-Button-Escape-Key-More/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Extension-of-downupPopup-Back-Button-Escape-Key-More/","_id":"clowtnrwb0035mjn00iaj0iwm"}]}
