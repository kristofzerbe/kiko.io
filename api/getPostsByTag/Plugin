And I mean <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/de/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html\">Lightroom Classic</a> and not the new web&#x2F;smartphone based software, which doesn’t come even close to the desktop application yet.</p>\n<p>I use Lightroom for all purposes after I shot my images: editing, cataloguing, managing and … publishing. On publishing Lightroom offers you two approaches: <em>Export</em> and <em>Publish</em>. While <em>Export</em> is mainly for creating JPG copies of edited RAW images, <em>Publish</em> goes one step further and gives you the ability to do “something” with your exported JPG’s, for example upload them on Flickr, Instagram, 500px or to your own web server via FTP. Major difference to <em>Export</em> is, that <em>Publish</em> keeps your images in sync. Everytime you change the source images, the defined publish services recognizes and offer you to re-publish your image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/lr-re-publish.png\" alt=\"Lightroom Publish\"></p>\n<p>In the past years I tried a lot of Lightroom plugins for publishing on several platforms, but it doesn’t work out for long, because all these platforms change their API almost every year (or are stamped) and the sparely maintained 3rd party plugins break.</p>\n<p>My workflow for quite some time is to publish my photos on the hard drive, in a folder, which is synced via Dropbox with the cloud. From there I distribute them further.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Photo-Editing","_id":"clll6ompz004jk2oagluqal8r"}],"tags":[{"name":"Lightroom","_id":"clll6omqo0063k2oa43zb7a6s"},{"name":"Publishing","_id":"clll6omqp0065k2oa9lmn6v4x"},{"name":"Plugin","_id":"clll6omqq0067k2oag7w84k2y"}],"_path":"post/Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/","_id":"clll6omm3000rk2oaaf3qchbu"},{"title":"Forking Hexo plugin 'hexo-index-anything'","date":"2021-04-25T11:41:46.000Z","description":"<p>As I started with this blog 2 years ago, I wanted to document the customization of Hexo to my needs in a series of articles.

Depending on your needs, you can choose out of trillions of solutions, for every JS framework or vanilla JS, in every flavour, size and color.
