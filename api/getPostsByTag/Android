To add a new card, I use a simple little script on my Android smartphone, I wrote about here: <a href=\"/post/Add-website-to-Trello-card-the-better-way/\" title=\"Add website to Trello card the better way\">Add website to Trello card the better way</a>.</p>\n<p>On processing the page to store on a card, Trello scrapes the page and takes the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag <code>og:image</code> out of the HTML to generate an image attachment and take it as cover for the card. This sometimes works, but most of the time it doesn’t, because website owners often don’t pay attention to reasonable <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n<p>Because it is easier to find a card with visual support, I create my own screenshots for the cards in a manual, but streamlined, process, I want to show you here.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Misc","_id":"clp78c8wa003zn8q5aiwvej5i"}],"tags":[{"name":"Trello","_id":"clp78c8ww005on8q5ek0x0070"},{"name":"Android","_id":"clp78c8ym00b2n8q54s6qgznm"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clp78c8yn00b4n8q5106p4z4j"}],"_path":"post/Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/","_id":"clp78c8uk001nn8q572rw9szx"},{"title":"Add Link to Trello on Android via Share Menu","date":"2023-11-13T16:11:47.000Z","description":"<p>I have been collecting interesting links in various Trello boards for many years and also process some of them automatically, such as my <a href=\"/collections/tiny-tools\">Tiny Tools</a>.</p>\n<p>However, the official Trello Android App has the problem eversince that, when you want to create a URL as a Trello card in the browser, the URL is entered in the <code>Description</code> and not as an <code>Attachment</code>, where it actually belongs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Add-Link-to-Trello-on-Android-via-Share-Menu/share-trello-app.png\" alt=\"Share Link with Trello App\"></p>\n<p>I have solved this for myself for years using a <strong>bookmarklet</strong> in the Chrome browser (see <a href=\"/post/Add-website-to-Trello-card-the-better-way/\" title=\"Add website to Trello card the better way\">Add website to Trello card the better way</a>) and get along quite well with it. However, there is one catch, that has annoyed me ever since:<br>I find an interesting link in the Mastodon WebApp, for example, and tap on it. What opens, however, is the WebView integrated in Android and not my standard Chrome browser, in which the bookmarklet would be available. So, for links that I want to store, I always have to open the WebView menu and select “Open in Chrome Browser”. I cannot use the general SHARE menu. At least not so far … :)</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clp78c8wc0043n8q540ye4crs"}],"tags":[{"name":"Trello","_id":"clp78c8ww005on8q5ek0x0070"},{"name":"Android","_id":"clp78c8ym00b2n8q54s6qgznm"}],"_path":"post/Add-Link-to-Trello-on-Android-via-Share-Menu/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Add-Link-to-Trello-on-Android-via-Share-Menu/","_id":"clp78c8v0002xn8q577rwdp42"},{"title":"Handling IPTC metadata on Android and Windows","date":"2023-10-28T12:00:55.000Z","description":"<p>Most of the photos that I prepare for this website for example, I take with my big Nikon camera in RAW format and then edit them under Windows in <strong>Adobe Lightroom Classic</strong>. I always give the image a name and a few keywords, which are then also displayed on the photo page. Lightroom stores these as <a href=\"https://www.iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/\"><strong>IPTC metadata</strong></a> in the sidecar file and writes them, when exporting the image, directly into the header of the generated JPG file.</p>\n<p>Now, however, I take pictures on the go with my Pixel smartphone and process them with the Google Photos Android app, and although the <strong>IPTC</strong> standard is only 30 years old, <strong>Google doesn’t support it!</strong> You can give the image a “description” but it is not written into the image as a metadata, but is probably lying around somewhere on the Google servers.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Photo","_id":"clp78c8wn0053n8q5cnroe7w5"}],"tags":[{"name":"Windows","_id":"clp78c8x8006jn8q59pqj33cm"},{"name":"Android","_id":"clp78c8ym00b2n8q54s6qgznm"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clp78c8yn00b4n8q5106p4z4j"},{"name":"Metadata","_id":"clp78c8zz00epn8q5dgh9csrl"}],"_path":"post/Handling-IPTC-metadata-on-Android-and-Windows/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Handling-IPTC-metadata-on-Android-and-Windows/","_id":"clp78c8v4003an8q5d8ql5nfp"}]}
