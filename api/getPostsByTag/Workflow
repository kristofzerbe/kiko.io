To internalize things by writing them down and to give my future me the chance to look up something I did in the past. So is this post. Future me: Don’t forget the following!</p>\n<p>I while ago I was on a trip, shooting a lot of photographs and on my way back home I had three 32GB SD cards full with great photos. I was working with my old Nikon D7000, which has 2 card slots and I just took them out, when one of the cards was full. Worked fine for several years … but after this trip, one of the cards, full with RAW files and wonderful photos, <strong>w-a-s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N-O-T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r-e-a-d-a-b-l-e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a-n-y-m-o-r-e</strong> … f***! I saved myself the backup and now had to suffer over my carelessness.</p>\n<p>I thought about some fancy and expensive backup solutions for professional photographers, but realized after a while, that I already had the equipment to achieve everything I needed and I could even use it to improve my general workflow.</p>\n<p>In this post, I want to show you, what my workflow looks like today and how yours might benefit from my mistake.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Photo-Editing","_id":"cllhuh2sc004bjzop4qtg8zdy"}],"tags":[{"name":"Lightroom","_id":"cllhuh2st005rjzop2jxs19vo"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"cllhuh2tg007jjzopa44f1x5o"},{"name":"Workflow","_id":"cllhuh2u600a5jzop9fnvb069"}],"_path":"post/Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/","_id":"cllhuh2qd001rjzopde3s66c4"},{"title":"One mouse to rule them all","date":"2022-10-08T09:46:57.000Z","description":"<p><strong>Multiple monitors on one computer are elementary for effective IT work. However, operating multiple computers with one input set requires tools, for example one from the Microsoft Garage.</strong></p>\n<p>The trend is toward second or third devices, especially among IT workers. In addition to the stationary computer, which may still be under the desk, there is a laptop and possibly a tablet. All of them are connected to cloud services. If the desk is large enough, there may be two monitors and a full-size keyboard connected to the desktop, the laptop on the left, on which two or three special programs are installed, and the Surface tablet on the right for communication with its narrow-track keyboard. And spread out on the table are three mice in different colors so as not to constantly get the wrong one. A scenario that the author of these lines was also confronted with … yes, until a few years ago a small tool for Microsoft Windows fell in front of his feet, which abruptly ended the input chaos: Mouse Without Borders.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"cllhuh2s0003bjzop5kzv2839"}],"tags":[{"name":"Windows","_id":"cllhuh2sr005njzop0sqv980u"},{"name":"Workflow","_id":"cllhuh2u600a5jzop9fnvb069"},{"name":"Remote","_id":"cllhuh2uo00bujzopbx4cd0jc"}],"_path":"post/One-mouse-to-rule-them-all/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/One-mouse-to-rule-them-all/","_id":"cllhuh2qt002njzoper7dcx15"}]}
