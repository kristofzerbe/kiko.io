The US internet company makes it very easy for users to use its web-based services. The entry barriers are low and the interfaces are tidy and intuitive.</p>\n<p>If you use the in-house Chrome browser, you can also be informed about incoming mails or upcoming appointments. One click and the browser opens with Gmail or Google Calendar …</p>\n<p>But it is not always necessary or desirable to load one of the Google tools completely in a new browser window, when you may already have two or three dozen tabs open in several windows and are in danger of losing track of them.</p>\n<p>That’s what Montreal-based software developer <strong><a href=\"https://jasonsavard.com/\">Jason Savard</a></strong> seems to have thought ten years ago. At that time, he began writing a Chrome extension that would report a newly received Gmail by means of a small icon in the extension bar of the browser and display it directly in a separate pop-up window by clicking on it. The result was <strong><a href=\"https://jasonsavard.com/Checker-Plus-for-Gmail\">Checker Plus for Gmail</a></strong>.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clmj94hbd003lkjq33g7zaa2r"}],"tags":[{"name":"Browser","_id":"clmj94hbe003okjq36x3o2xod"},{"name":"Plugin","_id":"clmj94hct0069kjq3dsse4krp"},{"name":"Mail","_id":"clmj94hfk00bskjq32bijazbe"}],"_path":"post/Checker-Plus-Gmail-in-better/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Checker-Plus-Gmail-in-better/","_id":"clmj94h99002bkjq33v6ghupq"},{"title":"Old Sweetheart Rediscovered","date":"2022-06-21T11:21:15.000Z","description":"<p>It seems like ages ago that I wrote a tool called <strong>OutlookSignature</strong> with Visual Basic 6 and put it on the web on my old German blog <strong>zerbit.de</strong>. But the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111116021952/http://www.zerbit.de/projekte/outlooksignature.aspx\">WayBackMachine</a> says something different.

Just 14 years ago…</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Old-Sweetheart-Rediscovered/zerbit-outlooksignature.png\" alt=\"OutlookSignature on zerbit.de ten years ago\"></p>\n<p>The thing was a command line tool, that could be used to automatically generate signatures for Microsoft Outlook in the three formats TXT, RTF and HTML, for example centrally via a Windows login script for the entire organization. No hassle anymore for the users on creating an appropriate mail signature and no more stress for the marketing department in enforcing a uniform appearance. It was based on templates with placeholders for the data and configurable via an INI file. The data could come either from the ActiveDirectory via LDAP or from any database.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clmj94hbd003lkjq33g7zaa2r"}],"tags":[{"name":"Mail","_id":"clmj94hfk00bskjq32bijazbe"},{"name":"Office","_id":"clmj94hfv00cikjq30wu53sc0"}],"_path":"post/Old-Sweetheart-Rediscovered/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Old-Sweetheart-Rediscovered/","_id":"clmj94h9h002nkjq3ayhghe07"}]}
