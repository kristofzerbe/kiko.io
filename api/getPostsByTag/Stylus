The only thing I needed was a toggle element and a little bit of JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Of course, I couldn’t manipulate the <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#descdef-media-prefers-color-scheme\">media query <code>prefers-color-scheme</code></a> itself, but introduce a different way by blog uses it. Instead of implementing the media query directly into my CSS (or Stylus) code, I used a root selector, which can be manipulated by JavaScript … something like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight css\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"selector-tag\">body</span> &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attribute\">background-color</span>: white;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attribute\">color</span>: black;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"selector-attr\">[data-theme=<span class=\"string\">&quot;dark&quot;</span>]</span> <span class=\"selector-tag\">body</span> &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attribute\">background-color</span>: black;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attribute\">color</span>: white;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clm1uxfo8003jk3ol3b6jhl40"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","_id":"clm1uxfo7003ik3ola3r0hawh"},{"name":"CSS","_id":"clm1uxfo8003kk3ol4gnwe3ml"},{"name":"Stylus","_id":"clm1uxfon004gk3ol5xy8cxoq"},{"name":"Dark Mode","_id":"clm1uxfoo004ik3ol1v1j9j2w"}],"_path":"post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode-revised/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode-revised/","_id":"clm1uxfku000dk3ol92pi2joi"},{"title":"Hexo and the Dark Mode","date":"2019-10-23T13:28:04.000Z","description":"<p>Due to the fact, that nowadays everybody is talking about Dark Modes for Browsers and Operating Systems, in order to save battery or for easier reading (uhh, really?), I decided my blog should support that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode/screen-recording-1.gif\" alt=\"Switching Dark Mode in Windows 10\"></p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clm1uxfo8003jk3ol3b6jhl40"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","_id":"clm1uxfo7003ik3ola3r0hawh"},{"name":"CSS","_id":"clm1uxfo8003kk3ol4gnwe3ml"},{"name":"Stylus","_id":"clm1uxfon004gk3ol5xy8cxoq"},{"name":"Dark Mode","_id":"clm1uxfoo004ik3ol1v1j9j2w"}],"_path":"post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode/","_id":"clm1uxfkv000ek3ol6mugg57h"},{"title":"Horizontal navigation menu above an image","date":"2020-07-20T13:55:47.000Z","description":"<p>I changed the main menu of my blog, because I wanted to get rid of the hamburger menu on the upper left, which was shown only for smartphones, but was not really reachable conveniently.
