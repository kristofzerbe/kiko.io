Colors &amp; Shapes …</p>\n<p>In July I was for a few days with friends on a finca in the south of Mallorca and of course I used every opportunity to stick my lens everywhere where there were interesting details to be expected. I don’t know if it had anything to do with the heat, but most of the motifs have a very earthy touch. I probably wanted to stay somewhere underground all the time, because 40 degrees Celsius in the shade was then also a bit too much for me.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Photo","_id":"clp3xjcnt0052m3oz6ws36hlc"}],"tags":[{"name":"Publishing","_id":"clp3xjco7006om3ozde23a85d"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clp3xjcpf00b3m3ozbjt09iu6"}],"_path":"post/Majorcan-Details/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Majorcan-Details/","_id":"clp3xjcmf003cm3oza4qdgwm5"},{"title":"Pool Photo Generator","date":"2023-08-20T22:00:00.000Z","description":"<p>Since the existence of this blog, the posts all have a custom header image that I generate from my own photos. Already three years ago (omg … really?) I described in an article how to do this with Hexo: <a href=\"/post/Automatic-Header-Images-in-Hexo/\" title=\"Automatic Header Images in Hexo\">Automatic Header Images in Hexo</a>.</p>\n<p>To keep it short, I use a pool folder for this, in which I keep in subfolders next to a <code>meta.txt</code>, for the title of the image and an external url on 500px for interactions to the image, three variants that I need for a new post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mobile.jpg (width 480px)</li>\n<li>tablet.jpg (width 768px)</li>\n<li>normal.jpg (width 1280px)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only piece of the puzzle that was still missing was the automatic generation of these three image variants and the meta file based on a selected photo that I want to add to the pool of available header images. So far it was fun to generate the header images manually either on the desktop or on the smartphone, but it really doesn’t have to be. My goal now was to write a script where I just throw a selected photo into a folder and the NodeJS script does the rest.</p>\n<p>My photo workflow is based on Adobe Lightroom Classic and one of the steps is to give a title to the good ones I use here as well. So the script had to include four steps when iterating over the inbound folder’s JPG files:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>create new pool folder</li>\n<li>read meta data (IPTC -&gt; title) and write it to meta.txt</li>\n<li>create the three image variants</li>\n<li>delete the processed image from the inbound folder</li>\n</ol>","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","_id":"clp3xjcnl0048m3oz9cr8ck91"}],"tags":[{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clp3xjcpf00b3m3ozbjt09iu6"},{"name":"Node.js","_id":"clp3xjcpt00crm3oz32ia2u0l"}],"_path":"post/Pool-Photo-Generator/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Pool-Photo-Generator/","_id":"clp3xjcmh003hm3oz49u9gywg"},{"title":"Speyer Automotive","date":"2023-11-15T15:13:13.000Z","description":"<p>In September, my wife and I took a trip to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technik_Museum_Speyer\">Museum of Technology in nearby Speyer</a>. I don’t really know why I’ve never been there before, not even as a child, because the collection of cars and aeroplanes is quite unique in Germany.

And exactly this can be found in Speyer: A large part for cars of all kinds and the outside area for aeroplanes and even ships. Even a spaceship, the Russian Space Shuttle alternative <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_programme\">Buran</a> can be seen there.</p>\n<p>Here are a few pictures of the car exhibition that I brought back from there and which will be used as post header images hero on kiko.io in the future …</p>","categories":[{"name":"Photo","_id":"clp3xjcnt0052m3oz6ws36hlc"}],"tags":[{"name":"Publishing","_id":"clp3xjco7006om3ozde23a85d"},{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clp3xjcpf00b3m3ozbjt09iu6"}],"_path":"post/Speyer-Automotive/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Speyer-Automotive/","_id":"clp3xjcmk003rm3oz4tbu7upx"}]}
