But no UI means not, that you don’t want to get some information about the status of the running program. The means of choice in C#&#x2F;.NET is then the output of certain values in the console via <code>console.WriteLine()</code>.</p>\n<p>But often these applications are supposed to run in the background or hidden, so that crashes or errors are not immediately noticeable if you don’t have at least a rudimentary logging built in. Such logging is also useful for the later evaluation of program runs. For this reason pretty much all programs log in some way. Currently there an incredible number of logging frameworks available, that make it to the news every now and then, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell\">Log4Shell</a> for Java.</p>\n<p>The best known in the .NET area is Microsoft’s own <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging\">ILogger (Microsoft.Extensions.Logging)</a>, <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4net/\">log4net</a>, <a href=\"https://nlog-project.org/\">NLog</a> and <a href=\"https://serilog.net/\">Serilog</a>. What they all have in common is, that they are highly flexible in terms of configuration, usage and storage of the logs. On the other hand, they are fat beasts, you have to learn to handle first and you have to deliver with the program always. The latter does not apply to the ILogger, but Microsoft has been known to complicate things so unnecessarily that it is almost no fun anymore.</p>\n<p>Many times this overload is simply not necessary, when you just need a log file for each run of your console application.
