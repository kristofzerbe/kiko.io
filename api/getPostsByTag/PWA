We have learned that well and no one questions it … but … the IT world keeps on turning and today we are not only talking about files, but about links.</p>\n<p>Many modern applications are written with Web technologies, thanks to cross platform frameworks like <a href=\"https://www.electronjs.org/\">Electron</a>. Some of them are real apps for working on things, like the famous editor <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>, and some are mirroring their online services in a desktop app only, like <a href=\"https://slack.com/intl/en-de/downloads/windows\">Slack</a> or <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/desktop\">Notion</a>. However, the latter have the problem how to deal with links to their online services. When a user is sent a link and has become accustomed to using the desktop app, it won’t open in the app as he clicks on it, but in his default browser.

Unfortunately, the app itself didn’t get any of this because there was no communication channel for them to talk.</p>\n<p>If you research this topic on the web, you have to dig through many architecture pages and documentations that have one thing in common: sometimes they just don’t get to the point.
