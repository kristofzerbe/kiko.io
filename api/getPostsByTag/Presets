After I’m back home and start the image processing, I develop a particular look for my images of the past vacation or event. This has a lot to do with my mood and is very intuitive. Not all images are the same in terms of composition and light and so I create usually 3 or 4 different presets each time during image processing.</p>\n<p>Back in 2019, I was traveling around Israel, a fascinating country where almost every wall has a story to tell and I was listening through my viewfinder.

It combines the sometimes rugged English flair with the art of living of France, both scenically and in the architecture and the way people live there. My wife likes all things English and I am a friend of the french ‘Savoir Vivre’, and we were able to combine the two beautifully on a trip to Saint-Malo and Jersey.
