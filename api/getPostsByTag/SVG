Roughly speaking, two known points in space can be used to calculate a third via the angles to it. In one or the other Hollywood flick of the genres war or spy movie you have surely come across this.</p>\n<p>However, triangulation also refers to the division of a surface into triangles or, more generally, the description of an object by means of polygons. It is used in topology and land surveying, but also in imaging methods of modeling.</p>\n<p>How wonderfully this field of mathematics can be applied to photos is shown by the GitHub user <a href=\"https://github.com/RH12503\"><strong>RyanH</strong></a> with his program <a href=\"https://github.com/RH12503/triangula\"><strong>Triangula</strong></a> written in Go, which first roughly splits a given JPG or PNG image into triangles and then refines it further and further via mutations. Among other things, you can specify how many points you want to start with and how many mutations the program should perform. It is also possible to calculate the new image using hexagons instead of classic triangles.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clmmdc8x5003mjfopep7ce5yp"}],"tags":[{"name":"Imaging","_id":"clmmdc8yy007yjfopeo8c4zc3"},{"name":"SVG","_id":"clmmdc8zy00axjfopc5flappb"}],"_path":"post/Tringula-And-The-Beauty-Of-Mathematics/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Tringula-And-The-Beauty-Of-Mathematics/","_id":"clmmdc8ve0021jfopd84b2jph"},{"title":"Creating Icon Font from SVG Files","date":"2022-09-17T13:08:34.000Z","description":"<p>A several years ago I started building a little PWA and chose <a href=\"https://bootswatch.com/3/\">Bootswatch 3.3.5.</a> for theming. As it depends on Bootstrap I was able to use the <a href=\"https://icons.getbootstrap.com/\">icons from Bootstrap</a>. At the beginning I needed only a handful of these icons, but with the time it became more and more difficult to find the right one, because the Bootstrap Glyphicons in version 3 included only around 250 icons and there was not always the right one. Also, the app was always lugging around well over 100 KB of extra files, of which I actually only needed a few kilobytes.</p>\n<p>In another project I had used <a href=\"https://fontello.com/\">Fontello</a>, where you can build and download your own icon font from a selection of available icons. Very nice, but I didn’t feel like fiddling with project-specific configuration files on the Fontello website. But since you could upload your own SVG files in Fontello, which were then taken over into the font, the same had to work somehow with a Node.JS plugin!?</p>\n<p>And yes <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-iconfont\">gulp-iconfont</a> from <a href=\"https://github.com/nfroidure\">Nicolas Froidure</a> was exactly what I needed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Creating-Icon-Font-from-SVG-Files/gulp-iconfont.png\" alt=\"gulp-iconfont on GitHub\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"First-Solution\"><a href=\"#First-Solution\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"First Solution\"></a>First Solution</h2><p>Just copy a bunch of SVG files in a folder, run gulp and there was my own customized icon font with a tolerable size of around 20 kilobytes. At that time, <a href=\"https://github.com/backflip\">Thomas Jaggi</a> had taken care of the creation of a CSS file with the correct code points that matched the font with his tool <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-iconfont-css\">gulp-iconfont-css</a>.</p>","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","_id":"clmmdc8x8003sjfopb893h500"}],"tags":[{"name":"Bundling","_id":"clmmdc8yf006jjfopaavh5omn"},{"name":"SVG","_id":"clmmdc8zy00axjfopc5flappb"},{"name":"Font","_id":"clmmdc90b00bwjfopgcpkeeps"}],"_path":"post/Creating-Icon-Font-from-SVG-Files/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Creating-Icon-Font-from-SVG-Files/","_id":"clmmdc8vk002cjfope1edhg4e"}]}
