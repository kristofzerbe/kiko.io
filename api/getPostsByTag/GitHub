With tips, hints and snippets from several websites I got it running and the solution was absolutely memorable. For myself and for others. Nothing is harder than to know ‘you did this before…’, but not to remember how.</p>\n<p>Because of this strong leaning towards oblivion, I started over 20 years ago my very first website <strong>zerbit.de</strong>, manually crafted with Classic ASP and a SQL Server database as backend, with an editor, tagging, categories and so on. It was really exciting to build this blog from scratch and writing articles for it, but it was so time consuming to expand the features of the website and keep it running, that some day I quit it silently.</p>\n<p>So, to document the solution mentioned above, I could use tools like OneNote or others, like in the past years, but this would be just for me and not for all developers, who have a similar problem. I felt it would be unfair to participate from the knowledge of others to get my solution and dont give something back.</p>\n<p>I decided to write an article just in HTML and publish it on my personal GitHub Page that I didn’t used so far. Ok, just Text … ugly. Just a little CSS and a little more structure and maybe I should do something with Vue JS … STOP … It would be better to pick one of the cool new static website generators based on Node.js, to detain myself from inventing the wheel again and save my time to write articles.
