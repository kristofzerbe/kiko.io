With tips, hints and snippets from several websites I got it running and the solution was absolutely memorable. For myself and for others. Nothing is harder than to know ‘you did this before…’, but not to remember how.</p>\n<p>Because of this strong leaning towards oblivion, I started over 20 years ago my very first website <strong>zerbit.de</strong>, manually crafted with Classic ASP and a SQL Server database as backend, with an editor, tagging, categories and so on. It was really exciting to build this blog from scratch and writing articles for it, but it was so time consuming to expand the features of the website and keep it running, that some day I quit it silently.</p>\n<p>So, to document the solution mentioned above, I could use tools like OneNote or others, like in the past years, but this would be just for me and not for all developers, who have a similar problem. I felt it would be unfair to participate from the knowledge of others to get my solution and dont give something back.</p>\n<p>I decided to write an article just in HTML and publish it on my personal GitHub Page that I didn’t used so far. Ok, just Text … ugly. Just a little CSS and a little more structure and maybe I should do something with Vue JS … STOP … It would be better to pick one of the cool new static website generators based on Node.js, to detain myself from inventing the wheel again and save my time to write articles. So I did a little research and found <a href=\"https://hexo.io/\">HEXO</a> … Bingo! I can work with my favorite editor <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>, its all HTML, JavaScript and CSS, I can write my articles in Markdown and Hexo has a lot of helpers for stuff Markdown doesn’t provide, it produces static files and works only with files, therefore no need for a database … and it is well documented.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clmzdvv4v003mkcok5uzx5v0b"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","_id":"clmzdvv4u003lkcokfgrtd4sj"},{"name":"VS Code","_id":"clmzdvv4x003rkcok25judvhx"},{"name":"GitHub","_id":"clmzdvv4y003vkcok0vyo0u2z"},{"name":"Blogging","_id":"clmzdvv4z003xkcok21p48obb"}],"_path":"post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","_id":"clmzdvv2h000akcokfel9cz7q"},{"title":"GitHubs Magic Dot","date":"2021-08-20T11:43:04.000Z","description":"<p>GitHub has released the long awaited solution für code editing in the web today, or more precisely, the two new solutions: <a href=\"https://github.com/features/codespaces\"><strong>CodeSpaces</strong> and <strong>github.dev</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>As Brigit Murtaugh and Allison Weins pointed out in their presentation at the live stream on Youtube (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3hHhRME_XI\">VS Code anywhere: GitHub Codespaces and github.dev</a>), both solutions are based on the codebase of Visual Studio Code, but have different approaches and target groups.</p>\n<p>Where <strong>Codespaces</strong> is an online editor with computing capabilities (realized by running a VM in the backend) and is only available für paid plans, <strong>github.dev</strong> is a free online editor to change files in your GitHub repo as you do it in your local VSCode, but without running and debugging capabilities.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"clmzdvv4v003mkcok5uzx5v0b"}],"tags":[{"name":"Browser","_id":"clmzdvv4w003pkcok8wi69ric"},{"name":"VS Code","_id":"clmzdvv4x003rkcok25judvhx"},{"name":"GitHub","_id":"clmzdvv4y003vkcok0vyo0u2z"}],"_path":"post/GitHubs-Magic-Dot/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/GitHubs-Magic-Dot/","_id":"clmzdvv35001jkcokchwf9qgs"},{"title":"Hexo Tag Plugin Collection","date":"2021-12-12T13:07:36.000Z","description":"<p>Since day one of this blog I use <strong>Tag Plugins</strong>, sometimes as NPM packages from other developers, sometimes developed by myself.</p>\n<p>The latter have grown significantly over time and I want to share them with you by publishing them in a Github project called <strong>hexo-tag-plugins</strong>, where you can download and use those you need on extending your own Hexo based blog.</p>\n<p>On the Github page you can find all the info on how to use the plugins.

Fat in terms of features, for sure, but also in size and load times. It made no sense to use an other IDE, while developing software with VB.NET&#x2F;C#. But with the advent of Node.JS JavaScript, so far only known as a scripting language for web pages, outgrew itself and became a serious competitor to established languages.</p>\n<p>In 2012 Adobe came out with <a href=\"https://brackets.io/\">Brackets</a>, a lightweight IDE for developing web applications, written with the very same tech stack: HTML, CSS and JavaScript! Based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework\">Chromium Embedded Framework</a>, it felt like a normal application! Mind blowing…</p>\n<p>In 2015 there was a new kid in town: <strong><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a> (VS Code)</strong>, of all things from … Microsoft. During this time, the Redmond-based company had finally jumped on the open source bandwagon and perhaps they saw that Adobe was doing some things right on the IDE market with Brackets (but also some things wrong) and you didn’t want to miss the chance to engage the open source community.</p>\n<p>The speed with which VS Code passed other IDE’s in the developer favor was quite amazing, due to the fact that the source code was openly available on GitHub and the developers in Switzerland released a new version every damn month.</p>\n<p>What was exciting for me was the question of how long it would take for someone to make this IDE based on web technology available online, i.e. in a browser.
