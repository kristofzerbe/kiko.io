With tips, hints and snippets from several websites I got it running and the solution was absolutely memorable. For myself and for others. Nothing is harder than to know ‘you did this before…’, but not to remember how.</p>\n<p>Because of this strong leaning towards oblivion, I started over 20 years ago my very first website <strong>zerbit.de</strong>, manually crafted with Classic ASP and a SQL Server database as backend, with an editor, tagging, categories and so on. It was really exciting to build this blog from scratch and writing articles for it, but it was so time consuming to expand the features of the website and keep it running, that some day I quit it silently.</p>\n<p>So, to document the solution mentioned above, I could use tools like OneNote or others, like in the past years, but this would be just for me and not for all developers, who have a similar problem. I felt it would be unfair to participate from the knowledge of others to get my solution and dont give something back.</p>\n<p>I decided to write an article just in HTML and publish it on my personal GitHub Page that I didn’t used so far. Ok, just Text … ugly. Just a little CSS and a little more structure and maybe I should do something with Vue JS … STOP … It would be better to pick one of the cool new static website generators based on Node.js, to detain myself from inventing the wheel again and save my time to write articles. So I did a little research and found <a href=\"https://hexo.io/\">HEXO</a> … Bingo! I can work with my favorite editor <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>, its all HTML, JavaScript and CSS, I can write my articles in Markdown and Hexo has a lot of helpers for stuff Markdown doesn’t provide, it produces static files and works only with files, therefore no need for a database … and it is well documented.</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"cljodmhon0038hpos0axifc9k"}],"tags":[{"name":"VS Code","_id":"cljodmhon0039hpos0p5q80zu"},{"name":"Hexo","_id":"cljodmhoo003bhposhmrwde0k"},{"name":"GitHub","_id":"cljodmhop003dhposcyyc50qe"},{"name":"Blogging","_id":"cljodmhoq003fhpos522j6bq4"}],"_path":"post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","_id":"cljodmhlw0008hpos9l120s6j"},{"title":"Better Input Change Event","date":"2019-11-26T15:51:17.000Z","description":"<p>Often it is important to trigger an event, after the user of your website&#x2F;web app has filled out an text input.

On publishing Lightroom offers you two approaches: <em>Export</em> and <em>Publish</em>. While <em>Export</em> is mainly for creating JPG copies of edited RAW images, <em>Publish</em> goes one step further and gives you the ability to do “something” with your exported JPG’s, for example upload them on Flickr, Instagram, 500px or to your own web server via FTP. Major difference to <em>Export</em> is, that <em>Publish</em> keeps your images in sync. Everytime you change the source images, the defined publish services recognizes and offer you to re-publish your image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/post/Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/lr-re-publish.png\" alt=\"Lightroom Publish\"></p>\n<p>In the past years I tried a lot of Lightroom plugins for publishing on several platforms, but it doesn’t work out for long, because all these platforms change their API almost every year (or are stamped) and the sparely maintained 3rd party plugins break.</p>\n<p>My workflow for quite some time is to publish my photos on the hard drive, in a folder, which is synced via Dropbox with the cloud.

But what makes Facebook, Twitter and others “social” is the interaction between the people. Likes, Retweets, Mentions, Replies are the fuel which drives them.

However, most of them are relatively junk or try to foist malware on users. You have to make sure that you separate the wheat from the chaff. On the other hand, the situation is surprisingly different for Windows, the much older operating system. The older ones of us will still remember the glorious WinAmp times, whose current owner Radionomy has been making a very long new attempt for a new version 6 since 2018 (version 5.8 is already a handsome 6 years old), but you can actually count the good music players for Windows 10 and higher on one hand, if you subtract the streaming apps such as Spotify and Co. and disregard everything that comes along as a jack of all trades and can ALSO play MP3. The best known are the in Windows included and miserably failed iTunes clone from Micosoft called <strong>Groove</strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.aimp.ru/\">AIMP</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.foobar2000.org/\">foobar2000</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.mediamonkey.com/\">MediaMonkey</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.getmusicbee.com/\">MusicBee</a></strong>.

If you look at the download pages of these music player candidates and try to look behind the business model, some of them simply do not download. One or the other player also overdoes it with the featuritis.

I got myself a <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a> account, after many years of staying away from social media as far as I could and at most tweeting a new blog post. Since my active Twitter days, things have taken such a turn for the worse, that I’ve preferred to stay away completely.</p>\n<p>I don’t know what made me join Mastodon on Sunday, but it sparked something in me: The love for the good old internet of the late 90s, early 2000s. These guys gave me a warm welcome and made me feel that Internet communities, away from sleazy influencers and banner ads, could actually still work. I got a taste of it, when I let this blog become part of IndieWeb over a year ago, but didn’t quite believe in it because of the low traffic and mentions.</p>\n<p>Now the richest man on the planet has to come along and buy the bird site, and a niche product called Mastodon, well known but underestimated in tech circles, almost explodes under the onslaught of disappointed commercial users. And that’s what we are on Twitter, Facebook and Co … a commercial object.</p>\n<p>The problem now will be how the community can integrate these many users for whom it was not mentally prepared. What now adapts to whom? The most important thing, however, will be to teach the newcomers (and I count myself among them) that Mastodon is not Twitter in new clothes!</p>\n<p>I was going to write a few things about this, but this morning I read a Twitter thread from <a href=\"https://mastodon.green/@pjakobs\"><strong>Peter Jakobs</strong></a>, a self-proclaimed digital Aboriginal from Germany, that just sums it all up and explains it so well I could hardly do it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pjakobs/status/1590276045521195008\"><img src=\"/post/Mastodon-simply-explained/tweet-peter-jakobs-22-11-09.png\" alt=\"Tweet from Peter Jakobs, November 29, 2022\"></a></p>\n<p>That’s why I’m now doing something I’ve never done before: I quote Peter here completely, translated from German into English … Curtain up (and thank you <a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/en/translator\">DeepL</a> :D):</p>","categories":[{"name":"Tools","_id":"cljodmhon0038hpos0axifc9k"}],"tags":[{"name":"Publishing","_id":"cljodmhph005qhposgu225jzm"},{"name":"Social Media","_id":"cljodmhrb00brhposcgqlgxqq"}],"_path":"post/Mastodon-simply-explained/","_link":"https://kiko.io/post/Mastodon-simply-explained/","_id":"cljodmhnd002khposcshhc5er"},{"title":"Old Sweetheart Rediscovered","date":"2022-06-21T11:21:15.000Z","description":"<p>It seems like ages ago that I wrote a tool called <strong>OutlookSignature</strong> with Visual Basic 6 and put it on the web on my old German blog <strong>zerbit.de</strong>.

But no UI means not, that you don’t want to get some information about the status of the running program. The means of choice in C#&#x2F;.NET is then the output of certain values in the console via <code>console.WriteLine()</code>.</p>\n<p>But often these applications are supposed to run in the background or hidden, so that crashes or errors are not immediately noticeable if you don’t have at least a rudimentary logging built in. Such logging is also useful for the later evaluation of program runs. For this reason pretty much all programs log in some way. Currently there an incredible number of logging frameworks available, that make it to the news every now and then, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell\">Log4Shell</a> for Java.</p>\n<p>The best known in the .NET area is Microsoft’s own <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging\">ILogger (Microsoft.Extensions.Logging)</a>, <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4net/\">log4net</a>, <a href=\"https://nlog-project.org/\">NLog</a> and <a href=\"https://serilog.net/\">Serilog</a>. What they all have in common is, that they are highly flexible in terms of configuration, usage and storage of the logs. On the other hand, they are fat beasts, you have to learn to handle first and you have to deliver with the program always. The latter does not apply to the ILogger, but Microsoft has been known to complicate things so unnecessarily that it is almost no fun anymore.</p>\n<p>Many times this overload is simply not necessary, when you just need a log file for each run of your console application.
