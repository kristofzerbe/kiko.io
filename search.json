Creating, resizing and saving the screenshot\n2. Creating a new section in the post\n3. Setting a key for the post based on the title\n4. Setting the title\n5. Setting the author\n6. Setting the screenshot file\n\nI do use two tag plugins ([tag-anchorlist](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/kiko.io/blob/2c80a548e188c05879039a15e67419b548bfbfcd/themes/landscape/scripts/tag-anchorlist.js) and [tag-discovery](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/kiko.io/blob/2c80a548e188c05879039a15e67419b548bfbfcd/themes/landscape/scripts/tag-discovery.js)) for this in the post draft, but despite that, it's quite time-consuming and always the same procedure that can be wonderfully automated... and here I'd like to write about how I approached this task, while I'm working on it.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n---\n\n## The Trello List\n\nHow easy it is to save a link as a card in a Trello board via Chrome, I described recently in my post {% post_link 2020/Add-website-to-Trello-card-the-better-way %}. As this works also in Chrome on Android, I store interesting links on the go mostly. In order to get all information I need later on, I have extended my collections board with a custom field called 'Author'. For adding the screenshot to the card as an attachment, I use actually the build-in feature of Android 6.\n\nAs I have a long, long list if incoming links, I sort them by topic into an appropriate list, for example, \"Discoveries: JS Libraries\" and this lists should then be automatically turned into new blog posts as I want to publish one.\n\n![Trello Test Board](Generate-Content-from-Trello/trello-test-board.png)\n\n---\n\n## The Data\n\nNow, to get the raw data of a Trello list, I could use to the Atlassian API, but that's not even necessary, because each board can be accessed machine-readable per se via adding ``.JSON`` to the board url. **Prerequisite is that the board is set to PUBLIC**. The URL is structured according to the following scheme:\n\n``https://trello.com/b/<WORKPLACE-ID>/<BOARD-NAME>.json``\n\nThe URL accepts following parameters (as far as I found out), to filter out some not needed content:\n\n- **fields** (string)\n- **lists** (string)\n- **list_fields** (string)\n- **cards** (string)\n- **card_fields** (string)\n- **card_attachments** (bool)\n- **card_attachment_fields** (string)\n- **customFields** (bool)\n- **card_customFieldItems** (bool)\n- members (bool)\n- member_fields (string)\n- organization (bool)\n- checklists (string)\n- checklist_fields (string)\n- labels (string)\n- actions (string)\n- action_fields (string)\n- actions_limit (number)\n\nAll boolean parameters can assume ``true`` or ``false`` and the string parameters either ``all``, ``none`` or (some) a comma-separated value list of fields to show. For example:\n\n``https://trello.com/b/o2tmzJAw/test.json?fields=none&lists=all&list_fields=name&cards=all&card_fields=desc,idList,name``\n\n... shows up like this:\n\n```json Trello JSON (shortened)\n{\n  \"id\": \"63a871b59e3b200022455381\",\n  \"cards\": [\n    { ... },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"63a8586e7de45d0fc54d0d39\",\n      \"desc\": \"Kate shows us how to create a tree view as collapsible list, created using only html and css, without the need for JavaScript\",\n      \"idList\": \"63a8585dc0c10c020ca9ea03\",\n      \"name\": \"Tree views in CSS\"\n    },\n    { ... }\n  ],\n  \"lists\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"63a997ab23684f02303a0525\",\n      \"name\": \"Discoveries INBOX\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"63a8585dc0c10c020ca9ea03\",\n      \"name\": \"Discoveries: CSS\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nImportant to now here is, that most of the data are NOT hierarchially structured, like Board > List > Cards, but in parallel. You have to pick the id of a list to filter the cards array by it. The same with custom fields inside a card: it holds a reference to the custom field list only.\n\nFor the attachments of a card, Trello distinguishes between URL's and files. The attribute ``bytes`` is null for URLs and the URL itself is in name. Files, on the other hand, have ``bytes`` greater than 0 and a specific ``mimeType``, while images additionally have up to seven different ``previews`` in the widths 70, 150, 250, 300, 600 and original. Very handy for my case, since I always scale down my screenshots to 600 pixels.\n\n``https://trello.com/b/o2tmzJAw/test.json?fields=none&lists=all&list_fields=name&cards=all&card_fields=desc,idList,name&card_attachments=true&card_attachment_fields=bytes,mimeType,name,previews&customFields=true&card_customFieldItems=true``\n\n```json ... card item in Trello JSON (shortened)\n{\n  \"id\": \"63a8586e7de45d0fc54d0d39\",\n  \"desc\": \"Kate shows us how to create a tree view as collapsible list, created using only html and css, without the need for JavaScript\",\n  \"idList\": \"63a8585dc0c10c020ca9ea03\",\n  \"name\": \"Tree views in CSS\",\n  \"attachments\": [\n  {\n    \"bytes\": null,\n    \"mimeType\": \"\",\n    \"name\": \"https://iamkate.com/code/tree-views/\",\n    \"previews\": [],\n    \"id\": \"63a8586e7de45d0fc54d0d5b\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"bytes\": 225271,\n    \"mimeType\": \"image/png\",\n    \"name\": \"Screenshot_20221225-121537.png\",\n    \"previews\": [\n      { ... },\n      {\n        \"_id\": \"63a8586e7de45d0fc54d0d58\",\n        \"id\": \"63a8586e7de45d0fc54d0d58\",\n        \"scaled\": true,\n        \"url\": \"https://trello.com/1/cards/63a8586e7de45d0fc54d0d39/attachments/63a8586e7de45d0fc54d0d52/previews/63a8586e7de45d0fc54d0d58/download/Screenshot_20221225-121537.png\",\n        \"bytes\": 111574,\n        \"height\": 499,\n        \"width\": 600\n      },\n      { ... },\n    ],\n    \"id\": \"63a8586e7de45d0fc54d0d52\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## The Generator\n\nFirst of all: This generator has NOTHING to do with Hexo's build-in [generators](https://hexo.io/api/generator.html). It's just a Node script, which produces MD files that later on will be processed by Hexo into posts!\n\nWhat should he do:\n\n1. Download Board JSON from Trello\n2. Iterate through ``lists`` to find the one to process\n3. Iterate through ``cards`` to find all referencing the chosen list\n4. Create new POST object to store all needed information\n5. Process all found cards...\n   1. Create new ITEM object to store all needed information\n   2. Store TITLE, generated KEY out of TITLE, DESCRIPTION in ITEM\n   3. Resolve AUTHOR from ``customfields`` for ITEM\n   4. Iterate through card ``attachments``\n   5. Store URL in ITEM, when its a link\n   6. Generate IMAGENAME out of KEY and store in ITEM, when its an image\n   7. Create new POST.FOLDER for the images\n   8. Download image from attachment URL into POST.FOLDER as IMAGENAME\n   9. Add ITEM to POST.ITEMS\n6. Get photograph for new post (kiko.io special, see {% post_link 2020/Automatic-Header-Images-in-Hexo %})\n   1. Store PHOTOGRAPH information in POST\n7. Generate new post via Handlebars template\n8. Store new post\n\nThe goal is that I only need to write an introduction and adjust a few frontmatter variables before generating and publishing the post.\n\n### Settings\n\nFirst task is to save the possible settings in Hexo's default configuration file:\n\n```yaml\n# Trello Discoveries Generator Script\ndiscoveries:\n  board:\n    url: https://trello.com/b/D6zIhLus/collections.json\n    parameters:\n    - key: fields\n      value: name\n    - key: lists\n      value: all\n    - key: list_fields\n      value: name\n    - key: cards\n      value: all\n    - key: card_fields\n      value: closed,desc,idList,name\n    - key: card_attachments\n      value: true\n    - key: card_attachment_fields\n      value: bytes,mimeType,name,previews\n    - key: customFields\n      value: true\n    - key: card_customFieldItems\n      value: true\n  template: discoveries.handlebars\n```\n\n### Template\n\nNext step is creating a [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template out of my scaffold file I used so far:\n\n```hbs\n---\nslug: {{{key}}}\ntitle: '{{{title}}}'\nsubtitle:\ndate: {{{date}}}\nphotograph:\n  file: {{{photograph.file}}}\n  name: {{{photograph.name}}}\n  link: {{{photograph.link}}}\n  socialmedia: /static/images/social-media/{{{key}}}.png\nseries: Discoveries\ncategories:\n  - Misc\ntags:\n  - Collection\nrelated:\n  - Discoveries-xx\n  - Discoveries-yy\n  - Discoveries-zz\nsyndication:\n  - host: Mastodon\n    url: \n---\n\nINTRODUCTION...\n\n{% anchorlist \n{{#each items}}\n  \"{{{title}}}|{{{key}}}\"\n{{/each}}\n%}\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n{{#each items}}\n{% discovery \"{{{title}}}\" \"{{{author}}}\" \"{{{url}}}\" {{{../key}}} {{{imageName}}} %}\n{{{description}}}\n{% enddiscovery %}\n{{/each}}\n```\n\n### Generator Script\n\nNext, the generator itself, which lives in ``/lib/scripts/``. It is implemented as a class with CommonJS and takes two parameters in the constructor for defining the number of the Discoveries post to create and the name of the Trello list, where the data for this should come from. It's main function is ``generate``, which starts the generation. Here's the skeleton:\n\n```js discoveries-generator.js\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\nconst yaml = require('js-yaml');\nconst path = require(\"path\");\nconst axios = require(\"axios\");\nconst handlebars = require(\"handlebars\");\nconst { marked } = require('marked');\n\nclass Generator { \n\n  let _config;\n  let _trelloUrl;\n  let _templateFile;\n\n  // Init new post object\n  let _post = {\n    board: null,\n    list: null\n  };\n\n  constructor(discoveryNo, listName) {\n    // Init the generator and gather all necessary data for running it\n  }\n\n  generate() { \n    // Run the generator\n  }\n\n  async downloadImage(url, item) {\n    // Helper for downloading the images asynchronously  \n  }\n\n  createPostFromTemplate() {\n    // Helper for creating the post's MD file out of the template\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\n**At this point I will refrain from reproducing the complete code here. Just follow this [link](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/kiko.io/blob/cb9ba3f9157771231258834b156bb6aead2cd229/lib/discoveries-generator.cjs) ...**\n\nHowever, a few points in the implementation are important to consider:\n\n1. The downloads are performed by means of the promise based HTTP client [axios](https://axios-http.com/). I can only recommend this thing...\n\n2. The image downloads are initially collected in a Promise list for subsequent execution, while iterating through the cards of the selected Trello list\n\nThe script is actually really straight forward, but I have some improvements in mind, which will find their way into the code later on:\n\nA. If an image is missing, create a proper screenshot via Puppeteer\n\nB. Introduce a top most card(s) for the INTRODUCTION, a SUBTITLE and some additional TAGS, to avoid having to rework the new post before publishing\n\nC. Automated insertion of the RELATED posts, based on the last three Discoveries issues\n\n### Run it ...\n\nThe easiest way to get the generator running, is to create a simple runner script:\n\n```js _run_discoveries-generator.cjs\nconst Generator = require(\"./discoveries-generator.cjs\").Generator;\n\nconst discoveryNo = process.argv[2].toString();\nconst listName = process.argv[3].toString();\n\nconst generator = new Generator(discoveryNo, listName);\ngenerator.generate();\n```\n\nThe execution in the console then is just a one-liner:\n\n``node \"./lib/_run_discoveries-generator.cjs\" \"<NUMBER>\" \"<TRELLO-LISTNAME>\"``\n\n---\n\nIt was fun to write this automation during Christmas.

The latter is not as straightforward as I would like it to be, especially because I have different devices in use that require different approaches. The main purpose of this post is to simply write down for me, how things currently work on kiko.io and to have one or the other idea how to do it better while writing. Doing this publicly is in the hope that you might read this and have a terrific idea that I haven't come up with yet and leave a comment or webmention ... :)\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n---\n\n## Hexo ...\n\nI don't have experience with other SSGs like Hugo or others, so I can't make comparisons, but I can share a few things about Hexo that have kept me engaged in my work with Hexo. I won't go into the general functionality of Hexo here, but the ones that interest me most for my particular needs. A more or less good start into the tool is [https://hexo.io](https://hexo.io) with its DOCS and API.\n\nOne of the first commands you get to know is ``generate``, which generates the static HTML pages from the MD files stored in the ``source/_posts`` folder. You can add your own [generators](https://hexo.io/api/generator), which can generate any other custom pages, to this process and put them under ``themes/<your-theme/scripts`` for automatic execution. Every generator has a ``locals`` argument, which holds all site variables, including a list of all posts.\n\nUnfortunately, the documentation at [hexo.io/api](https://hexo.io/api/) is rather poor and so only after a while I realized, that a custom generator is called relatively late in the process, when the MD files have long since been preprocessed. So you can process any MD files in a generator, but you have to do without the automatic processing of the powerful [Tag Plugins](https://hexo.io/docs/tag-plugins) or syntax highlighting, because this takes place in an upstream [processor](https://hexo.io/api/processor), which deals with [boxes](https://hexo.io/api/box).\n\nI don't understand Hexo's concept at this point. For me it is not particularly catchy and straightforward. Unfortunately a few help-, discussion- and example pages are written in Chinese, since the creator Tommy Chen is from Taiwan, as I guess, but my Chinese really sucks... ;)\n\nThe best thing about Hexo in general is, that you can get your first results quickly after the basic installation, so you are able to concentrate on writing and prettying things up for a while. Only when the requirements increase is it necessary to take a closer look at the insufficiently documented substructure. A challenge even for experienced web developers, but unfortunately absolutely impossible for beginners...\n\n---\n\n## Posts\n\nHexo is based on a structure of posts and pages, where posts can be aggregated in various ways, whether in the time-based archive or via tags and categories. Posts has to have a specific structure, regarding the Frontmatter in the MD file and teh storage of attached images. Hexo offers the user a separate command for this: ``hexo new``, which works with template files in the folder ``scaffolds``.\n\nFor the presentation of my posts, I decided to incorporate my passion of photography by assigning a unique header image to each post (and most pages). How I implemented this, I have described in the article {% post_link 2020/Automatic-Header-Images-in-Hexo %}. The main point is, when I create a new post, I automatically and randomly pick a photo (in the three media-dependent versions *normal*, *tablet* and *mobile*) from a pool, copy the images to the appropriate delivery folder and bind it to the new post via frontmatter. For this I've written the Hexo event hook ``on-new-get-photo-for-post.js``, which runs on the command ``hexo new post \"<title-of-new-post>\"``.\n\nWorks great, except for the fact that I'm often on the go and using a Node.JS-powered command towards an SSG project hosted on GitHub definitely doesn't work on an Android smartphone. So, how do I get it to create a new post remotely?\n\nFirst part of the answer, regarding access to all project files, was to store the project in a folder that is synchronized with one of the usual suspects: Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive. With this, I have access to the entire project at all times on all devices that can sync the files. In the case of Android with the help of one of the [Autosync apps from metactrl](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=metactrl+%22autosync%22&c=apps).\n\nThe second part of the answer, regarding execution of the new post command, was a bit more difficult, but part of my solution was to use my little home server, where the project also syncs and which is always switched on. Problem here: This tiny box is not publicly available on the web and never will be. Therefore the only communication channel I had, was file synchronization and the solution was to use a simple text file to hold the commands I want to be executed. For this purpose, I have written a small command line tool that runs and processes a modified command file when it is received. For file monitoring I have [SyncBackPro](https://www.2brightsparks.com/syncback/sbpro.html) in use, which has the incredibly useful feature of being able to execute commands before and after a synchronization takes place, in this case my tool, which I have named **HexoCommander** and whose source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/HexoCommander).\n\n{% alertbox note %}\nBefore you think \"*What the hell is he doing? That's what* [fill in the Linux tool of your choice] *is for*\" ... I'm more of a Windows guy. Linux means something to me, but I've never worked with it and never had to ... and yessss, there is a career in IT also with Windows ;)\n{% endalertbox %}\n\nThe advantage of synchronizing the whole GitHub project via cloud storage service is that I also host **kiko.io** on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and that a commit to the repository on GitHub automatically triggers a deployment, which I don't always want right away. So, because of my changes to the post process, I don't use Hexo's built-in drafts, but write on a new post until I'm done and then release by committing to GitHub.\n\n{% thinkbox \"IS THERE AN EASIER WAY?\" %}\nI admit that on an Android smartphone, it's a bit fiddly to write a special command to a text file and then wait 2 or 3 minutes for the file to sync, the new line to be read and executed, and the new post files to sync back to the smartphone, but it works. But I would rather have a smartphone capable interface, where I can enter my data and the whole thing runs at the push of a button.\n\nCurrently I have no idea how to achieve this in a static site environment. Do you have one?\n{% endthinkbox %}\n\n---\n\n## [Photos](/photos)\n\nAs I speak from photos ... to provide header images for my new posts (or pages), I have prepared a pool of photos that I display on a special filterable page. This page is not one that comes with Hexo, but is based on a dynamic page generator I've created for this purpose. I wrote about it in 2021: {% post_link 2021/Pattern-for-dynamic-Hexo-pages %}.\n\nBut how do I fill this pool with new photos, especially because I need three variants of a new photo for the standard device classes Desktop (normal), Tablet and Mobile?\n\nI have a very specific workflow in Lightroom to edit my photos and convert them from RAW to JPEG while exporting, to add them to [my 500px collection](https://500px.com/p/kikon) for example. The destination of these export is again my cloud storage.\n\nFrom time to time I pick some images from these export folders that I want to use on the blog. I do this mostly on my Android smartphone in a quiet minute and these are the steps and Android apps I need, to turn a high resolution 10MB photo into one that can be used on the web:\n\n1. [Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2): Creating a new folder in the projects pool folder with the name of the image.\n2. [Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2): Copy the original photo into the new pool folder.\n3. [Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2): Create `meta.txt` to hold the name and the 500px Url of the photo in the new pool folder.\n4. [ImageSize](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.vsmedia.imagesize): Create normal (1280px), tablet (768px) and mobile (480px) versions of the photo as web images.\n5. [Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2): Copy web images to new pool folder and delete original.\n\nI have a similar workflow working on my Windows machine, but both workflows are manual ones.\n\n![kiko.io's Photos Workflow](The-State-of-the-Blog/kiko-io-PHOTOS.png)\n\n{% thinkbox \"IS THERE AN EASIER WAY?\" %}\nFiddling around with images on the smartphone like this almost has a medidative effect on me, but it's not really effective. Better would be to throw the original image into a folder and let Hexo do the work of resizing by utilizing [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) and [imagemin](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin).\n{% endthinkbox %}\n\n---\n\n## [Series](\\series) & [Projects](\\projects)\n\nRelatively soon it was clear to me, that I want to aggregate posts to series and I didn't want to use the integrated categories or tags for it. It should be working with a new frontmatter attribute called ``series`` with the value of a slug of a referencing MD file, which provides some text to describe the series. *Projects* is basically a index like series, but merely works with a different Frontmatter attribute.\n\nThe whole thing was made possible by **Levi Wheatcroft**'s work on his plugin *hexo-index-anything*. Unfortunately Levi stopped working on it a long time ago and so I forked it under the new name [hexo-generator-anything](/projects/hexo-generator-anything/). The generator is controlled by a section in Hexo's configuration file, which defines the EJS layout file to render the main index page respectively the index pages of each series, beside a mapping list for the appropriate Frontmatter variable and the output path:\n\n```yaml _config.yaml\nanything:\n  layout_index: anything-index\n  layout_posts: anything-posts\n  index_mappings:\n    - variable: series\n      path: series\n    - variable: project\n      path: projects\n```\n\n![kiko.io's Series Workflow](The-State-of-the-Blog/kiko-io-SERIES.png)\n\n{% alertbox info %}\nTag Plugins and syntax highlighting for code blocks in the reference MD files are not resolved actually, because it is a generator only (see first section 'Hexo...').\n{% endalertbox %}\n\n---\n\n## [Tiny-Tools](/collections/tiny-tools)\n\nSince this blog is primarily a memory aid for me and my future self (how often do I have stumbled across my own posts during web search), it was logical to place a special bookmark collection here, because it happened to me more often that I found and used an online tool and some time later wonder what the thing was called when I have the same requirement again. \n\nThat's why I started to collect these URL's in a public Trello board (see {% post_link 2020/Add-website-to-Trello-card-the-better-way %}) and provide them with keywords and a screenshot. But Trello is a Kanban tool and not designed for such special requirements as the display of bookmarks and so I use it only as a data source for my page TINY-TOOLS.\n\nGenerating a static page out of Trello cards was again a job for my dynamic pages, I had introduced for the photos page. It takes advantage of the fact that any Trello board can be retrieved as machine-readable data by extending the url with `.json`. The [Dynamic Trello Generator](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/kiko.io/blob/26ccfa18b8abff279a05b1f12363992a278c130c/themes/landscape/scripts/generator-dynamic-trello.js) is really straight forward.\n\nWith this script it is only a matter of configuration to generate a page from a given list of a board (URL ist shortended):\n\n```yaml\ntrello:\n  boards: \n  - name: Collections\n    url: https://trello.com/.../collections.json?fields=all&cards=all&card_fields=all&card_attachments=true&lists=all&list_fields=all\n    pages: \n    - name: tiny-tools\n      list: TinyTools\n```\n\n![kiko-io's Tiny Tools Workflow](The-State-of-the-Blog/kiko-io-TINY-TOOLS.png)\n\n{% thinkbox \"IS THERE AN EASIER WAY?\" %}\nCan't imagine one. Do You?\n{% endthinkbox %}\n\n---\n\n## [Notes](/notes)\n\nThe Notes section is the latest and with it I want to follow the POSSE principle, i.e. \"Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere\", which is a vital part of the IndieWeb movement. So when something comes to mind that I want to post on Mastodon for example, I want it to end up in a new Note MD file that is then posted, preferably automatically.\n\nFor me, notes differ from normal posts. From the beginning I wanted to present them chronologically connected on one page per year, like a diary, and not to mix them with the articles (posts). So a standard treatment as a Hexo post was out of the question and I had to come up with something of my own. Another reason not to work with the standard structures of Hexo was, that I did not want to create a subfolder with the name of the post for images as usual in Hexo, but one folder for all images of a year.\n\nSince I am familiar with Hexo generators, I built a new one called ``generator-notes`` that iterates through the entire ``source/_notes`` folder and generates an index file for all the notes in a year, as well as the notes file itself, and copies the images to the source path.\n\nThis approach also freed me from using my HexoCommander, because there is no need of executing a ``new xxx`` command. I can now create new Notes from the smartphone quite easily:\n\n1. [Autosync App](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=metactrl+%22autosync%22&c=apps): Synchronization of the source/notes folder\n2. [Markor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.gsantner.markor): Edit or create new Note MD file via snippet.\n3. [GitHub PWA](https://github.com): Upload MD file to the appropriate folder of the repository\n\nThe upload will automatically trigger the build and deployment to GitHub. Done.\n\n![kiko.io's Notes Workflow](The-State-of-the-Blog/kiko-io-NOTES.png)\n\n{% thinkbox \"IS THERE AN EASIER WAY?\" %}\nUsing a generator directly means, that I can't use tag plugins in my Notes and code blocks won't be prettied up, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nAlso the Notes are not included in the Hexo ``Locals`` and are therefore not available later on for RSS feeds or other stuff to create. So I will probably extend my approach with a custom [Hexo processor](https://hexo.io/api/processor.html), that will allow me to do this.\n{% endthinkbox %}\n\n---\n\n## Deployment\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, kiko.io is hosted at GitHub Pages. Due to a bug in Hexo regarding the treatment of non markdown files in post folders ([Fix #1490](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/pull/4781)), I had to process all files locally and transfer the output folder to the repository as well. I would have liked to use a GitHub action for the entire deployment, including the generation of the output files, but for a long time there was no NPM package with a working Hexo version that would have allowed this.\n\nI recently checked again to see if the current Hexo release 6.0.3. had fixed my bug and the subsequent bugs .... and yes. With one or two workarounds, my Hexo installation now runs completely on NPM packages, without any manual adjustments!  \nSo I could finally switch the deployment and automate it with its own [build action](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/kiko.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/hexo-build.yml). This enables me to write a text on the go, commit the file via github.com and the build and deployment starts. Woohoo ... \\o/\n\n{% thinkbox \"IS THERE AN EASIER WAY?\" %}\nNope. The only drawback I see is that this approach always generates the entire site and not just the newly added posts, as is the case locally. It's a bit of a waste of time and computing resources.\n{% endthinkbox %}\n\n---\n\n## Syndication\n\nAs I'm a fan of the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), I started early with [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) on my blog. The idea behind it is to mention an article from blog A in a post on Blog B or social media like Twitter or Mastodon and blog A gets an automated message like \"_Hey, I've mentioned you here_\". The operator of Blog A can now also automatically display this message under the article mentioned.\n\n### Receiving Webmentions\n\nkiko.io is a static site, therefore, there are no active components on the web server that could react to an incoming webmention. But that's not a problem, because there are services like [webmention.io](https://webmention.io) that can serve as recipients and from where you can then pick up the messages. Some bloggers do this by fetching and inserting them into the articles while generating the static pages, but for me this can take too long. My approach is, to load the mentions from webmention.io via JavaScript dynamically into the page, as described in my post {% post_link 2021/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Receiving-Webmentions %}.\n\n{% thinkbox \"IS THERE AN EASIER WAY?\" %}\nI don't think so...\n{% endthinkbox %}\n\n### Sending Webmentions\n\nUnfortunately a I can't integrate sending Webmentions for the mentioned Url's in a particular (new) post into the generation process while building the static files for the blog, because the target Url's not yet exist at this point of time. I have to wait until it is deployed and thus publicly available. So this step is currently still a manual one.\n\nMy current solution is based on Remy Sharp's NPM package [@remy/webmention](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remy/webmention), which he himself also uses for his web service  [webmention.app](https://webmention.app/). I integrate it into a Hexo console command called \"console-webmention\" which I call via ``hexo webmention``. Without parameters, the last post is searched for outgoing url's and their webmention endpoints respectively. See the [project page](/projects/hexo-console-webmention/) for more details.\n\n{% thinkbox \"IS THERE AN EASIER WAY?\" %}\nThis works so far, but depending on a console application means once again having to use my HexoCommander and write commands to a text file when I'm on the road. Then I can also send the webmentions for a post directly manually via the **[Telegraph](https://telegraph.p3k.io/)** service.\n\nOne possibility would be a cron job in a Github Action, but this would require creating a new container with all dependencies every time the build has just run and Github has deployed the created files, just to run a console command that might not even return any results since there is nothing to mention in the last post. Unsatisfactory.\n\nAnother possibility would be to utilize my Atom feed by setting up a Zapier, IFTT or Make/Integromat task, which picks the last added entry and run the [Telegraph API](https://telegraph.p3k.io/api) against it.\n\nAny ideas?\n{% endthinkbox %}\n\n### Publish on Mastodon\n\nI'm relatively new to Mastodon (Nov 22), but in the past I have syndicated some of my posts manually on Twitter. Now, that I've said goodbye to the greedy bird site, I'm thinking about how I'm going to automate publishing the notes in particular, but also at least an excerpt from a post, on Mastodon.\n\nWhat I do in the meantime? After the site is successfully deployed, I open up my Mastodon client and copy the complete content of a note or write an excerpt of a post manually into a new toot and append the permalink. After hitting SEND, I copy the newly created Mastodon post URL into a Frontmatter attribute called `syndication` of the note or post and commit the file to GitHub. Build and deployment runs again and the syndication link will be visible on kiko.io.\n\n![kiko.io's Syndication Workflow](The-State-of-the-Blog/kiko-io-SYNDICATION.png)\n\n{% thinkbox \"IS THERE AN EASIER WAY?\" %}\n\nThe Mastodon API is really simple and there are many examples written in Python, JS and other languages out there that are easy to adapt. But here I have the same problem as when sending webmentions: the target url is not yet available at the time of generating the page, when some code is running to do something. It must be a downstream task as well. I need some kind of service running on a server, where I only have a static site. Independent GitHub Action or Azure Function, triggered by a webhook after deployment is finished, which processes all notes and posts without the `syndication` Frontmatter? Or extending HexoCommander again, but how to trigger this buddy automatically, as he depends on file synchronization?\n\n{% endthinkbox %}\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nHexo is a good SSG system with which you can achieve good results in a short time and which leaves enough room for your own creative ideas. The documentation needs a lot of improvement, especially regarding the details in depth and enriched with examples. I'm not surprised that Hexo seems to lag behind other systems like Hugo or 11ty. Maybe this also have something to do with communication. It's not as much of a conversation in the Western space as others. In the future, I have planed to be more involved in matters of documentation and communication, even though I have not yet understood the full complexity of the substructure.\n\nHowever, I enjoy working with Hexo despite or because of the shortcomings. Coding without a challenge is like driving on a highway ... boring :)\n\nMy workflows are currently not really straightforward, especially with regard to connectivity. However, this is also due to the fact that there are no reactive components working on \"my\" web server.\n\nIt's all still way too much tinkering, but it will be fun over the next few months to edit all the remarks in the \"IS THERE AN EASIER WAY?\" blocks above and continue to develop the blog.\n","tags":["Hexo","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Mastodon simply explained","url":"/post/Mastodon-simply-explained/","content":"\nThis weekend I had a revival experience. I got myself a [**Mastodon**](https://joinmastodon.org/) account, after many years of staying away from social media as far as I could and at most tweeting a new blog post. Since my active Twitter days, things have taken such a turn for the worse, that I've preferred to stay away completely.\n\nI don't know what made me join Mastodon on Sunday, but it sparked something in me: The love for the good old internet of the late 90s, early 2000s. These guys gave me a warm welcome and made me feel that Internet communities, away from sleazy influencers and banner ads, could actually still work. I got a taste of it, when I let this blog become part of IndieWeb over a year ago, but didn't quite believe in it because of the low traffic and mentions.\n\nNow the richest man on the planet has to come along and buy the bird site, and a niche product called Mastodon, well known but underestimated in tech circles, almost explodes under the onslaught of disappointed commercial users. And that's what we are on Twitter, Facebook and Co ... a commercial object.\n\nThe problem now will be how the community can integrate these many users for whom it was not mentally prepared. What now adapts to whom? The most important thing, however, will be to teach the newcomers (and I count myself among them) that Mastodon is not Twitter in new clothes!\n\nI was going to write a few things about this, but this morning I read a Twitter thread from [**Peter Jakobs**](https://mastodon.green/@pjakobs), a self-proclaimed digital Aboriginal from Germany, that just sums it all up and explains it so well I could hardly do it:\n\n[![Tweet from Peter Jakobs, November 29, 2022](Mastodon-simply-explained/tweet-peter-jakobs-22-11-09.png)](https://twitter.com/pjakobs/status/1590276045521195008)\n\nThat's why I'm now doing something I've never done before: I quote Peter here completely, translated from German into English ... Curtain up (and thank you [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator) :D):\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n{% blockquote_alt \"Peter Jakobs\" \"https://twitter.com/pjakobs/status/1590276045521195008\" %}\nKeyword \"Mastodon for Twitterer\" 🧵\n  \nI've now read from a few of you that Mastodon is too complicated, you've had problems, or you somehow don't like it.  \nAs a stone age Twitterer (I created this account on Feb 13, 2007), I have by now half of my activities to Mastodon. Many of my posts you see here now come from there and I mostly come here to respond to your replies.\n\nSo it is possible for an old white guy like me to move, and maybe I can ease some of your fears and help with the move.\n  \nYou ask why you should and that almost nothing has changed here (yet)?\n  \nMaybe, but the signs on the wall don't bode well. Elon Musk is, if you look at it neutrally, someone who destroys things in order to rebuild them - better, in his sense.  \nBut that means change is coming. It will disturb you here, but it will come here maybe not in one fell swoop like a move to Mastodon.\n\nI'm always a friend of bringing about change myself, because then I can shape it in my own way and am not dependent on others. \n\nBut it could be that you will still like Twitter in 12 or 18 months. I know this myself, my Twitter experience is by no means as negative as many others say.  \nBut many others, like me, go a different way, and are thus no longer accessible here.\n\nBut that is exactly one of the biggest disadvantages of Twitter and one of the advantages of Mastodon.\nLet me explain.\n\nMany write that they are confused by these \"instances\" (some say \"groups\" which is not quite true) on Mastodon.  \nI can understand that, it can be confusing. But what if I told you that **there is also an instance on Twitter, but just exactly one**. Twitter.com namely. This one can't communicate with anything or anyone else, an island in the middle of a vast social media ocean. And now this island has been stupidly bought by someone whose idea of what such an island should look like is rather special.\n\n**Mastodon has many such islands and they are connected with bridges.**\n\nYou choose an island, pitch your tents there and - you are not tied to this island. On the one hand you can communicate completely freely with all inhabitants of all other islands, on the other hand you can, if you want to, **take down your tents again and move to another island** (you will lose a little bit, but not as much as if you want to leave here [at Twitter]). These islands (instances) are of different sizes. The biggest ones in Germany are [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social), [troet.cafe](https://troet.cafe), [mastodon.green](https://mastodon.green) and a few others. But there are also tiny islands, I know more than one with a single inhabitant. Is he isolated on his island? No, because he is connected with all the others via said bridges.\n\n**Every island has one (or more) chiefs who keep order** (Twitter does too, but we've complained about that a lot). These chiefs are often private individuals who run an instance as a hobby, but with the large instances there is usually a team behind it, and some also a small company ([mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social), for example, is run by a limited liability company that was founded by the chief developer of the Mastodon software, [mastodon.green](https://mastodon.green) is, as far as I know, a one-man limited liability company).\n\nSo now we know that there are many islands, that we are not trapped on these islands and that we can move.\nThese islands are one of the standout features of Mastodon: **a Musk, a Trump, or even a certain four-letter newspaper can buy an island or even build an island themselves, but they can't possibly buy all the islands, simply because it's so cheap to build new islands.** (I read somewhere once, to run an instance costs about 1€ per user per month). But because the interesting thing about Twitter, like Mastodon, is not the medium itself, but the networks we build on it, it doesn't matter what happens to individual islands as long as we can move freely.\n\n**If individual islands do not want to comply with the rules at all, then they are \"defederated\"**, or figuratively: the bridges there are demolished. However, this is the decision of each individual island chief, so it may not be grassroots democracy, but it is distributed.  \n\nOk pjakobs, enough of the chatter, how am I supposed to find out which island is suitable for me?  \nHere is a searchable list of Mastodon instances: [instances.social/list](https://instances.social/list#lang=de&allowed=&prohibited=&min-users=&max-users=)\n\nIt is possible that another aspect of the \"island\" image will apply to you: there is a local timeline on the islands, which is also called that. So, if you choose an island that is particularly suited to a geographical region, a topic or a language, then you will see the contributions of the other \"inhabitants of this island\" in their local timeline - which hopefully have a certain thematic cohesion. However, as already mentioned, you can follow all people on all instances and you will also see them in your own timeline.\n\nSpeaking of timelines: they are chronological and you only see the posts (toots) of those you follow. **No algorithm, no \"others like this too\", no good morning tweets in the late evening. Just the way Twitter used to be 10 years ago.**\n\nFollow: here is one of the points that bothers me the most, even if it is a small thing. Currently there are two software versions of Mastodon in use: 3.5.3 and four, which seem to handle following a bit differently.\n\nIn one (I assume the older version), if you want to follow an account on another instance, you have to specify your own handle again (in my case \"@pjakobs@mastodon.green\" - but that's no longer the case in the new version, there you **click a follow button and you follow the account**.\n\nAnother thing that is very very different is DMs. Here on Twitter, we're used to DMs essentially working like little emails or a messenger: we have our own inbox and that's where the dialogue with the other person shows up. Feels good, not visible to others, because yes, in a completely different realm.\n**In Mastodon, direct messages are simply toots that are displayed only to the recipient(s)** - and normally among all the other interactions.\n\nIt's confusing and doesn't feel as nicely protected as it does here, and as I walked around town a bit yesterday I realized: this is intentional. Twitter creates an apparent privacy through display that DMs don't offer.  \n**DMs are deliberately not PM, not private messages.** Mastodon also makes that clear through its presentation. I have therefore added my Threema and Telegram link to my profile, these tools actually offer private conversations. Is not comfortable but honest.\n\nYou have created an account, but do not want to move 100% yet or, as in my case, still have many friends on this site? There is also a kind of \"bridge\" from Mastodon archipelago to Twitter. You can mirror your tweets to Mastodon or vice versa. This is only valid for tweets, not for replies. That means you have to be a bit careful that you don't just spam your followers in the other network, but also interact with them. After a few days of mirroring from Twitter to Mastodon I turned the bridge around, today probably 80% of the tweets you see from me and the non-replies are on Mastodon. I use [crossposter.masto.donte.com.br](https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br) for this.\n\nThe lovely people from [@digitalcourage](https://twitter.com/digitalcourage) not only run a Mastodon instance themselves, but also put together a [great overview](https://digitalcourage.de/digitale-selbstverteidigung/fediverse) of the Fediverse (the federated social media universe, which is much more than just Mastodon).\n\nIn summary, if Musk is really fucking this up, you don't have to be a helpless victim of his actions. Even if Mastodon might not be an alternative for you at the moment, create an account, try to find your followers over there. \n\nA life raft is not as comfortable as a floating boat, but it's better than a sinking boat!\n\nAh, here's another more complete overview of Mastodon: \n[the-federation.info/mastodon](https://the-federation.info/mastodon) (takes a little while to load)\n\n{% endblockquote_alt %}\n\nYou will find Peter Jakobs on this island: [@pjakobs@mastodon.green](https://mastodon.green/@pjakobs).\n\nMy new social media residencies are: [@kiko@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@kiko) for Tech Stuff in English and [@kiko@hessen.social](https://hessen.social/@kiko) for politics and society in German.\n\n**Happy Tooting !**","tags":["Publishing","Social Media"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Syndicate Mastodon Hashtags in your favorite Feed Reader","url":"/post/Syndicate-Mastodon-Hashtags-in-your-favorite-Feed-Reader/","content":"\nOk, I admit it: I read RSS feeds.

Unfortunately, the app itself didn't get any of this because there was no communication channel for them to talk.\n\nIf you research this topic on the web, you have to dig through many architecture pages and documentations that have one thing in common: sometimes they just don't get to the point. So here are my 50 cents on the subject and my sample implementation.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Preliminary Thoughts\n\nIn most examples I've read, the authors talk about code for the app itself and code for the Service Worker, but that falls short to me, because in my opinion there are THREE parts:\n\n1. The **App**\n2. The **Service Worker**\n3. The **Service Worker Management**, which takes care of the proper registration and installation of the service worker\n\nThe last part of the code shouldn't be part of the app itself, in the meaning of SoC (Seperation of Concerns). It does not contribute to the functioning of the app.\n\n---\n\n## The App\n\nHere's the general anatomy of my App:\n\n```js app.js\nvar app = {\n  'settings': { // some stuff on app settings\n    ...\n  },\n  'pages': { // views of the SPA\n    ...\n  },\n  'ui': { // some UI helper\n    'dialog': function(msg, title) {\n      // show the message in a toast, popup or elsewhere\n    }\n  },\n  'starter': {\n    'init': { // initializing of the app\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nwindow.app = app;\napp.starter.init();\n```\n\nNothing unlikely, as I guess. It is built according to the composite pattern and has one entry point, that is called at the end of the file after it is instantiated.\n\n---\n\n## The Service Worker\n\nThe Service Worker lives in its own JS file and its implementation is really straight forward:\n\n```js service-worker.js\nvar cacheName = 'my-apps-cache-v1.2.3';\n\nvar appFiles = [\n  // list of app relating files, that has to be handled\n]\n\nvar excludeUrls = [ \n  // list if URL's that shouldn't be handled\n]\n\nself.addEventListener('install', function(e) {\n  // on install, open the cache and add all appFiles\n  ...\n  \n  //activate immediatly and dont wait for connected clients to disconnect\n  self.skipWaiting();\n}\n\nself.addEventListener('activate', function(e) {\n  // remove old caches\n\n  //say to all clients: Now I'm responsible\n  self.clients.claim();\n}\n\nself.addEventListener('fetch', function(e) {\n  // intercept requests and serve the app files out of the cache\n}\n```\n\nI won't go into the depth of my implementation here now, since it doesn't matter for the message exchange. It is only good for you to know that I have versioned the cache name to exchange it with new versions.\n\n---\n\n## The Service Worker Management\n\nNow the management code for the Service Worker. It has to be loaded with the app code, because it is client code and later on it needs knowledge of the app.\n\n```js sw-management.js\nif('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js')\n    .then(function(registration) {\n\n      // detect Service Worker update available\n      registration.addEventListener('updatefound', function() {\n\n        if (registration.installing) {\n\n          // detect install of new Service Worker\n          registration.installing.addEventListener('statechange', function() {\n\n            if (registration.waiting) {\n\n              if (navigator.serviceWorker.controller) {\n                // there is an existing controller that has been updated\n                //TODO: Send a message to the app\n              } else {\n                // first install\n              }\n\n            }\n\n          }\n        }\n\n      }\n\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Lets Communicate...\n\nIn this setup, the communication code can be implemented. Let's do it as a round trip.\n\n### 1. Client sends message to Service Worker\n\nAs ``sw-management.js`` represents our Service Worker management code, we add a little function to send a message in here:\n\n```js sw-management.js\nfunction sendMessageToServiceWorker(type, msg) {\n  if (navigator.serviceWorker.controller) {\n      navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage(\n        {'type': type, 'msg': msg }\n      );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe define a type for the purpose of our communcation and a message itself. The function can be called wherever, like this:\n\n```js\nsendMessageToServiceWorker(\"TEST\", \"Hey, Service Worker\");\n```\n\n### 2. Service Worker receives the message\n\nIn the Service Worker code we need to add a recipient:\n\n```js service-worker.js\nself.addEventListener('message', function(event) { \n  if (!event.data) return;\n  \n  if (event.data.type === 'TEST') {\n    // do something regarding to the type and/or with the message\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. ... and sends a message back to the client\n\nWhat we want to do with the message depends what we want to achive, but in this example, just let's greet back:\n\n```js service-worker.js\nfunction sendMessageToClients(type, msg) {\n  // as the SW can control multiple clients, we have to catch them all\n  self.clients.matchAll({ includeUncontrolled: true })\n      .then(function(clients) {\n          for (const client of clients) {\n              client.postMessage(\n                {'type': type, 'msg': msg }\n              );\n          }\n      });\n}\n\nself.addEventListener('message', function(event) { \n  if (!event.data) return;\n  \n  if (event.data.type === 'TEST') {\n    sendMessageToClients(event.data.type, 'Hi Clients...');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Client receives the answer from the Service Worker\n\nIn order to get messages from the Service Worker, we have to implement a receiver in the client also:\n\n```js sw-management.js\nif('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n\n  //... 'navigator.serviceWorker.register' stuff\n\n  navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener('message', function(event) {\n    if (event.data) {\n        // do something with the message from the Service Worker\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 5. ... and shows it in the app\n\nAs I pointed out earlier, that the management code has to be loaded alongside with the app code, it's a breeze to show the message:\n\n```js app.js\nvar app = {\n  ...\n\n  'ui': { // some UI helper\n    'dialog': function(msg, title) {\n      // show the message in a toast, popup or elsewhere\n    }\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n\nwindow.app = app;\n...\n```\n\n```js sw-management.js\nif('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n\n  //... 'navigator.serviceWorker.register' stuff\n\n  navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener('message', function(event) {\n    if (event.data) {\n        app.ui.dialog.info(event.data.msg, 'Service Worker says...');\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## The Update Message\n\nWith this infrastructure, everything is there to show a message, when the Service Worker is updated:\n\n```js sw-management.js\nif('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js')\n    .then(function(registration) {\n\n      // detect Service Worker update available\n      registration.addEventListener('updatefound', function() {\n\n        if (registration.installing) {\n\n          // detect install of new Service Worker\n          registration.installing.addEventListener('statechange', function() {\n\n            if (registration.waiting) {\n\n              if (navigator.serviceWorker.controller) {\n                // there is an existing controller that has been updated\n\n                app.ui.dialog.info('New version installed', 'Service Worker');\n\n              } else {\n                // first install\n              }\n\n            }\n\n          }\n        }\n\n      }\n\n    }\n\n  ...\n\n}\n```\n\nImportant to point out, that the Service Worker side of the communication is not involved in this case, because only the client-side management code knows when a new version has to be installed.\n\n---\n\n## More Info\n\n{% moreinfo '{ \"list\": [\n  [ \"Jake Archibald\", \"The service worker lifecycle\",\n  \"https://web.dev/service-worker-lifecycle/\" ],\n  [ \"Demian Renzulli & Andrew Guan\", \"Two-way communication with service workers\",\n  \"https://web.dev/two-way-communication-guide/\" ],\n  [ \"Adam Bar\", \"Handling Service Worker updates – how to keep the app updated and stay sane\",\n  \"https://whatwebcando.today/articles/handling-service-worker-updates\" ],\n  [ \"Felix Gerschau\", \"Service Worker Lifecycle Explained\",\n  \"https://www.peterkroener.de/postmessage-zwischen-service-worker-und-clients/\" ],\n  [ \"Felix Gerschau\", \"How to communicate with Service Workers\",\n  \"https://felixgerschau.com/how-to-communicate-with-service-workers/\" ],\n  [ \"Peter Kröner\", \"PostMessage zwischen Service Worker und Client(s) (GERMAN)\",\n  \"https://www.peterkroener.de/postmessage-zwischen-service-worker-und-clients/\" ]\n]}' %}\n","tags":["SPA","PWA"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Discoveries #20 - CSS & UI","url":"/post/Discoveries-20-CSS-UI/","content":"\nWeb interfaces are unthinkable without CSS.

However, operating multiple computers with one input set requires tools, for example one from the Microsoft Garage.**\n\nThe trend is toward second or third devices, especially among IT workers. In addition to the stationary computer, which may still be under the desk, there is a laptop and possibly a tablet. All of them are connected to cloud services. If the desk is large enough, there may be two monitors and a full-size keyboard connected to the desktop, the laptop on the left, on which two or three special programs are installed, and the Surface tablet on the right for communication with its narrow-track keyboard. And spread out on the table are three mice in different colors so as not to constantly get the wrong one. A scenario that the author of these lines was also confronted with ... yes, until a few years ago a small tool for Microsoft Windows fell in front of his feet, which abruptly ended the input chaos: Mouse Without Borders.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nMicrosoft, like many IT corporations, encourages its employees to create side projects, which then either eventually find their way into one of the main products or are released under the [Microsoft Garage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/) banner. This is also the case with the work of **Truong Do**, a Microsoft employee from Washington, who deals with Microsoft Dynamics in his daily business. He was probably also fed up with the numerous input devices and developed a tool more than 10 years ago with which the mouse pointer of a Windows device can be moved across its own monitor border to another device, whereby one of the keyboards is then activated on the device on which the mouse pointer is currently located.\n\nThe startup is simple:\n\n1. Download tool via [http://aka.ms/mm](http://aka.ms/mm)\n2. Make sure that all devices are available on the same network\n3. Run the installation program on all devices\n4. From one device, link the other devices using the security code generated by the program\n5. Arrange the devices on the desktop in the program by dragging and dropping them from their locations\n6. Done\n\n![Mouse Without Borders - Setup](One-mouse-to-rule-them-all/mouse-without-borders-setup.png)\n\n![Mouse Without Border - Options](One-mouse-to-rule-them-all/mouse-without-borders-options.png)\n\n## Other features\n\nBesides the main purpose of sharing mouse and keyboard across multiple devices, you can also set up a shared clipboard (Share Clipboard) and make it possible to copy files from one computer to another via drag & drop (Transfer File). This creates a special folder on the desktop of the target computer, where these files end up via the clipboard. It is also useful that the user does not become a long-distance pusher when the pointer is on the far right device and he has to go to the far left, because where it stops on the right, it continues on the far left.\n\nFor keyboard lovers, Truong Do has made keyboard shortcuts available for each linked device, with a choice of F-keys or numbers. All machines can also be locked at once via Ctrl-Alt-L. If the connection hangs once, a spirited Ctrl-Alt-R helps to get them all back on track.\n\nAs an extra goodie, Truong Do has included a narrow-gauge screenshot capture, but you can safely turn it off, because it can't compete with tools like [Brian Scott's Cropper](https://github.com/brhinescot/Cropper) or [Greenshot](https://github.com/greenshot/greenshot), but rather hinders because it uses common keyboard shortcuts.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYes, multiple large monitors and classic remote solutions like RDP or TeamViewer help to operate multiple machines at the same time, but when you have the zoo of devices physically together, working with Mouse Without Borders feels like having four or more monitors, with the advantage that the individual machines don't have to give up any of their performance. The nice thing, too, is that it doesn't matter at all what version of Windows is running on the devices. Everything from Windows 7 upwards is supported.","tags":["Windows","Workflow","Remote"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Creating Icon Font from SVG Files","url":"/post/Creating-Icon-Font-from-SVG-Files/","content":"\nA several years ago I started building a little PWA and chose [Bootswatch 3.3.5.](https://bootswatch.com/3/) for theming. As it depends on Bootstrap I was able to use the [icons from Bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/). At the beginning I needed only a handful of these icons, but with the time it became more and more difficult to find the right one, because the Bootstrap Glyphicons in version 3 included only around 250 icons and there was not always the right one. Also, the app was always lugging around well over 100 KB of extra files, of which I actually only needed a few kilobytes.\n\nIn another project I had used [Fontello](https://fontello.com/), where you can build and download your own icon font from a selection of available icons. Very nice, but I didn't feel like fiddling with project-specific configuration files on the Fontello website. But since you could upload your own SVG files in Fontello, which were then taken over into the font, the same had to work somehow with a Node.JS plugin!?\n\nAnd yes [gulp-iconfont](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-iconfont) from [Nicolas Froidure](https://github.com/nfroidure) was exactly what I needed.\n\n![gulp-iconfont on GitHub](..\\Creating-Icon-Font-from-SVG-Files/gulp-iconfont.png)\n\n---\n\n## First Solution\n\nJust copy a bunch of SVG files in a folder, run gulp and there was my own customized icon font with a tolerable size of around 20 kilobytes. At that time, [Thomas Jaggi](https://github.com/backflip) had taken care of the creation of a CSS file with the correct code points that matched the font with his tool [gulp-iconfont-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-iconfont-css).\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Setup\n\nFirst I needed some SVG files...\n\n```md\n|-- Images\n    |-- SVG\n        |-- alert.svg\n        |-- cancel.svg\n        |-- delete.svg\n        |-- email.svg\n        |-- flag.svg\n        |-- link.svg\n```\n\n... and the NPM packages of my task runner [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/):\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-iconfont\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-iconfont-css\n```\n\nFor generating the CSS file a template called ``_icons.css`` is shipped with the NPM package of **gulp-iconfont-css**, which can be customized as needed. In my case I just made a copy into a folder called ``Templates``, where I store all other template files I need for my PWA.\n\n```CSS Templates/icons-template.css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"<%= fontName %>\";\n  src: url('<%= fontName %>.eot');\n  src: url('<%= fontName %>.eot?#iefix') format('eot'),\n       url('<%= fontName %>.woff2') format('woff2'),\n       url('<%= fontName %>.woff') format('woff'),\n       url('<%= fontName %>.ttf') format('truetype'),\n       url('<%= fontName %>.svg#<%= fontName %>') format('svg');\n}\n\n.<%= cssClass %>:before {\n  font-family: \"<%= fontName %>\";\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-variant: normal;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  text-transform: none;\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n}\n\n<% _.each(glyphs, function(glyph) { %>\n.<%= cssClass %>-<%= glyph.fileName %>:before {\n  content: \"\\<%= glyph.codePoint %>\";\n}\n<% }); %>\n```\n\nAs I was using Gulp for building my app, I had to integrate a new task for creating the icon font in the ``gulpfile.js``:\n\n```JS /gulpfile.js\nvar iconfont = require('gulp-iconfont'),\n    iconfontCss = require('gulp-iconfont-css');\n\nvar distFolder = 'Build';\nvar fontName = 'MyAppIcons'; \n\ngulp.task('create-iconfont', function(){\n  return gulp.src(['Images/SVG/*.svg']) \n    .pipe(iconfontCss({\n      fontName: fontName, \n      path: 'Templates/icons-template.css',\n      targetPath: fontName + '.css',\n      fontPath: distFolder\n    }))\n    .pipe(iconfont({\n      formats: ['svg', 'ttf', 'eot', 'woff', 'woff2'],\n      fontName: fontName, // Required\n      fontHeight: 1001,\n      normalize: true,\n      prependUnicode: true, // Recommended\n      timestamp: Math.round(Date.now() / 1000) // Recommended\n    }))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(distFolder));\n  });\n\ngulp.task('build', \n  gulp.series(\n    'create-iconfont'\n    // other gulp tasks\n  )\n);\n```\n\nI little explanation on that ... First of all the task for **gulp-iconfont-css** has to be inserted before piping the files through **gulp-iconfont**, in order to create the CSS file properly. Following options were used:\n\n#### gulp-iconfont-css\n\n|Option|Description|\n|---|---|\n|``fontName``|Name that the generated font will have |\n|``path``|Path to the template for generating CSS file|\n|``targetPath``|Path where the CSS file will be generated|\n|``fontPath``|Path to the icon font file|\n\n#### gulp-iconfont\n\nThe library combines some other projects such as [svgicons2svgfont](https://github.com/nfroidure/svgicons2svgfont), [gulp-svgicons2svgfont](https://github.com/nfroidure/svgicons2svgfont#svgicons2svgfontoptions) and [gulp-svg2ttf](https://github.com/nfroidure/gulp-svg2ttf) to create the different font formats, because its just a wrapper around them.\n\n|Option|Description|\n|---|---|\n|``formats``|Font file formats that will be created|\n|``fontName``|Name of the font (for *svgicons2svgfont*)|\n|``fontHeight``|Minimum height on scaling icons|\n|``normalize``|Normalize icons by scaling them to the height of the highest icon (for *svgicons2svgfont*)|\n|``prependUnicode``|Prefix files with their automatically allocated unicode code point (for *gulp-svgicons2svgfont*)|\n|``timestamp``|Get consistent builds when watching files (for *gulp-svg2ttf*)|\n\n### Output\n\nAfter running ``gulp build`` all files needed were generated:\n\n```md\n|-- Build\n    |-- MyAppIcons.css\n    |-- MyAppIcons.eot\n    |-- MyAppIcons.svg\n    |-- MyAppIcons.ttf\n    |-- MyAppIcons.woff\n    |-- MyAppIcons.woff2\n```\n\n```CSS MyAppIcons.css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"MyAppIcons\";\n  src: url('MyAppIcons.eot');\n  src: url('MyAppIcons.eot?#iefix') format('eot'),\n       url('MyAppIcons.woff2') format('woff2'),\n       url('MyAppIcons.woff') format('woff'),\n       url('MyAppIcons.ttf') format('truetype'),\n       url('MyAppIcons.svg#MyAppIcons') format('svg');\n}\n\n.icon:before {\n  font-family: \"MyAppIcons\";\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-variant: normal;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  text-transform: none;\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n}\n\n.icon-alert:before {\n  content: \"\\E001\";\n}\n\n.icon-cancel:before {\n  content: \"\\E002\";\n}\n\n.icon-delete:before {\n  content: \"\\E003\";\n}\n\n.icon-email:before {\n  content: \"\\E004\";\n}\n\n.icon-flag:before {\n  content: \"\\E005\";\n}\n\n.icon-link:before {\n  content: \"\\E006\";\n}\n```\n\nAll I had to do now, was to reference the new CSS file in my HTML and decorating my HTML tags with one of the new ``icon``-classes. Yes! My had my own icon font, just by copying some SVG files in a folder...\n\n### The Problem\n\nA while later, as my app grew, I needed some new icons, but in the meantime I had used the content codes elsewhere in static CSS files, for example with other pseudo-selectors like AFTER.\n\n```CSS style.css\n.my-special-link::after {\n  font-family: \"MyAppIcons\";\n  content: \"\\E006\";\n}\n```\n\nAfter copying a few new icon files to the SVG folder and running the build, I found that most of the icons didn't fit anymore!?\n\nAfter a short research it was clear to me what had happened. With the insertion of the new SVG files, the order of the files in the folder was changed. But since the libraries processed this folder in alphabetical order, file by file, and simply incremented the codes to be assigned, the codes had simply shifted.\n\nIn the example above, this can be easily understood if we insert a file named **cloud.svg** here. The code for *cancel.svg* (``E002``) remains untouched, but *cloud.svg* now gets ``E003`` and *delete.svg* ``E004`` and so on. The hardwired icon for ``.my-special-link`` (``E006``) now showed instead of the link icon a flag icon.\n\n---\n\n## Newer Solution\n\nI don't know when this happened, because I don't keep a constant eye on my little PWA and thus the further development of the related tools, but after having manually adjusted the moved codes two or three times now and once again wanting to change a few things on the PWA's icons, I had enough and came across the following sentence on the gulp-iconfont-css page on GitHub:\n\n{% blockquote_alt \"backflip (Thomas Jaggi)\" \"https://github.com/backflip/gulp-iconfont-css\" %}\nRecent versions of gulp-iconfont emit a glyphs (or codepoints < 4.0.0) event (see docs) which should likely be used instead of the workflow described below. However, it will continue to work as expected.\n{% endblockquote_alt %}\n\nAhh, ok. I don't need the **gulp-iconfont-css** anymore. I can create the CSS file by myself. Lets see how the **gulp-iconfont** task looks, after rewriting:\n\n```JS /gulpfile.js\nvar iconfont = require('gulp-iconfont');\n\nvar distFolder = 'Build';\n\nvar fontObj = {\n  fontName: \"MyAppIcons\",\n  cssClass: \"icon\"\n};\n\ngulp.task(\"create-iconfont\", function () {\n  return gulp\n    .src([\"Images/SVG/*.svg\"])\n    .pipe(\n      iconfont({\n        fontName: fontObj.fontName,\n        fontHeight: 1001,\n        formats: [\"svg\", \"ttf\", \"eot\", \"woff\", \"woff2\"],\n        normalize: true,\n        prependUnicode: true,\n        timestamp: Math.round(Date.now() / 1000),\n      })\n    )\n    .on(\"glyphs\", function (glyphs, options) {\n\n      fontObj.glyphs = glyphs.map(mapGlyphs);\n\n      console.log(fontObj, options);\n\n      gulp\n        .src('Templates/icons-template.css')\n        .pipe(consolidate(\"lodash\", fontObj))\n        .pipe(rename({ basename: fontObj.fontName }))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(distFolder));\n    })\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(distFolder));\n});\n\nfunction mapGlyphs(glyph) {\n  return {\n    fileName: glyph.name,\n    codePoint: glyph.unicode[0].charCodeAt(0).toString(16).toUpperCase(),\n  };\n}\n\ngulp.task('build', \n  gulp.series(\n    'create-iconfont'\n    // other gulp tasks\n  )\n);\n```\n\nFirst I have introduced a new ``fontObj`` variable to hold all informations for the untouched CSS template. The major difference is now, that ``iconfont`` is the only main task, with a subtask where the glyphs are processed directly via [``consolidate``](https://www.npmjs.com/package/consolidate). The ``mapGlyphs()`` function ensures that the file names with the CodePoints are transferred into an easily usable structure.\n\nWorks fine, but doesn't solve my problem with the shifted CodePoints, when inserting new SVG icons ... but someone remarked in a StackOverflow article to have a look at the test files of *gulp-iconfont*. **There, the SVG files carry as prefix the name of the CodePoints to be used for this file!**. Unfortunately, this feature is not documented, but it works...\n\n```md\n|-- Images\n    |-- SVG\n        |-- uE001-alert.svg\n        |-- uE002-cancel.svg\n        |-- uE003-delete.svg\n        |-- uE004-email.svg\n        |-- uE005-flag.svg\n        |-- uE006-link.svg\n        |-- uE007-cloud.svg\n```\n\nNow the order of the SVG files doesn't matter anymore. I just copy a new SVG file into the folder and rename it with a currently unused Unicode.\n\n---\n\n## Upcoming Solution: Using SVG Sprites\n\nInterestingly, the inventor of **gulp-iconfont** page writes on the GiHub page:\n\n{% blockquote_alt \"Nicolas Froidure (nfroidure)\" \"https://github.com/nfroidure/gulp-iconfont\" %}\nWarning: While this plugin may still be useful for fonts generation or old browser support, you should consider using SVG icons directly. Indeed, when i created gulp-iconfont and all its related modules, using SVG icons was just not realistic for a wide browser suppport but i was already conviced that SVG was the future, that's why i wanted my SVG source files to sit separated in a folder. So, now, just enjoy switching to SVG with almost no effort :). Was a great open source journey with you all!\n{% endblockquote_alt %}\n\nThis goes along with some older articles of Chris Coyer from CSSTricks:\n\n* https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/\n* https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/\n* https://github.com/w0rm/gulp-svgstore\n\nMaybe it's time to say goodbye to icon fonts completely and use SVG files directly, but in my opinion this is not suitable for all needs. Especially if you work a lot with pesudo selectors, a general rebuild of the code and the UI will be necessary and you would do well to weigh the cost-benefit carefully.\n","tags":["Bundling","SVG","Font"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Dopamine, a music player for Windows 10 as it should be","url":"/post/Dopamine-a-music-player-for-Windows-10-as-it-should-be/","content":"\nThere are about fourleventy millions music apps for smartphones running Android and iOS. However, most of them are relatively junk or try to foist malware on users. You have to make sure that you separate the wheat from the chaff. On the other hand, the situation is surprisingly different for Windows, the much older operating system. The older ones of us will still remember the glorious WinAmp times, whose current owner Radionomy has been making a very long new attempt for a new version 6 since 2018 (version 5.8 is already a handsome 6 years old), but you can actually count the good music players for Windows 10 and higher on one hand, if you subtract the streaming apps such as Spotify and Co. and disregard everything that comes along as a jack of all trades and can ALSO play MP3. The best known are the in Windows included and miserably failed iTunes clone from Micosoft called **Groove**, **[AIMP](https://www.aimp.ru/)**, **[foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/)**, **[MediaMonkey](https://www.mediamonkey.com/)** and **[MusicBee](https://www.getmusicbee.com/)**. Some nostalgic people might also add the good old [Windows Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287), which managed to survive on the net despite Groove. If you look at the download pages of these music player candidates and try to look behind the business model, some of them simply do not download. One or the other player also overdoes it with the featuritis. Bouncing balls or bars to the music are gimmicks that were thought to be outdated long ago, when it is actually only about listening to music.\n\nBelgian software developer **Raphaël Godart** ([twitter.com/RaphaelGodart](https://twitter.com/RaphaelGodart)) must have felt the same way a few years ago when he set out to launch his own player for local MP3 collections, which in this case sounds falsely commercial because his player **[Dopamine](http://www.digimezzo.com/software/)** is freely available on GitHub and open source under GPL 3.0 license. It plays music under a plain and simple, yet chic interface ... Period. Everything a music lover's heart desires is on board:\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n- Automatic reading of a folder configured at the beginning.\n- Display of the collection by artist, genre, album, title or folder\n- Playlist management\n- Light and dark theme, including setting the accent color\n- Interface in 30 languages\n- Integration with taskbar and notification bar\n- Automatic updates\n\n{% image_slide\n  \"dopamine2.png|Dopamine 2.0.9 on Windows 10\"\n  \"dopamine2-playlist.png|Dopamine 2.0.9 Playlist\"\n  \"dopamine2-settings.png|Dopamine 2.0.9 Settings Page\"\n %}\n\nThe design of the application is instantly convincing. Everything is limited to the most necessary, an accent color and a lot of white e.g. gray space, so that not only the ear feels comfortable with the music, but also the eye. And all this at a very good speed and nicely animated transitions from one view to another.\n\nBesides the basic ability to play MP3 files, the author has also included a rudimentary, but well-functioning editing function of the MP3 metadata. Furthermore, any star assignments or added lyrics are stored directly in the file and not just in the SQLite database behind it.\n\n![Dopamine 2.0.9 Edit MP3 Metadata](Dopamine-a-music-player-for-Windows-10-as-it-should-be/dopamine2-edit.png)\n\nHowever, Godart has also included a few useful things from the Featuritis department in its program. On the one hand, it downloads information from last.fm about the currently played artist and you can scrobble there if you like, and on the other hand, it scans some lyric collections for the lyrics, which unfortunately rarely works.\n\nQuite unique is one of the most recently added features: a blacklist! Yes, many an album of a favorite musician contains a track that he would have been better off sparing himself. Such pieces can now be specifically hidden, so that the musical enjoyment is not spoiled.\n\n## Further development\n\nNew releases of Dopamine 2 since version 2.0.8 are not as frequent as before, because the program is basically developed out and Raphaël only adds smaller features, translations and bugfixes. Instead, 4 years after the release of the first version two years ago, he has embarked on a completely new development with version 3. Where Dopamine up to version 2 was developed with Microsoft C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), the latest will be based on Electron, Angular and Typescript, i.e. packaged web technology (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) for all operating systems and not just Windows. Currently, Godart has reached Preview 10, which has by far not the same scope of the previous version, but is already running stable.\n\n![Dopamine 3 under Electron](Dopamine-a-music-player-for-Windows-10-as-it-should-be/dopamine3.png)\n\n## Music in the cloud\n\nIf you're on the go and have stored your music on a cloud service like Microsoft's OneDrive, you might pay attention to the fact that on a device connected to it, the entire collection is not downloaded, but only selected parts in order to save local storage space. Microsoft makes it easy for users there: it displays all OneDrive files in Windows Explorer with 0 bytes of space used and only downloads them when they are accessed or when the user selects *Always keep on this device* in a folder's context menu. This works quite beautifully with Dopamine 2. It, with support from C# and the operating system, simply ignores all those files that are not available on the disk in real terms when scanning the specified music folder. Dopamine 3, on the other hand, in which the scan must take place via Node.js and the ``fs.readdir()`` method, immediately triggers the download function of OneDrive and you unintentionally fill up your disk.\n\n## Curiosity on the side\n\nRaphaël's C#/WPF solution weighs 76 MB when installed, 2.5 MB of it for the executable, the new Electron-based one under Windows, however, already 302 MB, with the EXE being a whopping 128 MB. If you take a look at the code base, this becomes even more obvious: while the Windows-only version comes along with 760 files, the new Electron version already contains 86,092 files in 7,948 folders with a total weight of almost one gigabyte after running ``npm install``! Once again you can see that platform independence in the brave new Node.JS world is often bought with heavy weight. This is mainly due to the necessity (or the unkindness, depending on how you look at it) to drag along thousands of dependent libraries (dependencies), which occasionally only bring a string to a certain width or something similarly trivial. Not to mention the problems with depublicated or malware-infested dependencies, which have recently upset large parts of the community.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDopamine 2 is a really fantastic music player for Windows that simply outshines most others due to its simplicity and well-done interface. Let's see if Godard manages to do something similar with version 3 and Electron. It's a challenge, but he seems to be a full-blooded developer.

The company from Redmond has done quite a lot right with the tool and has gathered a large group of open source developers around it (currently 1,640 contributors), who contribute to the fact that the Swiss Microsoft team around Erich Gamma can bring out a new release for Windows, Linux and macOS every few weeks.\n\nIt all started with the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), the core around which VS Code is built and which was first released on April 14, 2016. The exciting thing about Monaco and VS Code is, that it is consistently written using web technologies, i.e. HTML, CSS and Javascript, packaged and executed using the framework [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) developed by GitHub, which in turn is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the open source browser engine [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) from Google.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nIt is not really surprising that the developers have built a really good editor from the start, which could directly defy the first Chromium-based tool [Brackets](https://brackets.io/) from Adobe at that time, because Erich Gamma was the head of the development environment [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/) for many years and therefore knows about the needs of the worldwide developer community. Surprisingly however is already, that although VS Code is based on Web technologies, it took some years, until the editor made it out of its Electron cardboard, directly into the Browser. For example, it wasn't until 2020, 2 years after Microsoft acquired GitHub, that they announced [github.dev](https://github.dev/), which is just a call target for the newly introduced **Magic Dot** and opens a project hosted on GitHub in the browser. For those who like to try it out, just go to any GitHub repository and hit the DOT key and the project will open in a VS Code browser window. A variant of this is [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/), which can open not only GitHub projects, but any from your own hard drive.\n\nHowever, both browser editors have one thing in common: you can code wonderfully on the go, but you cannot start the projects and thus also not validate your own code for executability. The substructure is missing and is therefore not a real IDE. No pre-processing via Grunt or Gulp, no starting web server or similar, simply because there is no console that could communicate with the operating system. However, Microsoft has also announced another tool in 2020 that is supposed to bring exactly this substructure via cloud container: [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). Beta access has been expanding for a few weeks now, and it should be available for team and enterprise cloud plans starting in August.\n\n## Cloud-based development environment from Kiel, Germany: Gitpod\n\nA team around Sven Efftinge and Anton Kosyakov from the beautiful city of Kiel, asked themselves the question why not build an online development environment back in 2017 and launched the project Theia under the umbrella of the Eclipse Foundation. The idea was to develop a remote-first IDE that runs both locally and in the browser and fully supports the numerous VS Code extensions already available. They named the actual product around Theia **Gitpod** ([gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/)). Although there are still numerous Theia solutions available today, such as Eclipse Che, Stackblitz or the Google Cloud Shell Editor, Gitpod decided to move to the VS Code platform in late 2020 after Erich Gamma and his team provided [Remote Support in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview), on which github.dev is based, among others.\n\nHowever, since Microsoft had decided not to open source the server component for the time being (the commercial GitHub CodeSpaces sends its regards), Anton, by his own account, created a first working version of the [Open VSCode Server](https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server/) in 4 days, which was released in [September 2021](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/openvscode-server-launch). Not a month later, Microsoft also made its own server solution freely available, but with a few restrictions, among other things, regarding the extensions that can be obtained from Gitpod via the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/) portal, since the [Microsoft Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) is reserved for Microsoft's own products.\n\n![Open VSX Registry](Gitpod-Visual-Studio-Code-on-the-Web/open-vsx-registry.png)\n\n## The name and the technology behind it\n\nThe name **gitpod** already tells us something about the technology behind the service. 'git' stands for the file management system behind the editor and 'pod' for the server technology under the editor.\n\n### git...\n\nNowadays, source code is (hopefully) no longer just stored locally on a hard disk, but centrally and managed by source code management software. The current gold standard in this area is the free [Git](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) initiated by Linus Torvalds in 2005, a distributed version management that forms the basis of popular developer platforms such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket.\n\n### ...pod\n\nA short step back in time: It's not so long ago that IT'ers called an environment on which they published a server application *machines*, because it first needed hardware with processor, main memory, hard disks and an operating system of choice, which was then installed and on that in turn the said application.\n\nHowever, if the server application was only used sporadically, the expensive hardware was underutilized, i.e. resources were wasted. To solve this problem, work began in the 1970s on virtualizing hardware so that several logically separate systems could share the hardware to increase its utilization. Any operating system and the required server applications can be installed and operated in each of the [virtual machines (VM's)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuelle_Maschine) created in this way.\n\nIn this concept, however, there are redundancies in the form of the operating system. If, for example, you want to run 5 Linux-based web servers, you will also have to loop along 5 possibly identical Ubuntu installations that want to be maintained.\n\n[Docker](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(Software)) is not the only, but most well-known software that addressed this problem in 2013 by abstracting another layer, in this case the operating system. Here we are now no longer talking about a machine or VM, but a container in which the server application runs. For the orchestration of these containers, the software [Kubernetes](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes) initiated by Google has been available since 2015, in which the smallest deployable unit is called a **pod**, which contains one or more containers that share the allocated resources.\n\nSuch a pod with a ready installed and configured Open VSCode Server is launched on Google Cloud Platform when a user opens a Gidpod Workspace.\n\n## Let's go ... Starting a Gitpod Workspace\n\nIn Gitpod, you launch a project hosted on Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket into a so-called workspace. To do this, simply prepend the url of your repository with the string **gitpod.io/#**.\n\nThose who prefer buttons, can either use a provided [bookmarklet](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-bookmarklet) and resort to a [browser extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension) that adds a Gitpod button to the Github interface.\n\n![Gitpod Chrome Extension](Gitpod-Visual-Studio-Code-on-the-Web/gitpod-extension.png)\n\nOnce the workspace has been started and you have closed the browser window, it will be available for a while on the dashboard under **Workspaces**. If you work frequently with the same project, it is advisable to create a permanent shortcut there under **Projects** if you are not into manual url changes or buttons. Last but not least, the icing on the cake is to install one of these Gitpod projects as a Chrome App and drop it in the toolbar. That way, the code is just a click away and the whole thing almost feels like a local VS Code due to the reduced browser window.\n\n![Creating a Gitpod project as a Chrome App](Gitpod-Visual-Studio-Code-on-the-Web/gitpod-window.png)\n\n![Launched project in Gitpod](Gitpod-Visual-Studio-Code-on-the-Web/gitpod-pwa.png)\n\n## Configuration of the workspace of a project\n\nIn addition to the general setting options, Gitpod offers an individual configuration per project. For this the file **.gitpod.yml** is searched in the root of the project folder and used. All setting options are well documented in the [gitpod Docs](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/gitpod-yml).\n\n### Using a custom container\n\nThe default container that Gitpod boots up when starting a workspace is based on Debian/Ubuntu and already includes a lot of frameworks and languages like Node, Java, Go, Python and some more. However, if you want to use a different image, you can set this via the **image** entry, either by referencing a public image or by specifying the name of a Dockerfile in the project. The possibilities here are numerous and can be found in the section [Custom Docker Image](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-docker).\n\n### Tasks at startup\n\nTo get a project running in Visual Studio Code, especially in the Node environment, there are a few things that need to be set up, such as installing the correct Node.js version and dependent packages using NPM or another package manager. The same is true for Gitpod, of course, although these actions need to be done again and again after the working environment has been started, for example, if the pod has been discarded after a while. For these recurring tasks, the software provides the [Tasks section](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-start-tasks) in the **.gitpod.yml** and there, in the forefront, the **init** entry. In the following example, Node 14.17, all local packages and one global package are installed as a multi-line task:\n\n```\ntasks:\n  - init: |\n      nvm install 14.17.2\n      npm install\n      npm install -g grunt-cli\n```\n\nWith the grouping and naming of tasks, the terminal display settings and the total of three execution levels **before**, **init** and **command** it is easy to create a configuration that starts up the workspace in a fixed way while keeping an overview.\n\n![Start of a Github project in Gitpod with project-own configuration](Gitpod-Visual-Studio-Code-on-the-Web/easingsnet-gitpod.png)\n\nIf you like it even a bit faster, you can use so-called [Prebuilds](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/prebuilds), which serve as a snapshot for creating a new workspace. These prebuilds use the **.gitpod.yml** of the project and are closely linked to the source code management used (currently GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket). Thus, a prebuild is recreated each time modified code is checked into the project. It doesn't get much faster and more convenient to code from anywhere in the browser.\n\n![Gitpod Prebuild via Github](Gitpod-Visual-Studio-Code-on-the-Web/prebuild.png)\n\n### Include extensions automatically\n\nWhen creating the gitpod workspace, the configuration file **.gitpod.yml** can also be used to include the Visual Studio code extensions that are needed for working. The easiest way to do this is if the extension is represented on the open platform [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org), because gitpod looks for the pattern ``${publisher}.${name}`` there by default.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nvscode:\n  extensions:\n    - HookyQR.beautify\n    - kamikillerto.vscode-colorize\n```\n\nHowever, VSIX files from other sources can also be included via the full url. Microsoft offers with the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) the primary and largest source of extensions, but unfortunately omits the specification of a complete download path of the VSIX file. However, it is very easy to build this using the following pattern:\n\n``https://${publisher}.gallery.vsassets.io/_apis/public/gallery/publisher/${publisher}/extension/${extension}/${version}/assetbyname/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.VSIXPackage``\n\nThe necessary information about the variables *Publisher*, *Extension* and *Version* in this pattern can be obtained from the details page of an extension in Visual Studio Code.\n\n![Extension detail page in Visual Studio Code](Gitpod-Visual-Studio-Code-on-the-Web/vscode-hexo-utils-details-page.png)\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nName: vscode-hexo-utils\nId: fantasy.vscode-hexo-utils\nDescription: vscode extension for hexo\nVersion: 0.2.1\nPublisher: fantasy\nVS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fantasy.vscode-hexo-utils\n```\n\nThis will result in the following entry in **.gitpod.yml**:\n\n```\nvscode:\n  extensions:\n    - https://fantasy.gallery.vsassets.io/_apis/public/gallery/publisher/fantasy/extension/vscode-hexo-utils/0.2.1/assetbyname/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.VSIXPackage\n```\n\n## Synchronize settings\n\nEvery IDE looks different, depending on the tastes and preferences of the developer sitting in front of it, and so relatively quickly after the first release of VS Code, there were the first extensions that could synchronize the IDE's settings across multiple machines (mostly via Gists), until Microsoft took on the feature and integrated it directly into the IDE. Now, with Gitpod, we have a new but slightly different instance of Visual Studio Code, but the Kielers thought of that, too. They couldn't access the data of the integrated synchronization, but they created a by-pass with their own extension that works just as well.\n\nAfter the installation in VS Code and a restart of the same, one logs in to the extension with the same account under which one has registered with Gitpod and can thereafter synchronize tasks, code snippets extensions and keyboard shortcuts in addition to the settings.\n\n![Gitpod VSCode extension to synchronize settings](Gitpod-Visual-Studio-Code-on-the-Web/gitpod-vscode-extension.png)\n\n## Prices and Services\n\nGitpod is a company and has to look like all others, how it can work cost-covering. Therefore, as is often the case, there are different plans that can be booked. There are four of them at Gidpod in the Saas area, whereby Free differs from the other plans only in the possible computing time, the timeout and the parallel running workspaces. Thus, in the Free plan, there are 50 hours that you can work with 4 WorkSpaces and in case of inactivity, the pods are shut down again after 30 minutes. A fair free offer for all those who want to code on the go, but most of the time have a computer and a locally installed VS Code.\n\nYou can also host Gitpod yourself on an existing managed Kubernetes environment, for example if you are already a customer of cloud service providers like Amazon, Azure or Google.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt will be exciting to see to what extent Microsoft's own GitHub CodeSpaces will be able to hold its own against this really very manageable opponent once it has been launched en masse. The team from Kiel has at least already set the bar very high, also because it is fantastically documented and structured. A real gain for every tool collection.\n","tags":["VS Code","GitHub","Remote"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Discoveries #19 - Visual Helpers","url":"/post/Discoveries-19-Visual-Helpers/","content":"\nColors and images are the visual meat on the boil of any web solution.

But the [WayBackMachine](https://web.archive.org/web/20111116021952/http://www.zerbit.de/projekte/outlooksignature.aspx) says something different. Started in 2006, I released the last version 1.9 at the beginning of December 2008. Just 14 years ago...\n\n![OutlookSignature on zerbit.de ten years ago](zerbit-outlooksignature.png)\n\nThe thing was a command line tool, that could be used to automatically generate signatures for Microsoft Outlook in the three formats TXT, RTF and HTML, for example centrally via a Windows login script for the entire organization. No hassle anymore for the users on creating an appropriate mail signature and no more stress for the marketing department in enforcing a uniform appearance. It was based on templates with placeholders for the data and configurable via an INI file. The data could come either from the ActiveDirectory via LDAP or from any database.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nI had quite a large fan base and even years later I kept getting requests to integrate new features. The problem I faced after releasing the last version 1.9 in 2008 was on the one hand that Microsoft had fundamentally changed the handling of signatures in Outlook and on the other hand that VB6 was no longer really en-vogue, because everybody (and me too) was switching to VB.NET or C# and that would have meant a complete re-write for me. But there were already commercial alternatives to OutlookSignature at that time and I had turned to other projects, but it was available into 2012 until I decided to close my personal blog. However, to this day there are [one](https://www.outlook-stuff.com/tipps-tricks/problemloesungen/717-einheitliche-outlook-signaturen-zentral-im-firmennetz-verwalten.html) or [two](https://moximo.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/automatische-outlooksignaturen-mit-informationen-aus-der-ads/) websites where you can download or find information about it.\n\nOutlookSignature was always freeware, but never Open Source, because of the fact, that I used some code, that did not come from me and was not approved for publication.\n\n## Accidental Discovery of a Go-based Implementation\n\nI own the domain *zerbit.de* until today and the other day I was looking on the web for some references to it and stumbled across a GitHub page with the title [**An open source reimplementation of Kristof Zerbe's (ZerbIT) \"OutlookSignature\"**](https://github.com/foobar0815/gosignature) ...

It works only with LDAP, which is quite enough today.\n\nI have no idea about Go, but I will certainly look into it a bit in the near future and find out if this thing works.

Would be fun to talk about it...\n\n:)","tags":["Mail","Office"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Simplest Console File Logger","url":"/post/Simplest-Console-File-Logger/","content":"\nWhen you need to do a task in IT and don't need a fancy user interface, you usually turn to a console application or develop one. But no UI means not, that you don't want to get some information about the status of the running program. The means of choice in C#/.NET is then the output of certain values in the console via ``console.WriteLine()``.\n\nBut often these applications are supposed to run in the background or hidden, so that crashes or errors are not immediately noticeable if you don't have at least a rudimentary logging built in. Such logging is also useful for the later evaluation of program runs. For this reason pretty much all programs log in some way. Currently there an incredible number of logging frameworks available, that make it to the news every now and then, like [Log4Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) for Java.\n\nThe best known in the .NET area is Microsoft's own [ILogger (Microsoft.Extensions.Logging)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging), [log4net](https://logging.apache.org/log4net/), [NLog](https://nlog-project.org/) and [Serilog](https://serilog.net/). What they all have in common is, that they are highly flexible in terms of configuration, usage and storage of the logs. On the other hand, they are fat beasts, you have to learn to handle first and you have to deliver with the program always. The latter does not apply to the ILogger, but Microsoft has been known to complicate things so unnecessarily that it is almost no fun anymore.\n\nMany times this overload is simply not necessary, when you just need a log file for each run of your console application. Let me show you, how to achieve this with a dead simple ``StringBuilder``...\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nLets start in the ``Program.cs`` of a new .NET Core 6 console application. As you may know, in this version MS has changed the entry point ``static void Main(string[] args)``, which has existed for what feels like centuries, to the so-called **Top-Level Statements**, which means nothing else, that the entry point is now automatically generated ... and what most old-school developer think sucks, because you have little control over it anymore. But for this approach we need a global variable and therefore I've recreated ``Main`` like this:\n\n```C# Program.cs\n// TOP-LEVEL STATEMENTS\nMain.Start(args);\n\n// MAIN MODULE\nstatic public class Main {\n\n  static public void Start(string[] args) \n  {\n    //...\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Preparation of a small senseless console application\n\nLet's implement a little bit of the '*features*' first, like a new class called ``DoSomething`` that does the actual job:\n\n```C# DoSomething.cs\npublic class DoSomething\n{\n  public void Work(string param1)\n  {\n    //... doing heavy work with param1\n  }\n\n  public void MoreWork(string param2)\n  {\n    //... doing more work with param2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow let's process the command line arguments for running the app called **SimplestConsoleFileLogger** like this...\n\n``SimplestConsoleFileLogger.exe param1:this param2:that``\n\nFirst we create a new class for holding the parameters...\n\n```C# Parameters.cs\npublic class Parameter\n{\n    public string Param1 = \"\";\n    public string Param2 = \"\";\n}\n```\n\n... and then we populate a new instance of it with the values from the console arguments and run the worker class:\n\n```C# Program.cs\nstatic public class Main {\n\n  static Parameter PARAMETER = new Parameter();\n\n  static public void Start(string[] args) \n  {\n    //Process Arguments\n    foreach (string arg in args)\n    {\n      var a = arg.Split(':');\n      switch (a[0].ToUpper())\n      {\n        case \"PARAM1\": PARAMETER.Param1 = a[1]; break;\n        case \"PARAM2\": PARAMETER.Param1 = a[1]; break;\n        default: break;\n      }\n    }\n\n    DoSomething ds = new DoSomething();\n    ds.Work(PARAMETER.Param1);\n    ds.MoreWork(PARAMETER.Param2);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## The Logging\n\nNow we have our pretty senseless app and we want to log the jobs of the worker class. First, we have to implement a global variable for holding the log messages and secondly a small method to simplify the handling of the log:\n\n```C# Program.cs\nstatic public class Main {\n\n  ...\n\n  static StringBuilder LOGDATA = new StringBuilder();\n\n  public static void Log(params string[] args)\n  {\n    var msg = string.Join(\" \", args).TrimEnd();\n    LOGDATA.AppendLine(msg);\n  }  \n\n}\n```\n\nThe ``Log`` methods gets an infinite number of arguments (ParamArray) to assemble a message to log. This we can use now in our worker class:\n\n```C# DoSomething.cs\npublic class DoSomething\n{\n  public void Work(string param1)\n  {\n    //... doing heavy work with param1\n    Main.Log(\"Heavy work done with result\", \"SUCCESS\");\n  }\n\n  public void MoreWork(string param2)\n  {\n    //... doing more work with param2\n    Main.Log(\"More work done with result\", \"SUCCESS\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can use ``Main.Log(...)`` wherever you want, because its globally available.\n\n### Writing the log file\n\nLast, but not least, we have to persist the log messages into a file. This should done just before the application ends. For writing the log, we use a ``StreamWriter`` object, which accepts our ``StringBuilder``, where the messages are stored in seperate lines. By checking the length of the StringBuilder ``LOGDATA``, we ensure that the log file is only written, when there is something to write.\n\n```C# Program.cs\nstatic public class Main {\n\n  static public void Start(string[] args) \n  {\n    ...\n\n    HandleEnd();\n  }\n\n  static void HandleEnd()\n  {\n    if (LOGDATA.Length > 0)\n    {\n      string logFile = $\"{DateTime.Now.ToString(\"u\").Replace(\":\",\"-\")}.log\";\n      string logFilePath = Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, logFile);\n      StreamWriter logStream = new StreamWriter(logFilePath, true, Encoding.UTF8);\n      logStream.Write(LOGDATA);\n      logStream.Close();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat's it. As you see, the important parts are the globally available ``StringBuilder`` and the persistance of the messages in a file at the end. With this you can customize the messages as fancy as you want and you don't need one of the logging beasts.\n\n**Download the files via [Gist](https://gist.github.com/kristofzerbe/4f80cb67e5a3d65c0f7d528af493bf5c)**\n","tags":["Visual Studio","Logging","C#"],"categories":[".NET"]},{"title":"Thanks Dropbox, but I'm off","url":"/post/Thanks-Dropbox-but-I-m-off/","content":"\nI'm a customer of Dropbox many, many years, a paying customer, and was always happy about the service, as it is fast and easy to use. No problems ... until now! Be aware ... this will be a rant :/\n\nBut first a step back:\n\nNowadays it is normal to work with different classes of devices: stationary PCs, different types of laptops, tablets and also smartphones. You start writing a text on your laptop at home in the garden, have to interrupt it because of an appointment and continue writing on your tablet on your way, only to finish it at home on your PC, because it has started to rain. All of these used devices to write the text may have a different hard- and software configuration, but today we have synchronisation services like Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive and man others, which ensures that the same version of the text is available at all times at all devices.\n\nTo me it is obvious that software manufacturers cannot support every operating system, but I can expect that if they support a particular OS, they will do so on any hardware that the OS manufacturer also supports!\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## What has happened...\n\nI have similar hardware as described above, but with a gap: a Windows tablet. I have one with Android and manage my synchronization with a tool called [DropSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync&hl=de&gl=US), but due to limited disc space I can't sync bigger projects with thousands of files, like this blog. Whenever I want to continue writing an article on the road, I download the corresponding MD file and then upload it again afterwards. A bit cumbersome. Since the first appearance of Microsoft's Surface several years ago, I thought this type of hardware, which includes the same OS I'm using all the time - Windows - could be close my device gap and a couple of days ago, I put a bunch of Euros in the hand of a local dealer to finally close it with a Surface Pro X. 256GB SSD, 16GB RAM and the size of a sheet of paper should be good to work on stuff while on the road.\n\nAs with any new piece of hardware, I began to install my setup, [essential tools that I use very often](/about). This included Dropbox, of course ... with an unexpected result.\n\nWhile all the tools installed without a murmur, Dropbox bitched by saying that my device is not compatible with this version of the Dropbox client and that I should install the [Dropbox S Mode](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/dropbox-for-s-mode/9WZDNCRFJ0PK) app via the Windows Store instead. Yes sure, a Surface has an ARM processor instead of an x32/x64 from Intel or AMD, but what's the problem? Every single tool in my list works with Windows 10 under ARM64, at least in 32-bit emulation, but not Dropbox?\n\nTo say it loud and clear: the UWP app \"Dropbox S Mode\" is a disgrace! Not only does it use a technology that Microsoft is just saying goodbye to, no, it also offers less functionality than the actual Dropbox website. Folders cannot be downloaded as a whole, but only individual files, and a synchronization of some kind has been completely omitted. The thing is really just dirt. This kind of software is for grannies who already have a hard time holding a mouse, but not for power users, with several gigabytes of data!\n\nI don't let something like that sit on me so easily, but tried to find a trick via some research how to get the Dropbox client to work under ARM after all.  And on Dropbox's own forum alone, I found a bunch of posts on the topic:\n\n* [Is Windows 10 on ARM going to be compatible with the Dropbox desktop app?](https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-installs-integrations/Is-Windows-10-on-ARM-going-to-be-compatible-with-the-Dropbox/td-p/385120)\n* [Can I have the desktop app installed on my Surface Pro X?](https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-installs-integrations/Can-I-have-the-desktop-app-installed-on-my-Surface-Pro-X/td-p/370956/page/7)\n* [Dropbox client for Windows 11 ARM?](https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-installs-integrations/Dropbox-client-for-Windows-11-ARM/td-p/559111)\n* [Can't install the desktop app on a new PC](https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-installs-integrations/Can-t-install-the-desktop-app-on-a-new-PC/td-p/431247)\n\nThe oldest post I have found here was from 2019. Dropbox, you are not able to port your code to ARM within at least 3 years and the only answer you have for your paying users is *buy a regular computer*. Are you nuts? Are you begging to go under or be bought by one of the big fish due to management incompetence? New Dropbox features like Paper, Capture or Replay are nice ones, but whenever a company neglects its base, the reason why became big, it is close to the abyss. Best examples are [Lego](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/innovation-almost-bankrupted-lego-until-it-rebuilt-with-a-better-blueprint/) and Marvel.\n\n## A New Start\n\nI was aware of OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) since it was launched 2007, as Microsoft tried to counter the success of Dropbox, but it had its pitfalls and wasn't running so fluffy as the original. 15 years later, you can hardly resist the sync software from Redmont, because it is always included in everything that has Windows on it, but it has also become decisively better and more stable. The ARM disaster of Dropbox has now moved me to switch to OneDrive. I'm writing this article on my Surface tablet right now, and whenever I press CTRL-S, OneDrive syncs the MD file to my other machines.\n\nAt the end of the day, we're all about one thing: Convenience, and if you don't meet that standard (or abuse it), you die.

The US internet company makes it very easy for users to use its web-based services. The entry barriers are low and the interfaces are tidy and intuitive.\n\nIf you use the in-house Chrome browser, you can also be informed about incoming mails or upcoming appointments. One click and the browser opens with Gmail or Google Calendar ...\n\nBut it is not always necessary or desirable to load one of the Google tools completely in a new browser window, when you may already have two or three dozen tabs open in several windows and are in danger of losing track of them.\n\nThat's what Montreal-based software developer **[Jason Savard](https://jasonsavard.com/)** seems to have thought ten years ago. At that time, he began writing a Chrome extension that would report a newly received Gmail by means of a small icon in the extension bar of the browser and display it directly in a separate pop-up window by clicking on it. The result was **[Checker Plus for Gmail](https://jasonsavard.com/Checker-Plus-for-Gmail)**.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nIn addition to the extension for Gmail, Savard offers others for Calendar and Drive and all of them have one thing in common: You can do the most important functions of the services directly in the popup that opens: Reply to mail, write new mail, create appointment with reminder, upload file, get file link to share - Everything works without having to load the services' interfaces in a browser window.\n\nFor the author and probably some of the almost 2 million users, the Checker Plus extensions are the kind of tools you can't imagine working without them - that's how quickly you get used to the functionality and adapt your own workflow to it.\n\n---\n\n## Checker Plus for Gmail: Impressive range of functions\n\nThe Checker Plus tool for the web mailer Gmail places an icon in the extension bar that displays the number of unread mails by means of an indicator. Since it is possible to configure several Gmail accounts in the extension, all unread mails are summarised in the number.\n\nIf you click on the icon, a pop-up opens with a clear list of all accounts and the unread mails. The mails are displayed in compact mode, i.e. in addition to the sender and the subject, you also see an excerpt from the mail text.\n\nIf you now click on a mail, it is displayed in full in the popout and also takes any mail thread into account. The icon buttons *Archive*, *Mark Spam*, *Delete*, *Mark Read* and *Mark*, which are displayed when hovering over a mail, represent the most frequently used actions and usually make it unnecessary to use the *Open in Gmail* button.\n\n![Checker Plus for Gmail Chrome Extension Popup](checker-plus-for-gmail-1.png)\n\n![Checker Plus for Gmail Chrome Extension Popup - Display Mail Thread](checker-plus-for-gmail-2.png)\n\n### Massive Setting Options\n\nOver the years and with each new version (currently v22.9), countless options have been added, so that Savard had to divide them into nine groups, including the start page:\n\n1. Start Page with Quick Access\n2. General\n3. Notifications\n4. Do not disturb\n5. Button\n6. Accounts/Labels\n7. Skins and Themes\n8. Keys\n9. Voice Input\n\nIt would be foolish, to go into all the settings in this article, but a few deserve an extra portion of attention, such as those under *Accounts/Labels*. Here, users can decide whether the extension should determine the available Gmail accounts itself based on the login to Gmail saved in the browser or whether they should specify them manually. In both cases, it is then possible to select only certain labels for the notifications or to leave it at the standard inbox. This is very usefull if you have set up a system of automatic distribution to subfolders (labels).\n\nSince the extensions also control the interactive desktop notifications, it is useful to be able to define periods of time under *Do Not Disturb*, when this is not to happen. In addition to the option of using dates from the Google Calendar, you can also define weekly schedules for this purpose.\n\n---\n\n## Checker Plus for Google Calendar: Better than the original\n\nThe icon of the Chrome extension for Google Calendar visually warns of upcoming appointments and displays those for the next two days in the tooltip. If you sit at your computer all day and work in the Chrome browser, you can hardly talk your way out of missing an appointment, especially since the extension also takes over warnings via the Windows notification system.\n\nThe pop-up's interface is similar to the original at [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com/), merely placing the sidebar under a hamburger menu to save space. It replicates the basic functionality of the original and there is little reason to visit the original Google website when using it.\n\nBut it also does a few things better than Google. For example, the pop-up offers the same view options as *day*, *month*, *week*, *year* and *appointment overview*, but calls the latter a list and adds an overview as known from the Calendar Android app. In addition, you can define your own view in the settings, for example, if you want to keep an eye on the next three days or six weeks.\n\n![Pop-up of the Chrome extension Checker Plus for Google Calendar](checker-plus-for-calendar.png)\n\nThe current version v26.1.1 of Checker Plus for Google Calendar also has a lot of setting options, such as displaying the week numbers or marking the weekends. Particularly noteworthy here are the settings for notifications, which can be fine-tuned very well across multiple accounts and calendars.\n\n---\n\n## Checker Plus for Google Drive: Fewer functions\n\nThe pop-up of the Drive extension is basically a copy of the Google interface at [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com). It is limited to the list form and does without previews of the files, but also without advertisements, such as \"Buy storage space\". It also has nowhere near as many options in the context menu of a folder or file as the original, but this can generally be gotten over because the most important options such as *download*, *copy link*, *rename* and *remove* are available.\n\n![Pop-up of the Chrome extension Checker Plus for Google Drive](checker-plus-for-drive.png)\n\n---\n\n## Additional functions against donation\n\nFew Chrome extensions are as close to the needs of users as the **[Checker Plus extensions](https://jasonsavard.com/)**. The functional scope of the Gmail extension in particular is simply impressive and leaves hardly anything to be desired.\n\nOnly when it comes to localising the source code in currently more than 30 languages, Savard could take a little more care. Sometimes a little English gets mixed into otherwise German interfaces, especially in the settings. But any developer who has ever tried to offer his tool in so many languages will forgive him, because he knows the amount of work involved.\n\nUnfortunately, the settings area *Skins and Themes* is everything but generally understandable and no comparison to the otherwise good UX of the extensions. If you want to make the pop-up pretty with background images and other colours, you have to read up and understand Jason's concept of individualising separate elements.\n\nSince Jason Savard now works full time on his extensions, he is dependent on income to be generated from them. He has declared some settings, which he says he worked on for a long time, as \"additional functions\" that you get if you donate an amount of money to him once or monthly. A fair concept, especially since he guarantees daily updates and even a response time of five minutes in case of problems. Well ;) But it's nice to see a developer who puts so much heart and soul into his work.\n","tags":["Browser","Plugin","Mail"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Discoveries #16 - JavaScript","url":"/post/Discoveries-16-JavaScript/","content":"\nIn the first discoveries of 2022 I would like to offer you some interesting links to JavaScript articles that have general language features as their topic or extend them in a clever way.

True in the meaning, that the reading direction should be from left to right and not in the form of columns from top to bottom. For the latter, also called *Fake Masonry*, there are even two implementation options in CSS: Columns or Flex, whereas the [Columns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/columns) variant is the much simpler one.\n\nLets say you have a list of boxes you want to show in a grid-like list, but the height of every box is defined by its content, which results in different heights. Here is an example with a base64 encoded 1px image with an individually defined height:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n  <div class=\"item\">\n    Box 1\n    <img style=\"height:53px\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" />\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"item\">\n    Box 2\n    <img style=\"height:50px\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" />\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"item\">\n    Box 3\n    <img style=\"height:33px\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" />\n  </div>\n  <!-- ... 6 more items with different heights -->\n</div>\n```\n\nBy applying ``column-count`` and ``column-gap`` to the wrapper and a ``margin-bottom`` with the same value as the gap to each item, you will achieve this:\n\n![Simple Columns Layout](CSS-Columns-and-Drop-Shadow/sample-columns.png)\n\nThe order of the boxes is from top to bottom and then from left to right ... Fake Masonry, but is works as expected. Here is the most important CSS:\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n```CSS\n:root {\n  --gap: 20px;\n  --gap-half: calc(var(--gap) / 2);\n}\n.wrapper {\n  /* LAYOUT STYLES */\n  width: max-content;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: var(--gap-half);\n\n  /* COLUMN STYLES */\n  column-count: 3;\n  column-gap: var(--gap);\n}\n.item {\n  /* BASIC STYLES */\n  background-color: #fffaf5;\n\n  /* LAYOUT STYLES */\n  width: 200px;\n  margin-bottom: var(--gap);\n  padding: 15px;\n  overflow: auto;\n\n  /* COLUMN STYLES */\n  break-inside: avoid-column;\n}\n```\n\nSee the pen for the complete HTML and CSS:\n\n{% indiepen \"sample-columns\" 410 result %}\n\n---\n\n## Drop Shadow and the Chromium Bug\n\nTo make the list visually a little bit more interesting, we now add a shadow, which is half as thick as the gap, to the boxes:\n\n```CSS\n:root {\n  --gap: 20px;\n  --gap-half: calc(var(--gap) / 2);\n  --color-border: hsl(0 0% 90%);\n}\n.item {\n  /* ... more styles */\n  border: 1px var(--color-border) solid;\n  box-shadow: 1px 2px var(--gap-half) 5px var(--color-border);\n}\n```\n\nIn case you work with a Chromium based browser (Version 97.x as of today), you will be confronted with a bug. The \"break\" from one column to the next doesn't respect the full 10px high shadow of the next item. **It breaks too late**. You will get something like this:\n\n![Column layout with DropShadow in Chromium](CSS-Columns-and-Drop-Shadow/sample-columns-shadows.png)\n\n{% alertbox info %}\nI added a red shadow on hover, to make the bug more obvious. See following pen to inspect the CSS. In case you use Firefox (Version 96.x as of today), you won't see the bug, because Mozilla did it right.\n{% endalertbox %}\n\n{% indiepen \"sample-columns-shadows\" 410 result %}\n\n---\n\n## Workaround\n\n### Step 1\n\nIn order to achieve a proper result, we have to hack the HTML and the CSS a bit. First of all we have to wrap the content of an item with a new element called ``ìtem-inner``:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"item\">\n  <div class=\"item-inner\">\n    Box 1\n    <img style=\"height:53px\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" />\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Step 2\n\nNext, we move the ``width``, the ``border`` and the ``box-shadow`` from the item itself to the new inner element. Important here is, to set the background of the ``item`` element to ``transparent`` in order to prevent interfering with the shadow.\n\n```CSS\n:root {\n  --gap: 20px;\n  --gap-half: calc(var(--gap) / 2);\n  --color-border: hsl(0 0% 90%);\n}\n.item {\n  /* BASIC STYLES */\n  background-color: transparent;\n}\n.item-inner {\n  /* BASIC STYLES */\n  background-color: #fffaf5;\n  border: 1px var(--color-border) solid;\n  box-shadow: 1px 2px var(--gap-half) 5px var(--color-border);\n  transition: all ease-out 0.3s;\n\n  /* LAYOUT STYLES */\n  width: 200px;\n  padding: 15px;\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3\n\nNow we have to set the ``wrapper``'s gap to 0, because we will implement the spacing of the items by applying different paddings to the ``item`` element: **half of the gap** to be reached, to the ``left``, the ``right`` and the ``bottom`` padding and the **full gap** to the ``top``. The latter, to achieve pushing the previous element far enough away so as not to see anything of the shadow.\n\nBut because this would mean that the horizontal gap would be too large by half, we have to use a negative margin to pull the element up by that amount.  \n\n![Chromium Columns Shadows Fix Step 3.1](CSS-Columns-and-Drop-Shadow/sample-columns-shadows-fix-step1.png)\n\nThis in turn would mean, that the first ``item`` element in the list would be too high by the now defined negative top margin, which we correct again by using ``item:first-child``.\n\n![Chromium Columns Shadows Fix Step 3.2](CSS-Columns-and-Drop-Shadow/sample-columns-shadows-fix-step2.png)\n\n```CSS\n:root {\n  --gap: 20px;\n  --gap-half: calc(var(--gap) / 2);\n  /* ... more variables */\n}\n.wrapper {\n  /* ...more styles */\n  column-gap: 0;\n}\n.item {\n  /* ...

Roughly speaking, two known points in space can be used to calculate a third via the angles to it. In one or the other Hollywood flick of the genres war or spy movie you have surely come across this.\n\nHowever, triangulation also refers to the division of a surface into triangles or, more generally, the description of an object by means of polygons. It is used in topology and land surveying, but also in imaging methods of modeling.\n\nHow wonderfully this field of mathematics can be applied to photos is shown by the GitHub user [**RyanH**](https://github.com/RH12503) with his program [**Triangula**](https://github.com/RH12503/triangula) written in Go, which first roughly splits a given JPG or PNG image into triangles and then refines it further and further via mutations. Among other things, you can specify how many points you want to start with and how many mutations the program should perform. It is also possible to calculate the new image using hexagons instead of classic triangles.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n{% image_slide\n  \"triangula.png|UI of the tool Triangula written in Go\"\n  \"sample-40-generations.png|Sample 40 generations\"\n  \"sample-400-generations.png|Sample 400 generations\"\n  \"sample-4000-generations.png|Sample 4000 generations\"\n %}\n\nThe result is stylized images of the original, which can be used as a chic desktop background, for example. Due to the abstraction of the actual motif, such images are also very suitable as header images on websites, such as blogs, if the image should not distract from the actual content. Such an image has a great closeness to the original, but looks more like art.\n\nBesides PNG, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is also available as output format, which makes sense because SVG is an XML format and the polygons calculated by the program can also be written away directly as corresponding ``polygon`` entries as text. The generated SVG files are thereby smaller by a factor of 30, depending on the original, and thus fit in many places much better with tight bandwidths or used-up consumption limits on the Internet.\n\n---\n\n## Using Triangula on the command line\n\nRyan offers his program Triangula also as [CLI version](https://github.com/RH12503/Triangula-CLI/), which is called via the command line. The process of triangulating is separated into two parts: First you create the desired abstraction of an original image via the parameter ``run``, which is stored in a JSON file on the hard disk and in a second step you create either a PNG or an SVG as output file via ``render`` and the specification of the JSON file.\n\nSince the command line tool has the same options as the UI version, it is great for automating the processing of the images used when building a website, for example. It also makes it much easier to turn an entire folder of images into such artistic abstractions.\n\n---\n\n## Using triangulated images as placeholders on websites\n\nDepending on how good the Internet connection is and how well the developers brain of a website has worked, it can take a while until the browser of the smartphone has loaded the x-megabyte header or illustration image to finally be able to display it. It gets really annoying when no space has been reserved on the website for the image beforehand and the text that you have started to read suddenly jumps away.\n\nIn any case, the solution is to always use images that are as small as possible and adapted to the device, but they still have a certain file size if they are to look good. To prevent text jumping, nowadays one usually uses gray placeholders with or without loading bars to signal to the user that something will be displayed at this point shortly.\n\nRyan has found an amazingly effective solution for this as well: [tip - Triagulated Placeholders](https://github.com/RH12503/tip) - creating the smallest possible triangulated images and blending them using JavaScript.\n\nThe basis is a frontend, also written in Go, which uses the same algorithms as Triangula and with which the user can process several original images or an entire folder of photos at once via the interface.\n\n![Very simple but functional interface of the tool tip, also written in Go, for generating binary placeholders for web pages](Tringula-And-The-Beauty-Of-Mathematics/tip.png)\n\nThe output format from **tip** is not PNG or SVG, but a binary file, which consumes the least amount of memory of all technical possibilities.\n\nFor comparison the generated file sizes of the example image with resolution 1024 x 660:\n\n|Image|Size|\n|---|---|\n|Original|386 KB|\n|Triangula PNG|223 KB|\n|Triangula SVG|40,3 KB|\n|tip TRI|3,03 KB|\n\nThese files, with the extension TRI, are referenced by the web developer in the IMG tag of an image on a page in the ``data-src`` attribute, and a **JavaScript**, only 200 lines long, which is also included and delivered with the web page, takes care of immediately displaying this TRI file when the page is loaded and smoothly fading to the original image once it has been loaded. You can hardly make it more beautiful.","tags":["Imaging","SVG"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Discoveries #14","url":"/post/Discoveries-14/","content":"\nIn this month discoveries you will find some posts and pens regarding CSS and its possibilities.

Fat in terms of features, for sure, but also in size and load times. It made no sense to use an other IDE, while developing software with VB.NET/C#. But with the advent of Node.JS JavaScript, so far only known as a scripting language for web pages, outgrew itself and became a serious competitor to established languages.\n\nIn 2012 Adobe came out with [Brackets](https://brackets.io/), a lightweight IDE for developing web applications, written with the very same tech stack: HTML, CSS and JavaScript! Based on the [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework), it felt like a normal application! Mind blowing...\n\nIn 2015 there was a new kid in town: **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VS Code)**, of all things from ... Microsoft. During this time, the Redmond-based company had finally jumped on the open source bandwagon and perhaps they saw that Adobe was doing some things right on the IDE market with Brackets (but also some things wrong) and you didn't want to miss the chance to engage the open source community.\n\nThe speed with which VS Code passed other IDE's in the developer favor was quite amazing, due to the fact that the source code was openly available on GitHub and the developers in Switzerland released a new version every damn month.\n\nWhat was exciting for me was the question of how long it would take for someone to make this IDE based on web technology available online, i.e. in a browser. It took until 2021...\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n---\n\n### github.dev and Github Codespaces\n\nIn Juli 2021 GitHub announced the availability of **[github.dev]()** and **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)**. The main difference between these two solutions is that Codespaces runs the IDE within a container (VM) in the background, which enables you to run your project and ... it is only available for paid plans.\n\nThe main purpose of github.dev is to serve as a call target of the so-called **Magic Dot**, an easy way to open any repository in an editor. I blogged about this capabilty a while ago, see {% post_link 2021/GitHubs-Magic-Dot %}. Really amazing! Just press the ``dot`` key on every repository and you can browse the code files.\n\n![github.dev](github-dev.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## vscode.dev\n\nRecently, in October 2021, Microsoft (who owns GitHub) announced another online VS Code called **[vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev)**. It is practically the same IDE as github.dev, with one main difference: It is not bound to a GitHub repository, but is able to open any local project or even remote repositories from GitHub.\n\nHowever, it also has the same limitation that you cannot run a project, because there is no VM running in the background. But it is a really neat online editor, which runs on mobile devices too and feels absolutely like a local installed VS Code.\n\n![vscode.dev](vscode-dev.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## Gitpod\n\nBack in 2017 some developers from Kiel, Germany started a web-based platform called **[Gitpod](gitpod.io)** for providing fully functional orchestrated developer environments in the web. Since at that time VS Code was not yet running in the browser, they started the project [Eclipse Theia](https://theia-ide.org), which powers several online IDE's until today, but  switched to VS Code as the team around Erich Gamma [announced remote development capabilities](code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) in late 2020.\n\nWhats special about Gitpod is, that users are able to start a browser-based instance of the IDE just by adding the address of an GitHub repository as a parameter to the URL, like ``https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/kristofzerbe/kiko.io``. Gitpot then starts a container with the source code and shows up the IDE at a random URL like ``https://coffee-squirrel-htamfigy.ws-eu18.gitpod.io``.\n\nThis so called *Workspaces* can be stopped, resumed, shared and downloaded, because it is a container with everything in it you need to run. Really amazing!\n\n![Gitpod](gitpod-io.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## Other Monaco-driven IDE's\n\nVS Code actually consists of two parts: the platform itself, called [Code-OSS](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode), and the code editor **[Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)** included in it, which is also available as a separate project and used by other web-based IDE's, like the following...\n\n### Stackblitz\n\nThe IDE on **[stackblitz.com](https://stackblitz.com)** is mainly useful for web frontend developers. You can easily create Angular, React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt or even plain JavaScript or static HTML projects and connect them to an new repository on GitHub. But ... you can't load existing projects from GitHub into Stackblitz on the fly, you have to import them.\n\nWhat makes Stackblitz very comfortable is that it runs your frontend directly on their servers and gives it to you in a browser-like preview window via a random Url like ``https://web-platform-ywqj4s.stackblitz.io``, you can open up in a separate browser also.\n\n![Stackblitz](stackblitz-com.jpg)\n\n---\n\n### CodeSandbox\n\n**[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io)** works similar to Stackblitz, but offers some more features, like deployment to Vercel, Netlify or GitHub Pages and a test runner. \n\nAlso, you have full control over the sandbox that runs the preview of your project and the ability to invite other developers or visitors to the project, which makes it perfect for online coding seminars e.g. classrooms.\n\n![CodeSandbox](codesandbox-io.jpg)","tags":["VS Code"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Croatian Presets for Lightroom","url":"/post/Croatian-Presets-for-Lightroom/","content":"\nStaying in Croatia is always a joy, in summer but also in winter.

Depending on your needs, you can choose out of trillions of solutions, for every JS framework or vanilla JS, in every flavour, size and color. With many of them, however, you reach the limits quite quickly. Be it in terms of visual adaptability, extensibility or implementation. Customization cost time and nerves, especially if the respective library has structural weaknesses.\n\nHowever, from today on, I don't need to look for a suitable solution for my next project, because I found one that leaves absolutely none of my wishes unfulfillede: [**Spotlight**](https://nextapps-de.github.io/spotlight/) by Nextapps from Berlin, Germany.\n\n![Spotlight](spotlight.jpg)\n\nTo make it clear: this is not a paid advertising text or something like that. That wouldn't make sense either, because Spotlight is Open Source ([Apache 2.0 License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License)) and its code is availabel at GitHub. I'm just thrilled with the work of the developers.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n---\n\nThe first step on implementing every image gallery solution is the installation. Spotlight has different options, but the easiest one is to download the **bundled version**, which includes both the JS files and the image (icon) and CSS files. For the non-bundles files, you can choose the minified versions or even the original ES6 and LESS files. There is a NPM package also.\n\nFor the implementation you can either choose a declarative way using the ``spotlight`` class, where the shown thumb images to click on needs to have a wrapper...\n\n```html\n<a class=\"spotlight\" href=\"img1.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"thumb1.jpg\">\n</a>\n<a class=\"spotlight\" href=\"img2.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"thumb2.jpg\">\n</a>\n```\n\n... or programmatically via JavaScript:\n\n```js\nvar gallery = [\n    { src: \"img1.jpg\" },\n    { src: \"img2.jpg\" }\n];\nSpotlight.show(gallery /*, options */);\n```\n\nNext to the image, at the bottom left corner, a title, a description and/or a button can be displayed on a gallery slide, which is completely compatible with all types of devices.\n\nIt is possible to define image groups to show separately in the declaration mode by having an extra wrapper around a bunch of image wrappers. All options how the gallery has to be shown are also declarative:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"spotlight-group\" \n     data-title=\"Group title\">\n    <a class=\"spotlight\" href=\"img1.jpg\" \n       data-title=\"This is a title\">\n        <img src=\"thumb1.jpg\">\n    </a>\n    <a class=\"spotlight\" href=\"img2.jpg\" \n       data-title=\"This is another title\"\n       data-description=\"This is a description\">\n        <img src=\"thumb2.jpg\">\n    </a>\n</div>\n```\n\nSpotlight has 9 built-in controls to show in the bar at the top left:\n\n* Fullscreen\n* Zoom in\n* Zoom out\n* Autofit\n* Close\n* Theme\n* Play (Slideshow)\n* Download\n\n... and there is a possibility to insert custom controls during initialization.\n\nIf you provide several image sizes, Spotlight picks the optimal version regarding the current devices resolution, pixel ratio and bandwidth. But Spotlight is not limited to images. It can also display videos and even custom HTML fragments (DOM nodes) as slides.\n\nThrough its JavaScript API you can fully remote control the gallery and it has several options to customize the appearance of the slides to every need you can imagine.\n\n---\n\nThe implementation is a breeze. It took me less than 10 minutes to get Spotlight working here on this blog at the [photo page](/photos)!\n\nI can't think of any use case right now, that you couldn't implement easily and quickly with this amazing library.

Wrong ... after commiting my changes to Github, where my blog is living, and checking my RSS feed a while after, I saw this:\n\n![Empty posts in feedly](Uups-empty-posts/feed-empty-posts.png)\n\nThree empty posts...!?\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n---\n\n**The indiepen files in the asset subfolder were treated like posts by Hexo by no obvious reason!** A short research on the web lead me to a Github issue called [asset files were rendered when post_asset_folder set to true](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues/1490) from 2015, with several requests to fix the bug.\n\nSince I'm little familiar with Hexo's processors, I saw two ways to fix the problem:\n\n1. Write a plugin like [Hexo Hide Posts](https://github.com/printempw/hexo-hide-posts) to filter out unwanted \"posts\" after processing\n2. Try to find the problem in Hexo's source code, to avoid these files to be treated as posts a priori\n\nAfter a little searching around in Hexo's source code, I was able to identify the location where the problem was. In the post processor:\n\n```js ./node_modules/hexo/lib/plugins/processor/post.js (shortened)\nmodule.exports = ctx => {\n  ...\n\n  return {\n    pattern: new Pattern(path => {\n      if (isTmpFile(path)) return;\n\n      let result;\n\n      if (path.startsWith(postDir)) {\n        result = {\n          published: true,\n          path: path.substring(postDir.length)\n        };\n      } else if (path.startsWith(draftDir)) {\n        result = {\n          published: false,\n          path: path.substring(draftDir.length)\n        };\n      }\n\n      if (!result || isHiddenFile(result.path)) return;\n\n      result.renderable = ctx.render.isRenderable(path) && !isMatch(path, ctx.config.skip_render);\n\n      return result;\n    }),\n    process: function postProcessor(file) {\n      if (file.params.renderable) {\n        return processPost(file);\n      } else if (ctx.config.post_asset_folder) {\n        return processAsset(file);\n      }\n    }\n\n  };\n};\n...\n```\n\nIn the very beginning of processing posts, the code iterates over all files and folders in the ``_posts`` folder and creates a ``param`` object for each by using the ``pattern``. This object has an attribute named ``renderable``, which is used by the ``process`` method later on, to decide if it has to be rendered or not.\n\nBut ... the determination of ``renderable`` is based solely on wether a file has a renderer (*isRenderable*) or if it is listed in the ``skip_render`` configuration. See line 24 in the sample code. As HTML, JS and CSS files naturally have a renderer in Hexo, they will treated as posts!\n\n---\n\n## Alleviation Of The Problem\n\nIn this early stage of code execution, only files and folders are listed. There is no reference to a post or something like that, in order to find out if a certain file belongs to a post as an asset. Examination of the path will fail, because it is possible in Hexo to have a folder hierarchy under ``_posts``.\n\nThe only way to approach the problem solution is by making assumptions:\n\n1. If the user has activated the configuration ``post_asset_folder``, he wants to have asset files in a folder named after the post\n2. If the user has configured a certain file name for new posts in ``new_post_name`` (for example *:title.md*), it is not to be assumed, that he will create asset files with the same file extension.\n\nImportant here is, that it is not an option to hide the files in some way, because then they won't appear in the website. They have to be marked as *process it, but don't render it*, by bending the ``renderable`` attribute.\n\nThese considerations led to a small extension of the above code below line 24:\n\n```js ./node_modules/hexo/lib/plugins/processor/post.js (shortened)\n  ...\n\n  result.renderable = ctx.render.isRenderable(path) && !isMatch(path, ctx.config.skip_render);\n  \n  //if post_asset_folder is set, restrict renderable files to default file extension \n  if (result.renderable && ctx.config.post_asset_folder) {\n    result.renderable = (extname(ctx.config.new_post_name) === extname(path));\n  }\n\n  ...\n```\n\nThis is what I pushed as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/pull/4781) to the Hexo team today.

Future me: Don't forget the following!\n\nI while ago I was on a trip, shooting a lot of photographs and on my way back home I had three 32GB SD cards full with great photos. I was working with my old Nikon D7000, which has 2 card slots and I just took them out, when one of the cards was full. Worked fine for several years ... but after this trip, one of the cards, full with RAW files and wonderful photos, **w-a-s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N-O-T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r-e-a-d-a-b-l-e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a-n-y-m-o-r-e** ... f***!

In the end, always 2 different backups will exist on different media.\n\nWhen traveling, it is important to always have the tablet and the card reader with you, in addition to the camera and some spare SD cards.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1\n\nWhenever it is necessary or advisable, take both cards out of the camera and put the **XQD card** into the card reader and connect the latter to the tablet. Just put the **SD card** away, as we will use a spare card afterwards.\n\nOpen up **Solid Explorer** on the tablet...\n\n![Step 1 - Connected card Solid Explorer](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/1-connect-card-solid-explorer.png)\n\nCopy the complete folder ``DCIM/101ND500`` (where the photos are stored) to a separate folder called ``RAW`` on the ``disk`` (SD card extension) of the tablet.\n\n![Step 1 - Copy card to disk](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/2-copy-card--to-disc.png)\n\n---\n\n## Step 2\n\nRename the new folder on the ``disk`` to something appropriate:  \n(Screenshot says *Rename a file*, but that's a bug in the app)\n\n![Step 2 - Rename disk folder](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/3-rename-disk-folder.png)\n\n---\n\n## Step 3\n\nInsert the **XQD card** and a **spare SD card** back into the camera and wipe them both via the built-in menu.\n\n**Your backup is now on the orginal SD cards and your tablet.**\n\n---\n\n## Step 4 (optional)\n\nIf you have time and leisure, you can use **Photo Mate R3** to review and rate your images.\n\n![Step 4 - Open folder in Photo Mate](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/4-open-folder-in-photomate.png)\n\n{% alertbox warning %}\n**Don't delete any photos in this step!**  \nJust mark photos with RED, which can be removed afterwards, because the app is sometimes not fast enough to delete the right photo, when you has opened the next one!\n{% endalertbox %}\n\n![Step 4 - Rate photos](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/5-rate-photos.png)\n\n---\n\n## Step 5\n\nOpen up **Dropsync** on the tablet and set up a new sync profile, if you haven't done so already:\n\n![Step 5 - Setup sync](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/6-setup-sync.png)\n\nThe *``remote folder``* is a folder called ``RAW`` in your **Dropbox** and the *``local folder``* is the ``RAW`` folder on your disk. *``Sync method``* should be ``Upload then delete``, because you don't need the second backup on your tablet, after the photos are transfered to Dropbox.\n\nRun the synchronization:\n\n![Step 5 - Run sync](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/7-run-sync.png)\n\n![Step 5 - Running sync](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/8-running-sync.png)\n\n**Your backup is now on the original SD cards and Dropbox.**\n\n---\n\n## Step 6\n\nAfter you have enjoyed your trip and be back home, move the photo folder from your **Dropbox** to your **local storage**, which of course should also have a backup of some kind:\n\n![Step 6 - Move folder in Windows](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/9-move-folder-in-windows.png)\n\n**Your backup is now on the original SD cards and your local storage.**\n\n---\n\n## Step 7\n\nIf you've already rated your images along the way, **Photo Mate R3** has already stored that metadata in an XMP sidecar file, that is compatible with Lightroom:\n\n![Step 7 - Files in Windows](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/10-files-in-windows.png)\n\nOpen up **Lightroom** and import the folder from your **local storage**:\n\n![Step 7 - Import Lightroom](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/11-import-lightroom.png)\n\n---\n\n## Step 8\n\nIn the **Lightroom** library, filter all photos with the RED flag and set them as REJECTED:\n\n![Step 8 - Set red as rejected](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/12-set-red-as-rejected.png)\n\n---\n\n## Step 9\n\nDelete all photos marked as REJECTED:\n\n![Step 9 - Delete rejected](Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/13-delete-rejected.png)\n\n---\n\n## Step 10\n\nIf you are sure that your local backup was done once, you can safely wipe the original SD cards, in order to use them for the next time.\n","tags":["Lightroom","Imaging","Workflow"],"categories":["Photo-Editing"]},{"title":"Application-Specific Links on Windows 10","url":"/post/Application-Specific-Links-on-Windows-10/","content":"While reading the Chris Coyier's post [Application-Specific Links](https://css-tricks.com/application-specific-links/) the other day, I realized what has been bugging me for a long time now: a proper solution for openening a certain URL in a modern Web App.\n\nSince the beginning of the digital age (feels like that), we have files associated to a certain application, installed on our machine, regardless if its running Windows, iOS, OS/2 or whatever. We have learned that well and no one questions it ... but ... the IT world keeps on turning and today we are not only talking about files, but about links.\n\nMany modern applications are written with Web technologies, thanks to cross platform frameworks like [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). Some of them are real apps for working on things, like the famous editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and some are mirroring their online services in a desktop app only, like [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/downloads/windows) or [Notion](https://www.notion.so/desktop). However, the latter have the problem how to deal with links to their online services. When a user is sent a link and has become accustomed to using the desktop app, it won't open in the app as he clicks on it, but in his default browser. The question is, how to associate not only files, but links with certain desktop apps?\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n---\n\n## Executables and URL Schemes\n\nTriggered by [Notions announcement](https://thomasjfrank.com/how-to-share-notion-links-that-open-directly-in-the-app/) of using a dedicated link protocol ``notion://`` to open up Notion links directly in the Notion App, Chris wrote about the possibilities an a Mac to associate certain URL schemes with a Web App in general. His choice fell on [Choosy](https://www.choosyosx.com/), an app which hooks into to the process on opening links by beeing the systems default browser and forwarding the URL to configured applications.\n\nFair enough, but it's a tool for Mac. However, it was not particularly difficult to find equivalent programs for Windows 10, my preferred OS:\n\n* [Browser Selector](https://github.com/DanTup/BrowserSelector)\n* [Browser Select](https://github.com/zumoshi/BrowserSelect)\n* [Browser Picker](https://github.com/mortenn/BrowserPicker)\n* [Browser Choose 2](https://browserchooser2.com/#about)\n* ... name yours\n\nInterestingly, Microsoft already has something similar built into Windows, but prevents users from messing with it:\n\n![Apps for Websites](Application-Specific-Links-on-Windows-10/apps-for-websites.png)\n\nThe feature is targeted from [UWP](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform) applications only, therefore the developer has to implement it by extending the app manifest: [Web-to-App Linking with AppUriHandlers](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/10/14/web-to-app-linking-with-appurihandlers/).\n\nWhat Chris' approach and all similar Windows programs have in common is, that they are based on executables, EXE files and yes, the cross-platform apps mentioned above are executables, but for me this is too short. What about Chromium based Progressive Web Apps (PWA)?\n\nSince the Chromium team has introduced the possibility to add a website as desktop shortcut and start it in a new window, without any browser specific toolbars and other stuff, it became very popular, especially if this website was implemented by the developer as a [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/).It does not matter whether all PWA features, such as offline mode or similar, are available. The mere fact of being able to use an online service in its own window is a gain.\n\nBut such an app has no specific executable! It will be executed by the browser with some parameters itself. The question is, how to associate a certain URL scheme or a custom protocol with these web apps?\n\n---\n\n## PWA's on Windows\n\nSome basics about how Chromium based browsers are dealing with this feature:\n\nAs you click on **Create Shortcut...** in the **More Tools** menu in Chrome or Edge and confirm the following dialog (or install the PWA), a new folder in ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Web Applications`` will be created. Its name starts with ``_crx_`` and is followed by a random string (so called **app-id**), f.e. **``ffokdlainpppngbbhdcobaocmbobgdii``**. In this folder the [Favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) of the website is stored.\n\nIf it is a real PWA and has a [Web App Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/Manifest), you will find all resources defined there in another subfolder named by the app-id below ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Web Applications\\Manifest Resources``.\n\n{% alertbox exclamation %}\nThe paths differ depending on which browser profile is active. In this case **'default'**.\n{% endalertbox %}\n\nThe desktop shortcut, which will be created, points to an executable named ``chrome_proxy.exe`` or ``msedge_proxy.exe``. These files are scaled-down versions of the browser executable itself. Its main purpose is to bypass a Windows error as described in its [source code](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/chrome/chrome_proxy/chrome_proxy_main_win.cc), in order to create a correct shortcut.\n\nThe important part of the shortcut are the calling parameters:\n\n* ``--app-id`` - the random ID generated by the browser\n* ``--profile-directory`` - the browser profile to use; mostly 'default'\n\nIf you are interested, Chromium has dozens of parameters, some to change the behaviour and others only for debugging purposes. Peter Beverloo provides an automatic generated [List of all Chromium Command Line Switches](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/).\n\n### ... a bit deeper, just for fun\n\nThe following has nothing to do with the actual problem and doesn't help in any way, but it was interesting to dig a bit deeper into the operating principles of Chromium.\n\nAs we saw that the browser creates a unique ID for the new shortcut, we find all needed data referenced in the file ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\preferences``. It has no extension, but it is a JSON file.\n\nTwo sections are relevant in this file:\n\n**browser.app_window_placement.\\_crx\\_&lt;app-id&gt;**\n\nHolds the information how the window is displayed on the desktop (metrics).\n\n```json preferences > browser.app_window_placement\n\"_crx_ffokdlainpppngbbhdcobaocmbobgdii\": {\n    \"bottom\": 889,\n    \"left\": 161,\n    \"maximized\": false,\n    \"right\": 1610,\n    \"top\": 56,\n    \"work_area_bottom\": 920,\n    \"work_area_left\": 0,\n    \"work_area_right\": 1707,\n    \"work_area_top\": 0\n}\n```\n\n**extensions.settings.&lt;app-id&gt;**\n\nHolds every other information about the app, including the complete manifest und the URL to show.\n\n```JSON preferences > extensions.settings (shortened)\n\"ffokdlainpppngbbhdcobaocmbobgdii\": {\n    \"active_bit\": false,\n    \"active_permissions\": {\n        \"api\": [],\n        \"manifest_permissions\": []\n    },\n    \"app_launcher_ordinal\": \"zzo\",\n    \"commands\": {},\n    \"content_settings\": [],\n    \"creation_flags\": 17,\n    \"events\": [],\n    \"from_bookmark\": true,\n    \"from_webstore\": false,\n    \"granted_permissions\": {\n        \"api\": [],\n        \"manifest_permissions\": []\n    },\n    \"incognito_content_settings\": [],\n    \"incognito_preferences\": {},\n    \"install_time\": \"13266055455495996\",\n    \"launchType\": 3,\n    \"locallyInstalled\": true,\n    \"location\": 1,\n    \"manifest\": {\n        \"app\": {\n            \"display_mode\": \"browser\",\n            \"icon_color\": \"#186AA5\",\n            \"launch\": {\n                \"web_url\": \"https://trello.com\"\n            },\n            \"linked_icons\": [ ... ]\n        },\n        \"description\": \"Organize anything, together.

The most famous is ``mailto:``. A click on such a link opens the default mail editor. Since 2006 the W3C discusses an extension called ``registerProtocolHandler``, every web app could implement to tell the OS, that it is responsible for a certain protocol.\n\n```js\nnavigator.registerProtocolHandler(\"web+myfancyapp\",\n  \"https://my-fancy-web-app.com/?url=%s\",\n  \"My Fancy App Handler\");\n```\n\nIf this registrations as the user enters the site for the first time, he will be asked by the browser for allowance, he has to confirm to make it work.\n\nAs the developer implements the links, he has to write it like that:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"web+myfancyapp:settings\">Go To Settings</a>\n```\n\nThe registration and a click on such a link causes the browser to request ``https://my-fancy-web-app.com/?url=settings``.\n\nFor understandable reasons some protocols are blacklisted, like *mailto*, *irc*, *tel* and others. Custom protocol schemes has to have the prefix ``web+``, in order to avoid interference with the standardized protocols. As of May 2021, it is part of the [capabilities project](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/capabilities) and is in development currently.\n\nNice ... but doesn't helps in solving our problem in the first place, because we can't yet break out of the browser with it. We need something to tell the browser that an installed PWA is responsible for this protocol...\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Protocol Handlers\n\nThere is no official W3C proposal, but experiments around the Chromium team to extend the **PWA's manifest file** like that:\n\n```json web.manifest\n\"protocol_handlers\": [\n  {\n    \"protocol\": \"web+myfancyapp\",\n    \"url\": \"/?url=%s\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis could be the bridge we need to bind a PWA to a certain protocol, in order to open up the registered browser app, instead of a new tab. But its is just an experiment.\n\n---\n\n## Manifest URL Handlers\n\nAnother approach on connecting certain links to a PWA is similar to the manifests ``protocol_handlers`` but for URL schemes. No need for registering a protocol ... browser just parse the URL and show up my app:\n\n```json web.manifest\n\"url_handlers\" : [\n  {\n    \"origin\": \"https://my-fancy-app.com\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"origin\": \"https://*.my-fancy-app.com\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nSimple and straightforward. There is a [Chrome Platform Page](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5739732661174272) for this feature and the current status is *Origin Trial* for version 93!\n\nTo try it out, you can enable ``#enable-desktop-pwas-url-handling`` in Edge and Chrome:\n\n![Chrome Flag: Desktop PWA URL handling](Application-Specific-Links-on-Windows-10/enable-desktop-pwas-url-handling.png)\n\nBut ... it is also not even on the way to an official proposal :|\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs of today there is no solution for Windows users to associate links with the bunch of different applicationson windows, as we are used to from the files. But there is a special technique regarding web apps at the horizon, zo ease this pain, even if it depends on the app developers. \n\nMaybe Microsoft should think about their approach of **Apps for Websites**, in order to make it possible for users to extend that. The cherry on top would be then, if they decide to integrate the upcoming Protocol and URL Handlers, defined by the developers, right into this tool.\n\n---\n\n## More Info\n\n{% moreinfo '{ \"list\": [\n  [ \"whatwg.org\", \"HTML - Living Standard\",\n  \"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/system-state.html#custom-handlers\" ],\n  [ \"MDB Web Docs\", \"Web-based protocol handlers\",\n  \"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerProtocolHandler/Web-based_protocol_handlers\" ],\n  [ \"Thomas Steiner (web.dev)\", \"URL protocol handler registration for PWAs\",\n  \"https://web.dev/url-protocol-handler/\" ],\n  [ \"Matt West\", \"Registering Protocol Handlers to Intercept Special Links\",\n  \"https://mattwest.design/registering-protocol-handlers-to-intercept-special-links\" ],\n  [ \"Gyuyoung\", \"What is navigator.registerProtocolHandler?\",\n  \"https://blogs.igalia.com/gyuyoung/2017/12/13/what-is-navigator-registerprotocolhandler/\" ],\n  [ \"GitHub Issue on W3C/Manifest\", \"Add manifest option for PWAs to be registered as scheme/protocol handlers\",\n  \"https://github.com/w3c/manifest/issues/846\" ],\n  [ \"MDN Web Docs\", \"protocol_handlers\",\n  \"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/protocol_handlers\" ],\n  [ \"Microsoft Docs\", \"Experimental features in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)\",\n  \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/experimental-features\" ],\n  [ \"GitHub MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers\", \"URL Protocol Handler Registration for PWAs\",\n  \"https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/URLProtocolHandler/explainer.md\" ]\n]}' %}\n","tags":["Browser","Windows","PWA"],"categories":["Misc"]},{"title":"Pattern for dynamic Hexo pages","url":"/post/Pattern-for-dynamic-Hexo-pages/","content":"\n[Hexo](https://hexo.io/) is a great SSG platform for blogging. Just write your Markdown beneath some Frontmatter meta data, run ``hexo generate`` and publish the results to a web server.\n\nBut at some point you may want to process different data from internal or external sources and integrate it into your blog. Hexo doesn't support this out of the box, but has a powerful feature called [Generator](https://hexo.io/api/generator.html), which helps you to achieve your goal. The following is a sample and pattern of how to implement this.\n\nThe starting point of my example is the requirement to display several elements of the same type on a dynamic page, but you can of course adapt the example according to your needs.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n---\n\n## The Page\n\nFirst of all we need a Hexo page for the meta data and for some text we want to show at the beginning of the page to describe what is shown below. In order not to interfer the classic post generation, we create a new folder in Hexo's ``source`` folder called **``_dynamic``**, where we place the MD file for the new dynamic page.\n\n{% alertbox exclamation %}\nThe underscore in the name of the folder ``_dynamic`` is important, because Hexo doesn't touch subfolders in ``source`` with this starting character while generating the site. Without, it would be treated as a normal page.\n{% endalertbox %}\n\n```md ./source/_dynamic/my-special-page.md\n---\ntitle: My Title\nsubtitle: My Subtitle\ndate: 2021-08-24 19:24:00\nmySpecialProperty: \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\"\n---\n\nSome text to show above the dynamic created content...\n\n```\n\nThe Frontmatter data has no limits. You can add as much properties as you like.\n\n---\n\n## The Layout Template\n\nHexo works with EJS layout files. Whenever a page should be created, the calling method has to define which layout file should be used. Therefor we create a special EJS file for our dynamic page and place it in the ``layout`` folder.\n\n```js ./themes/&lt;your-theme&gt;/layout/my-special-layout.ejs\n<h1 class=\"page-title\"><%= page.title %></h1>\n<h2 class=\"page-subtitle\"><%= page.subtitle %></h2>\n\n<div class=\"page-content\">\n  <%- page.content %>\n\n  <div class=\"view grid\">\n    <% for(var i=0; i < page.items.length; i++) { %>\n      <%- partial('_partial/my-special-item', { item: page.items[i] }) %>\n    <% } %>\n  </div>  \n\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  // Extend the page with JavaScript ...\n</script>\n```\n\nOn generating the page later on, an object called ``page`` will be used to process the EJS, with all information we want to show on the page, like ``content`` (text of the Markdown file) and all meta data from the Frontmatter (title, subtitle and so on).\n\nSpecial attention is paid to **``items``**, because this property holds the list of all items we want to show on the page. Each object in this list have multiple custom properties you define, when you are assemble the data to show in the generator, but more about that later.\n\nIn the ``script`` tag you can write JavaScript to interact with your data on the page, like filtering stuff or other things the user should can do with your data.\n\n---\n\n## The Partial Template For Items\n\nIn order not to blow up the layout EJS, it is advisable to separate the template for the item itself to an extra file, referenced in the layout file (``_partial/my-special-item``) as a Partial.\n\n```js ./themes/&lt;your-theme&gt;/layout/_partial/my-special-item.ejs\n<div class=\"my-item\">\n    <!-- Definition of an item -->\n</div>\n```\n\nThe layout EJS will iterate over the list of items in the FOR loop and handover one of these object to the Partial to render.\n\n---\n\n## The Generator\n\nAs we have made our preparations, we are now able to implement our special generator itself.\n\nHexo uses so called Generators to \"produce\" the HTML for your site and you can add your own by using the ``register`` method. The result of a generator has to be an object with at least three properties:\n\n* ``data`` - Data object with all necessary information to process the given layout EJS\n* ``path`` - The path where the HTML file should be created\n* ``layout`` - The layout EJS file, which should be processed\n\n```js ./themes/&lt;your-theme&gt;/scripts/my-special-generator.js\nhexo.extend.generator.register(\"my-special-generator\", async function(locals) {\n  \n  // INSTANTIATE A NEW DATA OBJECT\n  let page = {};\n  page.name = \"my-special-page\";\n\n  // Do something to get content and data for the page\n\n  // INSTANTIATE THE RESULT OBJECT\n  let result = {\n    data: page,\n    path: path.join(page.name, \"index.html\"),\n    layout: \"my-special-layout\"\n  }\n\n  // RETURN THE RESULT\n  return result;  \n});\n```\n\nIn this basic structure, you will find again the layout file, we created earlier. The output will be rendered in an HTML file called ``index.html`` at the subfolder ``my-special-page``, as we take the name of the page for it, as we did it for the name of the source MD file.\n\nThe next thing we have to implement here, is the content of the source MD file.\n\n{% alertbox info %}\nThe parameter ``locals`` gives you access to the site variables, with all information about the site and its pages, posts, categories and tags!\n{% endalertbox %}\n\nThe first 4 lines in the following script are the references to some helpers we need. Please be sure, that you install them first via ``npm install``.\n\n```js ./themes/&lt;your-theme&gt;/scripts/my-special-generator.js\nconst log = require('hexo-log')({ debug: false, silent: false });\nconst path = require('path');\nconst fs = require('hexo-fs');\nconst front = require('hexo-front-matter');\n\nhexo.extend.generator.register(\"my-special-generator\", async function(locals) {\n  \n  // GET REFERENCE TO HEXO'S CONFIGURATION\n  let config = this.config;\n\n  // SHOW MESSAGE ON GENERATING\n  log.info(\"Processing items for dynamic page\");\n\n  let page = {};\n  page.name = \"my-special-page\";\n\n  // GET THE PATH TO THE SOURCE FILE\n  const mdSource = path.join(config.source_dir, \"_dynamic\", page.name + \".md\");\n\n  // GET THE CONTENT OF THE SOURCE FILE\n  const md = fs.readFileSync(mdSource);\n\n  // PARSE THE FRONTMATTER OF THE SOURCE FILE\n  let fm = front.parse(md);\n\n  // ADD THE FRONTMATTER TO THE DATA OBJECT\n  page = {...page, ...fm};\n\n  // CONVERT MARKDOWN CONTENT OF THE SOURCE FILE INTO HTML\n  page.content = hexo.render.renderSync({ text: page._content, engine: 'markdown' });\n\n  // Do something to get items data for the page\n  //page.items = [];\n  //...\n\n  let result = {\n    data: page,\n    path: path.join(page.name, \"index.html\"),\n    layout: \"my-special-layout\"\n  }\n\n  return result;  \n});\n```\n\nThe only thing missing now, is your implemention of filling ``page.items`` with a list of objects you want to show on the page. There are no limits to your imagination. Get data from external API's or process JSON data, stored in the ``data`` folder ... or whatever you prefer.\n\nA live example of this approach are the pages [TINY TOOLS](/collections/tiny-tools/) (processing data from the Trello API) and [PHOTOS](/photos) here on this blog.\n","tags":["Hexo","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Visualize the codebase of your GitHub repo","url":"/post/Visualize-the-codebase-of-your-GitHub-repo/","content":"\nBeginning of the month, [Amelia Wattenberger](https://twitter.com/Wattenberger) of [GitHub Next](https://next.github.com/) has published a project to create a SVG visualization of a GitHub repository's codebase.\n\nOn the project page **[Visualizing a codebase](https://next.github.com/projects/repo-visualization)**, she talks about the advantages of code vizualization in terms of a better overview and comparability of code ...  and I loved it at first sight, because I'm an absolute visual person.\n\n![Screenshot from the project page](screenshot-repo-visualization.png)\n\nBut her attempt was not only to show us what's possible (static SVG files and even interactive apps for code browsing, filtering and comparing), but give us the possibility to create our own codebase diagrams as SVG automatically, whenever we commit our code, by running a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), she and her team has developed ... the [**Repo Vizualizer**](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer)\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nActually, her instructions are quite simple to implement, but the devil is in the details and I would like to show you what you may need for this.

Especially when utilizing a bunch of libraries and frameworks, bundling is some sort of a must. The offer on bundlers and task runners is large on the web: [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/), [Browserify](https://browserify.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and \"DingDong\" (just replace with the hotest new shit available).\n\nBut, it is not always necessary to replace your complete building pipeline, when the new \"DingDong\" is hyped in the media. Brave old tools like [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) are doing their job pretty well ... and you are able to integrate some more modern approaches on bundling JS, for example.\n\nI couple of months ago, while working on a private project, I became attentive to [Rollup.js](https://www.rollupjs.org/), a next-generation JavaScript module bundler from Rich Harris, the author of Svelte. Rollup uses the new standardized format for code modules included in the ES6 revision of JavaScript and supports Tree-Shaking, which means that it analyzes all your ES6 ``imports`` statements and bundles only the code which is used. Pretty cool ... but ... it is a JavaScript bundler only and there are no plugins for Gulp, my favourite task runner.\n\nIn this article I will show you, how to integrate Rollup in your Gulp bundling pipeline.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n---\n\n## Install Rollup\n\nBest practice is to install Rollup globally:\n\n```js\nnpm install --global rollup\n```\n\n---\n\n## The Gulp File\n\nStarting point was my ``gulpfile.js`` as follows:\n\n```js gulpfile.js\nconst { src, dest, watch, series, parallel } = require('gulp');\nconst del = require('del');\nconst cssimport = require(\"gulp-cssimport\");\nconst cleancss = require('gulp-clean-css');\nconst sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');\n\n/* Clean distribution folder */\nfunction clean() {\n    return del('./dist/**', { force: true });\n}\n\n/* Bundle CSS with sourcemapping, imports and cleaning */\nfunction css() {\n  return src('./styles/app.css')\n    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())\n    .pipe(cssimport({}))\n    .pipe(cleancss({ debug: true }, (details) => {\n      console.log(`${details.name} BEFORE: ${details.stats.originalSize}`);\n      console.log(`${details.name} AFTER: ${details.stats.minifiedSize}`);\n    }))\n    .pipe(sourcemaps.write('.', { sourceRoot: '/styles' }))\n    .pipe(dest('./dist/'));\n}\n\nexports.default = series(clean, css);\n\n```\n\nThis pipeline only bundles CSS yet, when calling ``gulp`` in the command line.\n\n---\n\n## Calling Rollup for JS bundling\n\nRollup has [dozens of parameters](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#command-line-reference) to define everything you need, but it also supports a config file, which allows you to configure everything there and run ``rollup -c`` only. Very useful on this approach.\n\n```js rollup.config.js\nexport default {\n  input: './js/app.js',\n  output: {\n    file: './dist/app.js',\n    format: 'es',\n    sourcemap: true\n  }\n};\n```\n\nAs there is no Gulp plugin for Rollup, we need to execute Rollup in the Gulp pipeline by command. For this I've created a helper in my ``gulpfile.js``, to be able to execute whichever command:\n\n```js gulpfile.js\nlet HELPERS = {\n  execute: (command) => {\n    const process = exec(command);\n    process.stdout.on('data', (data) => { console.log(data.toString()); })\n    process.stderr.on('data', (data) => { console.log(data.toString()); })\n    process.on('exit', (code) => { \n      console.log('Process exited with code ' + code.toString()); \n    })\n    return process;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis helper is used in a Gulp command function to call Rollup:\n\n```js gulpfile.js\nfunction javascript() {\n    return HELPERS.execute('rollup -c');\n}\n```\n\nThe last thing I had to do, is to insert the command in the pipeline to run in parallel to the CSS bundling:\n\n```js gulpfile.js\nexports.default = series(clean, parallel(css, javascript));\n```\n\nPretty straightforward, isn't it?

In this post I will show you how to achieve this.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nThe script is not really rocket science: We just have to surround an image tag....\n\n```html\n<img src=\"my-image.jpg\" />\n```\n\n... with a wrapper, which holds the original image and a blurred duplicate of it:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"shadow-wrapper\">\n  <img class=\"drop-shadow\" src=\"my-image.jpg\" />\n  <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"my-image.jpg\" />\n</div>\n```\n\nThe rest will be done by CSS:\n\n```css\ndiv.shadow-wrapper { /* Wrapper */\n    position: relative;\n    margin-bottom: 30px;\n}\ndiv.shadow-wrapper img.drop-shadow { /* Original image */\n    position: absolute;\n    left: 0;\n    top: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    z-index: 1;\n    margin: 0;\n    float: none;\n}\ndiv.shadow-wrapper img.shadow { /* Shadow image */ \n    position: absolute;\n    width: 90%;\n    left: 5%;\n    top: 15%;\n    z-index: 0;\n    filter: blur(10px);\n    opacity: 0.8;\n    margin: 0;\n    float: none;\n}\n```\n\nTo make long story short: The wrapper is positioned ``relative`` and both images ``absolute``. The shadow image is 10% smaller than the original, blurred by 10 pixels and lies beneath the original one, slightly shifted down by 15%.\n\nVery important is to give the wrapper a bottom margin, otherwise the shadow will be rendered to tight to other elements, what looks not good.\n\n## The Script\n\nWhat the script should do:\n\n* Take any image tag with a particular class name (here ``drop-shadow``)\n* Create a new wrapper with all classes the image tag has\n* Size the wrapper as the image\n* Place the image tag inside the wrapper\n* Clone the image tag and append it to the wrapper also\n* Replace the image tag with the new wrapper HTML\n\n```js\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"img.drop-shadow\").forEach(function(item) {\n\n  let wrapper = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  wrapper.classList.add(\"shadow-wrapper\");\n\n  item.classList.forEach(function(c) {\n    if (c != \"drop-shadow\") wrapper.classList.add(c);\n  });\n  wrapper.style.width = item.clientWidth + \"px\";\n  wrapper.style.height = item.clientHeight + \"px\";\n\n  wrapper.insertAdjacentHTML(\"beforeend\", item.outerHTML);\n\n  let shadow = item.cloneNode();\n  shadow.classList.remove(\"drop-shadow\");\n  shadow.classList.add(\"shadow\");\n  wrapper.insertAdjacentHTML(\"beforeend\", shadow.outerHTML);\n\n  item.outerHTML = wrapper.outerHTML;\n}\n```\n\nThe result in comparison with no shadow and the default ``box-shadow``:\n\n{% indiepen \"sample\" 600 %}\n\nHappy shadowing...\n","tags":["CSS","Imaging","DOM"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Generate Social Media Images Automatically","url":"/post/Generate-Social-Media-Images-Automatically/","content":"\nFrom day one of this blog I wanted to combine two of my passions: tech stuff and photography. All these photos I have shot myself in recent years and now they are representing my thoughts & findings about digital technology. I wrote about my approach to provide these images in my post {% post_link 2020/Automatic-Header-Images-in-Hexo %}.\n\nWhen I share one of my posts on social media I provide the appropriate image as a visual anchor to my writing. The technique behind this are the ``meta`` tags in the HTML of my posts:\n\n```html\n<!-- Schema.org for Google -->\n<meta itemprop=\"image\" content=\"https://kiko.io/photos/normal/DSC_6776.jpg\">\n\n<!-- Open Graph -->\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://kiko.io/photos/normal/DSC_6776.jpg\">\n\n<!-- Twitter -->\n<meta property=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\">\n<meta property=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://kiko.io/photos/normal/DSC_6776.jpg\">\n```\n\nThere are several meta tags for different purposes regarding images. For more information see the links at the end of this post. To make a long story short: The sum of these approaches ensures that when an article is posted, the corresponding image is also displayed in the social media post.\n\nBut ... it's only the image, without a visual reference to the post itself. In this article I want to show you how to combine the photo with some meta information of the post automatically, to get a **Social Media Image**.\n\n![Generation Flow](Generate-Social-Media-Images-Automatically/generation-flow.png)\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n---\n\nStarting point of my thoughts were two posts from [**Drew McLellan** (Dynamic Social Sharing Images)](https://24ways.org/2018/dynamic-social-sharing-images/) and [**Ryan Filler** (Automatic Social Share Images)](https://www.ryanfiller.com/blog/automatic-social-share-images/), to which I have already referred in my post {% post_link 2021/Discoveries-11 %}.\n\nDrew and Ryan utilizes the Node.JS library [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), which runs a headless Chromium (or Chrome browser) over the DevTools protocol to process a web page ... for example to take a screenshot:\n\n```js\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\n(async () => {\n  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n  const page = await browser.newPage();\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n  await page.screenshot({ path: 'example.png' });\n  await browser.close();\n})();\n```\n\nThe idea is, to create a temporary HTML page with the photo and all necessary text for the social media image, take a screenshot of it and save it as PNG.\n\nAs I run my blog with [Hexo](https://hexo.io), a Static Site Generator (SSG), all information about a post is defined in a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (MD) file with some [Frontmatter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter.html) for the meta information.\n\nTherefore, the **Social Media Image Generator** script in my mind had to do following tasks:\n\n1. Iterate recursively over all MD files in Hexo ``_source/posts`` folder\n2. Read the MD's Frontmatter (for information about photo, title, subtitle and more)\n3. Create a temporary HTML file with the aid of a template\n4. Run Puppeteer script over the temporary file to take a screenshot\n5. Store the PNG to a central folder\n6. Optimize the PNG\n7. Change the meta tags in the posts to reference the new image\n\n---\n\n## The Frontmatter\n\nI pimped the Frontmatter of the original Hexo configuration a bit, in order to provide an individual photo for each post:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: Generate Social Media Images Automatically\nsubtitle:\ndate: 2021-07-10 11:07:31\nphotograph:\n  file: DSC_6776.jpg\n  name: Color Brushes\n  link: 'https://500px.com/photo/79965349'\ncategories:\n  - JavaScript\n...\n---\n```\n\nAmong other, there are the basic information, I wanted to have on my social media image: ``photograph.file`` (as the image itself) and ``title``, ``subtitle`` and ``categories`` (for the text on the image).\n\n---\n\n## The Script\n\n**The complete script, in two versions (CommonJS and ES Module) is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/social-media-image-generator).**\n\ntl;dr\n\nMy script became a JavaScript ``class``, separating the tasks in several methods and a constructor to get all necessary information as parameters. The class exports the main method ``generate()`` for calling the script:\n\n```js social-media-image-generator.cjs\nconst _currentPath = __dirname;\n\nvar _postFolder;\nvar _photoFolder;\nvar _templateFile;\nvar _targetFolder;\n\nclass Generator {\n\n  constructor(postFolder, photoFolder, templateFile, targetFolder) { \n    _postFolder = path.join(_currentPath, postFolder);\n    _photoFolder = path.join(_currentPath, photoFolder);\n    _templateFile = path.join(_currentPath, templateFile);\n    _targetFolder = path.join(_currentPath, targetFolder);\n  }\n\n  generate() { ... }\n\n  getPostFiles(dirPath, allFiles) { ... }\n\n  async processPost(fileName, vars) { ... }\n\n  async createImage(fileName, tempFile) { ... }\n}\nmodule.exports.Generator = Generator\n```\n\nI chose parameters, in order not to bind the script too tightly to my favourite SSG Hexo:\n\n* ``_postFolder`` - Where are the post files stored?\n* ``_photoFolder`` - Where are the photos stored?\n* ``_templateFile`` - Where is the template file for the temporary HTML stored?\n* ``_targetFolder`` - Where should the generated PNG files be stored?\n\n### Get the posts\n\nFirst task was to get all MD files out of the ``_postFolder`` recursively:\n\n```js social-media-image-generator.cjs\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nclass Generator {\n\n  generate() {\n    const postFiles = this.getPostFiles(_postFolder);\n  }\n\n  getPostFiles(dirPath, allFiles) {\n      // READ FOLDER CONTENT\n      let files = fs.readdirSync(dirPath);\n\n      //INIT TEMP ARRAY\n      allFiles = allFiles || [];\n\n      files.forEach((file) => {\n        if (fs.statSync(dirPath + \"/\" + file).isDirectory()) {\n          // CALL THE METHOD RECURSIVELY\n          allFiles = this.getPostFiles(dirPath + \"/\" + file, allFiles)\n        } else if (file.indexOf(\".md\")>=0) {\n          // PUSH MD FILES TO TEMP ARRAY\n          allFiles.push(path.join(dirPath, \"/\", file))\n        }\n      });\n      return allFiles;\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\n### Get the template and the temporary folder\n\nI chose [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) as the template engine to generate the temporary HTML file, because it is so easy to handle.\n\n```html social-media-image.handlebars\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <style>\n      ...\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div class=\"wrap\">\n      ...\n      <img id=\"photo\" src=\"{{photo}}\">\n      <div class=\"container\">\n        ...\n        <section id=\"title\">\n            {{#each categories}}\n            <small>{{this}}</small>\n            {{/each}}\n            <h1>{{title}}</h1>\n            {{#if subtitle}}\n            <h2>{{subtitle}}</h2>\n            {{/if}}\n        </section>\n      </div>    \n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n...\n```\n\nHandlebars is able to compile a template into a JavaScript variable, what makes it easy to reuse it. Good for performance and stability.\n\nAs I wanted to utilize the template to generate temporary HTML files, I needed a temporary folder, which can be deleted afterwards.\n\n```js social-media-image-generator.cjs\nconst handlebars = require(\"handlebars\");\n\nvar _template;\nconst _tempFolder = \"./~temp\";\n\nclass Generator {\n\n  constructor(postFolder, photoFolder, templateFile, targetFolder) { \n    \n    ...\n\n    // GET THE TEMPLATE CONTENT\n    let source = fs.readFileSync(_templateFile).toString('utf8');\n\n    // COMPILE THE TEMPLATE FOR FURTHER USE ONCE\n    _template = handlebars.compile(source);\n\n    // CREATE TEMP FOLDER IN THE WORKING DIRECTORY\n    if (!fs.existsSync(_tempFolder)) {\n      fs.mkdirSync(_tempFolder);\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\n### Process the posts\n\nSecond step was to process all the posts found.\n\n```js social-media-image-generator.cjs\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\nconst path = require(\"path\");\nconst url = require(\"url\");\nconst frontmatter = require(\"front-matter\");\n\nconst _tempFolder = \"./~temp\";\n\nclass Generator {\n\n  generate() {\n      let self = this;\n\n      const postFiles = this.getPostFiles(_postFolder);\n\n      var postsProcessed = 0;\n\n      // ITERATE OVER ALL POSTS\n      postFiles.forEach((file) => {\n        fs.readFile(file, 'utf8', function(err, data) {\n          if (err) throw err\n\n          // READ THE FRONTMATTER\n          let content = frontmatter(data);\n\n          let fileName = path.basename(file, path.extname(file));\n      \n          // only process posts with defined photograph file \n          // and if social media file is missing\n          if (content.attributes.photograph?.file && \n              !fs.existsSync(path.join(_targetFolder, fileName + \".png\"))) {\n            \n            // CALL PROCESSING METHOD\n            self.processPost(\n              fileName,\n              {\n                title: content.attributes.title, \n                subtitle: content.attributes.subtitle, \n                categories: content.attributes.categories,\n                photo: url.pathToFileURL(\n                  path.join(_photoFolder, content.attributes.photograph.file)\n                )\n              })\n              .then(() => {\n\n                // DELETE TEMP FOLDER AFTER PROCESSING\n                if (postsProcessed === postFiles.length) {\n                  fs.rmdirSync(_tempFolder, { recursive: true });\n                }\n              });\n          }\n          postsProcessed += 1;\n        })\n      });\n  }\n\n  async processPost(fileName, vars) {\n\n      // GET HTML FOR POST VIA HANDLEBARS\n      let html = _template(vars);\n\n      let tempFile = path.join(_tempFolder, fileName + \".html\");\n\n      //WRITE TEMPORARY HTML FILE\n      fs.writeFile(tempFile, html, (err) => {\n        if(err) { throw(err); }\n        //console.log(tempFile + \" saved\");\n      });\n\n      //CALL IMAGING METHOD\n      await this.createImage(fileName, tempFile);\n\n      return;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Get the image\n\nAs I had the temporary HTML file now, I only had to open up a Puppeteer instance, load the file and take the screenshot:\n\n```js\nconst puppeteer = require(\"puppeteer/cjs-entry\");\nconst imagemin = require(\"imagemin\");\nconst imageminPngquant = require(\"imagemin-pngquant\");\n\nclass Generator {\n\n  async createImage(fileName, tempFile) {\n    var self = this;\n\n    // LAUNCH CHROMIUM AND A NEW PAGE\n    const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n    const page = await browser.newPage();\n\n    // LOAD THE TEMPORARY HTML FILE\n    await page.goto(url.pathToFileURL(tempFile));\n\n    // SET THE EXACT WIDTH & HEIGHT\n    await page.setViewport({\n      width: 1200,\n      height: 630,\n      deviceScaleFactor: 1\n    });\n\n    let imgFile = path.join(_targetFolder, fileName + \".png\");\n\n    // TAKE SCREENSHOT INTO PNG FILE AT TARGET FOLDER\n    await page.screenshot({\n      path: imgFile\n    });\n\n    await browser.close();\n\n    // OPTIMIZE THE PNG FILE\n    await imagemin([imgFile], 'build', {\n      plugins: [\n        imageminPngquant({ quality: '75-90' })\n      ]\n    });\n\n    return;\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Running the script\n\nIf you already have lots of post in MD files and appropriate photographs, you can create an execution script...\n\n```js run-social-media-images.cjs\n const Generator = require(\"./social-media-image-generator.cjs\").Generator;\n\n const postFolder = process.argv[2].toString();\n const photoFolder = process.argv[3].toString();\n const templateFile = process.argv[4].toString();\n const targetFolder = process.argv[5].toString();\n\n const generator = new Generator(postFolder, photoFolder, templateFile, targetFolder);\n generator.generate();\n```\n\n... and run it as follows:\n\n```js Example execution in the console...\nnode \"./lib/run-social-media-images.cjs\" \"../source/_posts\" \"../static/photos/normal\" \"../templates/social-media-image.handlebars\" \"../static/images/social-media\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Hexo Integration\n\nIn case you are running your blog with Hexo also, you can hook on the ``ready`` event to let it run on ``hexo generate`` automatically:\n\n```js /scripts/on-ready-generate-social-media-images.js\nconst log = require('hexo-log')({\n    debug: false,\n    silent: false\n});\n\nconst Generator = require(\"../lib/social-media-image-generator.cjs\").Generator;\n\nhexo.on(\"ready\", function() {\n    \n    log.info(\"Running Social-Media-Image-Generator...\");\n\n    const postFolder = \"../source/_posts\";\n    const photoFolder = \"../static/photos/normal\";\n    const templateFile = \"../templates/social-media-image.handlebars\";\n    const targetFolder = \"../static/images/social-media\";\n\n    const generator = new Generator(postFolder, photoFolder, templateFile, targetFolder);\n    generator.generate();\n\n});\n```\n\nIt is important not to store the ``social-media-image-generator.cjs`` in Hexo's ``scripts`` folder like the event script above, because Hexo will try to execute it automatically. You have to create a different folder like ``lib`` to store and reference it from there.\n\n---\n\n## The Result\n\nHere is the result from my approach in Hexo, as I run ``hexo generate`` for this blog post:\n\n<img src=\"/images/social-media/Generate-Social-Media-Images-Automatically.png\" />\n\nThe very last thing I had to do, was to change the source of the image meta tag mentioned at the top, to reference to newly created social media image.\n\nHere's the new image in action at Twitter:\n\n![Tweet Preview](Generate-Social-Media-Images-Automatically/twitter.png)\n\n---\n\n## More Info\n\n{% moreinfo '{ \"list\": [\n  [\n    \"CSS Tricks\", \"The Essential Meta Tags for Social Media\",\n    \"https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"The Open Graph Protocol\", \"The Open Graph Protocol\",\n    \"https://opengraphprotocol.org/\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"Drew McLellan\", \"Dynamic Social Sharing Images\",\n    \"https://24ways.org/2018/dynamic-social-sharing-images/\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"Ryan Filler\", \"Automatic Social Share Images\",\n    \"https://www.ryanfiller.com/blog/automatic-social-share-images/\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"The GitHub Blog\", \"A framework for building Open Graph images\",\n    \"https://github.blog/2021-06-22-framework-building-open-graph-images/\"\n  ]\n]}' %}","tags":["Hexo","GitHub","Blogging","Imaging","ES6"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Discoveries #11","url":"/post/Discoveries-11/","content":"\nTodays issue of **Discoveries** is all about images.

Don't miss Part 2 {% post_link 2021/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Sending-Webmentions \"Hexo and the IndieWeb (Sending Webmentions)\" %} either.\n{% endalertbox %}\n\n---\n\nA meaningful interaction has always two directions: sending and receiving. In this part of the post I want to show you how to receive Webmentions from other blogs participating in the IndieWeb.\n\nAs Hexo is a SSG it generates static HTML pages. This has the advantage that the pages can be hosted just about anywhere (in my case [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but also the disadvantage of not having a real backend. Therefore, we need an external service that acts as an Webmention endpoint, where other people can send their webmentions.\n\n[Aaron Parecki](https://aaronparecki.com/), co-founder of the IndieWeb, has made a service called [**webmention.io**](https://webmention.io/) we can use for free. It is able to convert old-fashioned Pingbacks to Webmentions, supports deleting of unwanted mentions, has a Blocklist for blocking domains, Webhooks for real-time processing and last but not least an API to get all your Webmentions per page or per site.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Setup\n\nwebmention.io needs a registration and Aaron uses his own authentication method **Web Sign-In** over [IndieLogin](https://indielogin.com/) to achieve that.\n\n![IndieLogin.com](Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Receiving-Webmentions/indielogin.png)\n\nAfter you have signed in, you see your settings with two important links, you have to integrate in the head of your HTML:\n\n```html\n  <link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://webmention.io/[YOUR-BLOG-DOMAIN]/webmention\" />\n  <link rel=\"pingback\" href=\"https://webmention.io/[YOUR-BLOG-DOMAIN]/xmlrpc\" />\n```\n\nThey define your page on the one hand as a webmention- and on the other hand as a pingback endpoint. Every send Webmention or Pingback from another blog is routed to these URL's.\n\nYou will also find your **API Key** on this page. To be honest, is not a real API key, but rather a key to retrieve all incoming webmentions at once. Therefore it does not need to be kept private and secured. There is no way to modify your incoming Webmentions over it.\n\n## Incoming Webmentions\n\n{% alertbox info %}\nI'm implementing my Hexo/Webmention solution as I'm writing this post, therefore I don't have any Webmentions to show as an example. Since all mentions on webmention.io are publicly accessible, I simply use Max Böcks article [Using Webmentions in Eleventy](https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/) in the following. Max, I hope it is ok ... :)\n{% endalertbox %}\n\nAaron has defined three ways to get the incoming mentions of a particular article on your blog:\n\n### 1.

The JSON is a list and every Webmention is an entry underneath ``children``, with following useful fields:\n\n| Field | Purpose |\n| ---- | ------- |\n|``author.name``|Name of the sender|\n|``author.photo``|Avatar photo of the sender|\n|``author.url``|Personal URL of the sender|\n|``wm-id``|Unique ID of the Webmention|\n|``wm-target``|URL of your post|\n|``wm-received``|UTC Date/Time sended|\n|``wm-source``|URL of the sending post |\n|``published``|Publish Date/Time of the sending post|\n|``wm-property``|Webmention type out of the following values:<ul><li><b>mention-of</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Mention as link in post</li><li><b>in-reply-to</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Reply to your post</li><li><b>like-of</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Like of your post</li><li><b>repost-of</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Repost of your post</li><li><b>bookmark-of</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Bookmark of your post</li></ul>|\n\nOther occuring fields are optional, but no less interesting for displaying them at your post:\n\n| Field | Purpose |\n| ---- | ------- |\n|``name``|Name of the Webmention (title of the sending post or something)|\n|``summary.type``|Summary type of the Webmention, e.g. \"text/plain\"|\n|``summary.value``|Summary text of the Webmention|\n|``content.html``|Content as HTML of sending post|\n|``content.text``|Content as text of sending post|\n\nThe fact that we get the complete HTML content of the sending post, means that we easily can parse it for IndieWeb microformats (see {% post_link 2021/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb \"Part 1\" %}) to get even more information about it and the blog owner!\n\n---\n\n## Integration\n\nWe have two ways to choose from in order to integrate the data thus obtained into the post:\n\n1. Static ... means while generating the site\n2. Dynamic ... means real-time via client-side Javascript\n\nThe static approach has two big disadvantages:\n\n- The Webmentions are only visible with a time delay, due to the need of generating the pages of the site\n- Hexos generation mechanism only takes those, whose content has beed updated in the meanwhile, but do not take into account any external data like Webmentions. We would have to fire up the time consuming ``clean`` and ``generate`` all the time\n\nSo, let's go for the dynamic approach, a little bit JavaScript, which loads the Webmentions on page load (like most Commenting platforms do).\n\nFirst of all, we need a placeholder in our article.ejs, where the Webmentions will be displayed. Somewhere near the comments and implemented as another partial:\n\n```html layout/_partial/article.ejs\n\n<article id=\"<%= post.layout %>-<%= post.slug %>\" \n         class=\"article article-type-<%= post.layout %> h-entry\" itemscope itemprop=\"blogPost\">\n\n  ...\n\n  <%- partial('post/webmentions') %>\n\n  <%- partial('post/comments') %>\n  <%- partial('post/related') %>\n  <%- partial('post/nav') %>\n\n</article>\n```\n\n```html layout/_partial/post/webmentions.ejs\n<div class=\"article-webmentions\">\n\n  <div class=\"webmentions-placeholder\">\n    <p class=\"wm-placeholder\">No Webmentions yet...</p>\n  </div>\n  \n  <script>\n    window.addEventListener('load', function () {\n      insertWebmentions('<%- post.slug.toLowerCase() %>');\n    })    \n  </script>\n\n</div>\n```\n\nThe call ``insertWebmentions`` references to the asset script ``webmentions.js``, which will be bundled via Grunt in my case, but you can place it where you want and add it to your articles head element. The main thing is, that it will load when the article page is launched.\n\nThe script checks, if the user has already loaded the Webmentions for the current page from webmention.io in the last hour and do so if not, and stores the data in the browser by the pages key (slug) and with a timestamp:\n\n```js assets/webmentions.js\nfunction insertWebmentions(key) {\n  const lsTimestamp = \"wmts_\" + key;\n  const lsWebmentions = \"wm_\" + key;\n\n  const currentUrl = window.location.href;\n  const wmUrl = `https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?target=${currentUrl}&per-page=1000&sort-dir=up`;\n\n  let lastRequest;\n  let webmentions;\n\n  // Get data from browser storage, if available\n  if (localStorage.getItem(lsTimestamp) && \n    localStorage.getItem(lsWebmentions)) {\n\n    lastRequest = localStorage.getItem(lsTimestamp);\n    webmentions = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(lsWebmentions));\n  }\n\n  if(webmentions && lastRequest && Math.abs(Date.now() - lastRequest) / (60*60*1000) < 1) {\n    // Webmentions are present and not older than an hour\n    process();\n  } else {\n    // Get Webmentions from webmention.io\n    load().then(() => { process(); });\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * Load webmention.io's JSON data for the current page\n   */\n  async function load() {\n    const response = await fetch(wmUrl);\n    webmentions = await response.json();\n    localStorage.setItem(lsWebmentions, JSON.stringify(webmentions));\n    localStorage.setItem(lsTimestamp, Date.now());\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Process Webmentions\n   */\n  function process() {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nActually the script loads the first 1000 Webmentions in ascending order of their retreiving date. Should last for a while or I may feel like adding real paging at some point ;)\n\nOn processing the webmentions, a separate HTML block is generated for each type (``wm-property``) regarding the content of the Webmention, whereby the header is always the same. The ``VERB`` refers to the Webmentions type: *mentioned*, *replied*, *liked*, *bookmarked* or *reposted*.\n\n```html HEADER\n<div class=\"wm-card h_card\">\n  <a class=\"wm-photo-link u-url\" href=\"[AUTHOR.URL]\">\n    <img class=\"wm-photo u-photo\" width=\"44\" height=\"44\" \n          src=\"[AUTHOR.PHOTO]\" alt=\"[AUTHOR.NAME]\">\n  </a>\n  <div class=\"wm-meta\">\n    <a class=\"wm-name p-name\" href=\"[AUTHOR.URL]\">[AUTHOR.NAME]</a>\n    <span class=\"wm-verb\">[VERB] on</span>\n    <time class=\"wm-date dt-published\" datetime=\"[WM-RECEIVED]\">\n      [formatted WM-RECEIVED]\n    </time>\n    <small>[Running Number]</small>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe HTML of the five implemented types:\n\n```html MENTION\n<div class=\"webmention wm-mentioned\" id=\"[WM-ID]\">\n  [HEADER HTML]\n  <div class=\"wm-content p-content\">\n    <p>[First 50 words of CONTENT.TEXT with ellipsis]</p>\n    <a class=\"wm-source\" href=\"[WM-SOURCE]\">[WM-SOURCE]</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```html REPLY\n<div class=\"webmention wm-mentioned\" id=\"[WM-ID]\">\n  [HEADER HTML]\n  <div class=\"wm-content p-content\">\n    <p>[Complete CONTENT.HTML]</p>\n    <a class=\"wm-source\" href=\"[WM-SOURCE]\">[WM-SOURCE]</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```html LIKE & BOOKMARK (no content)\n<div class=\"webmention wm-mentioned\" id=\"[WM-ID]\">\n  [HEADER HTML]\n</div>\n```\n\n```html REPOST\n<div class=\"webmention wm-mentioned\" id=\"[WM-ID]\">\n  [HEADER HTML]\n  <div class=\"wm-content p-content\">\n    <p>\n      ... at <a href=\"[WM-SOURCE]\">[WM-SOURCE]</a>\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe result will look like this, after adding some styles:\n\n![Webmention example](Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Receiving-Webmentions/wm-example.png)\n\nYou can download the complete JavaScript- and the Stylus file on Github:  \n[**https://github.com/kristofzerbe/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Files**](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Files)\n\n---\n\n### Form for sending Webmentions manually\n\nAs you may noticed in {% post_link 2021/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Sending-Webmentions \"Part 2\" %}, some manual work is necessary to have webmentions sent. Therefore, it is good to give the user a possibility to submit his blog post, where he mentions yours, directly. As webmentions.io supports posting a new source, the HTML form is quite simple an we can integrate it in the partial from above, below the script tag:\n\n```html layout/_partial/post/webmentions.ejs\n<div class=\"article-webmentions\">\n\n  ...\n\n  <form class=\"webmention-form\" \n        action=\"https://webmention.io/<%- config.title %>>/webmention\" \n        name=\"webmention-form\" method=\"post\">\n    \n    <label for=\"webmention-form-source\">Your Article URL:</label><br>\n    <input class=\"webmention-form-source\" \n          type=\"url\" name=\"source\" \n          placeholder=\"https://your-blog.com/your-article\" required=\"\">\n    \n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"target\" value=\"<%- post.permalink %>>\">\n    \n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send Webmention\">\n  \n  </form>\n\n</div>\n```\n\nThe variable ``config.title`` defines the name of your blog with which you have registered at webmention.io. In the hidden input, we use the permalink of the current page/article as the mentions target.\n\n---\n\n## Building Bridges\n\nYes, the IndieWeb and Webmentions are an alternative concept of social networking, bypassing the big silos like Facebook, Twitter and Co. ... but they exist and they have a massive reach. Of course, your posts will be shared there, so why not include those mentions?\n\n[**Bridgy**](https://brid.gy/) is such a bridge builder. It connects your blog with the big social media players:\n\n![Bridgy](Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Receiving-Webmentions/bridgy.png)\n\nThe only thing you have to do, is to allow Bridgy to access your social media data, like your Tweets on Twitter. If somebody mentions you and one of your articles as a Tweet, Reply or Like, it sends a mention to the endpoint defined in your HTML, in our case webmention.io. Thats it ... kinda magic.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nSome people say, Webmentions makes commenting forms on blogs, like Disqus or others, obsolete, but I don't agree with that, because not every visitor owns a blog and not every blog owner want's to write a post only to comment the thoughts of another blogger. Both approaches work well side by side and complement each other. Webmentions are super to build a blog network and  increasing your blogs coverage.

You want to send **Webmentions**.\n\nGood news: you don't have to write your own solution to scan your article for external URL's and sending Webmentions to their creators: [Remy Sharp has done that](https://remysharp.com/2019/06/18/send-outgoing-webmentions) already with his service [**webmention.app**](https://webmention.app/). It supports the long existing [Pingbacks](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback) too and offers several ways to achieve your goal:\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n**(1)** *Use the service at [https://webmention.app/test](https://webmention.app/test) manually with your newly published article URL*   \nVery time consuming approach and actually only intended for tests.

Rely on Remy's service and needs a token.\n\n**(3)** *Use IFTTT to do the job described in (2) using your feed*   \nSeems best way for 'set up and forget', but you rely not only on Remy's service, but on IFTTT also. Not really controllable.\n\n**(4)** ***Use his Command line tool independently***   \nUse the executable behind Remy's service on your own, without tokens and stuff.

But what makes Facebook, Twitter and others \"social\" is the interaction between the people. Likes, Retweets, Mentions, Replies are the fuel which drives them. But most of the blogging solutions offers only rudimentary interactions, in form of article comments. The comment hurdle is high because interacting on someone else's site is different from interacting on what is supposed to be your own, such as your Twitter or Facebook feed.\n\nThe project [**IndieWeb**](https://indieweb.org/) and their approach of [**Webmentions**](https://indieweb.org/Webmention), has the goal to fill this gap. As a [W3C recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/), it defines standards how the social interaction of independent blogging solutions can be technically implemented without the need of manual intervention. Let software do the job...\n\nIn this article I will only briefly go into the basics and then show an implementation solution for the SSG [**Hexo**](https://hexo.io).\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n---\n\n## Basic Concepts\n\nNothing describes the flow of Webmentions better than this:\n\n{% blockquote_alt \"Drew McLellan\" \"https://allinthehead.com/retro/378/implementing-webmentions\" %}\n1. Frankie posts a blog entry.\n2. Alex has thoughts in response, so also posts a blog entry linking to Frankie’s.\n3. Alex’s publishing software finds the link and fetches Frankie’s post, finding the URL of Frankie’s Webmention endpoint in the document.\n4. Alex’s software sends a notification to the endpoint.\n5. Frankie’s software then fetches Alex’s post to verify that it really does link back, and then chooses how to display the reaction alongside Frankie’s post.\n{% endblockquote_alt %}\n\nBasically Webmentions allow notifications between **web addresses**, therefore every post, which is part of the interaction, has to have a unique [permalink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink).\n\nA blog software that wants to support webmentions must cover 4 main points:\n\n1. The HTML has to tell others who you are\n2. The HTML has to give dedicated informations about your posts\n3. Sending a message to another blog, in case you mentioned one of its posts\n4. Reveiving messages from other blogs, in case they mentioned one of your posts\n\nPoint 4 is probably the most interesting for all of us, because it pats our own ego on the back, since we usually don't write for ourselves, but for others, and reactions to it, show us that it wasn't pointless.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: The Personal & Profile HTML\n\nAs you want to interact with other blogs participating in the IndieWeb with your posts, they have to know something about you and your articles in a machine-readable form.\n\n### Personal Information\n\nHTML is machine-readable per se, but you have to tell others what to look for by adding defined classes to the tags which holds the information, in order to enable them to get specific information about you, like your name, your mail-address or links to other profiles f.e. Github, Twitter and so on.\n\nIt is necessary to have this information not only in an ABOUT page, but also on each post page. You can achieve this either by having an ABOUT block like here on kiko.io or providing the information in hidden HTML tags elsewhere in your HTML.\n\nIt does not matter which tags you use, you only have to add the defined class to the tag of a particular information in your Hexo EJS file. The information will be extracted out of the tag's inner text.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nThe most used classes for personal blogs as follows:\n\n|Class|Information|\n|---|---|\n|[**h-card**](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card)|Wrapper for all personal information.<br> *All other classes below has to be used on child tags*|\n|**p-name**|Full name|\n|**u-email**|Email address|\n|**u-photo**|Photo|\n|**p-role**|Role|\n|**u-url**|URL representing the person|\n|**p-locality**|City or Town|\n|**p-region**|State or province|\n|**p-country-name**|Country name|\n\n{% alertbox exclamation %}\nPlease keep in mind not to give too much information about you to the public. It could get unpleasant...\n{% endalertbox %}\n\n### Profile Information\n\nFor providing links to other profiles, anchor (``A``) tags with the special attribute [``rel=\"me\"``](http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me) will be used, which indicates profile equivalence and can be used for [identity-consolidation](http://microformats.org/wiki/identity-consolidation).\n\nWith this extension of your blog HTML, you are able to sign in using your domain at sites which supports **Web Sign-In** over the concept of **RelMeAuth**, for example those who use [**IndieAuth.net - OAuth for the open web**](https://indieauth.net/). You only have to make sure, that the endpoints of your profile links have **backlinks to your blog** with a ``rel=\"me``\". Unfortunately, not many services offer the definition of such a backlink. Github, for example, is an exception. You can give it a try at [IndieAuth.com](https://indieauth.com/).\n\n#### Example\n\n![About markup](Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb/about-markup.png)\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: The Article HTML\n\nTagging articles with meta information for the IndieWeb is similarly simple, by adding following classes in your article.ejs file:\n\n|Class|Information|\n|---|---|\n|[**h-entry**](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry)|Wrapper for all article related information|\n|**p-name**|Title|\n|**p-summary**|Short summary|\n|**e-content**|Content| \n|**dt-published**|Publish date|\n|**dt-updated**|Update date|\n|**u-url**|Permalink|\n\nIn case you work with the default Hexo theme 'landscape', I advise you to split your ``article.ejs`` in two files, because it is used for the article itself and for the excerpts on the start page and archive pages also. I have made an ``excerpt.ejs`` with all the information needed for listing the posts and cut back my ``article.ejs`` to the bare minimum, but with the IndieWeb related classes above (or in the linked partials if necessary), because only the article page itself should have these informations, respectively an ``h-entry`` class, to indicate that there are IndieWeb data!\n\n```html layout/_partial/article.ejs\n\n<article id=\"<%= post.layout %>-<%= post.slug %>\" \n         class=\"article article-type-<%= post.layout %> h-entry\" itemscope itemprop=\"blogPost\">\n  \n  <div class=\"article-meta\">\n\n    <div class=\"h-card p-author\" style=\"display:none\">\n      <img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"<%- config.photo %>\" alt=\"<%- config.author %>\" />\n      <a class=\"p-name u-url\" href=\"<%- config.url %>\" rel=\"author\"><%- config.author %></a>\n    </div>\n\n    <%- partial('post/date', { class_name: 'article-date dt-published', date_format: 'DD MMM YYYY' }) %>\n    <%- partial('post/category', { class_name: 'article-category p-category' }) %>\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"article-inner\">\n    <header class=\"article-header\">\n      <%- partial('post/title', { class_name: 'article-title p-name', show_link: false }) %>\n      <%- partial('post/subtitle', { class_name: 'article-subtitle p-summary' }) %>\n    </header>\n    \n    <div class=\"article-entry

%>\n\n</article>\n```\n\n### External Links\n\nThe Interaction with other blogs takes place through linking to those external sources in the content of your article.\n\nLets say you want to write about a specific topic and to mention the work of another developer, then you just place a link to his post in your Markdown, as you have been doing all along:\n\n```md /source/_posts/my-fancy-post.md\n# My Fancy Post\n...\nJack has done a wonderful job with his [Awesome Work](https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work)\n...\n```\n\nIt will be transformed while generating

To group these articles I considered using the build-in ``categories``, but I already used them to group articles by the underlying tech stack or area, like ´JavaScript´, ´C#´ or ´Tools´ and I didn't want to mix it, as the category was also used in the Url of a post.\n\nI was researching another grouping solution for Hexo and stumbled upon [hexo-index-anything](https://github.com/leviwheatcroft/hexo-index-anything), a very clever Hexo plugin to generate index pages for almost every [FrontMatter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter.html) variable in a post.\n\nAs it was freely available under a MIT license on Github, I forked it in July 2020 and made some bug fixes and drop a pull request to Levi ... but he  unfortunately never answered my pull or issue requests and has set the status of the project to DEPRECATED.\n\nOk then ... make a successor on your own, fella...\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Basic Functionality\n\nLet me describe how the original plugin and my successor are working in general:\n\nAssume, you have several posts from different authors and you want a list of all posts for every author. The only thing you have to do (after installation and configuration of the plugin), is to add a custom variable called ``author`` to the FrontMatter of each post, with the name of the author as value.\n\n```yml /source/_posts/my-fancy-post.md\ntitle: My Fancy Post\ndate: 2021-04-25 13:41:46\nauthor: Kristof\n...\n```\n\nNext time you run ``hexo generate``, several new files will be available in your output folder:\n\n**One INDEX page**\n\n... for the **author index**, with a list of all available authors and the number of the posts:\n* /authors/index.html\n\n**Many POSTS pages**\n\n..., one for each author for the **author index**, with all of the authors posts:\n\n* /authors/kristof/index.html\n* /authors/ ... /index.html\n\n## New Plugin Name\n\nIn order to avoid confusion (and be able to provide the plugin on Github/NPM) I needed a new name for the plugin and due to the fact that it is a generator, I named it simply **hexo-generator-anything**.\n\n## New Features\n\nThe original code was really hard to read, because every second variable was named 'index', therefore I started with some refactorings, before I continued implementing new features.\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe original, one-dimensional variable to index mapping, wasn't meaningful enough for me. The new mapping is now a dictionary and has unique identifiers:\n\n```yml /_config.yml\nanything:\n  layout_index: anything-index\n  layout_posts: anything-posts\n  index_mappings:\n    - variable: author\n      path: authors\n```\n\nThe ``template*`` setting names has changed into ``layout_*``, to make more clear what they are meant for. They are pointing to an existing EJS file in your Hexo themes layout folder to render the particular page.\n\n* ``layout_index``   \nEJS file (without extension) to render the INDEX page\n\n* ``layout_Posts``   \nEJS file (without extension) to render each POSTS page\n\nOn [Github](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/hexo-generator-anything) and in the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-generator-anything) you will find sample EJS files and some partials, to take the SoC pattern into account.\n\nThe original ``titleSeparator`` setting is not longer available, because it is not necessary anymore. By providing a data structure for ``index`` with the attributes ``name`` and ``caption``, a title can be put together in the EJS file itself.\n\n### Introducing linked Markdown files\n\nOne of my needs was, to provide more information on the INDEX page and the POSTS pages for each entry or, to stay with the example, for each author. As the ``_posts`` folder is used for storing the post data files, I introduced a **``_anything``** folder for dropping MD files, which are linked to the index and its values.\n\n![Anything folder](Forking-Hexo-plugin-hexo-index-anything/anything-folder.png)\n\nThe subfolders of **``_anything``** are representing the index and the files in it each possible value of the index.\n\nThe file is structured like any other post file: the FrontMatter data at the top and below some content to show along with the the entry to describe it:\n\n```yml /source/_anything/authors/kristof.md\n---\ntitle: Kristof\ngithub: https://github.com/kristofzerbe\navatar: kristof.png\n---\n\n... some smart things to say about Kristof, or links or images, whatever ...\n```\n\nThe INDEX file itself may have its own Markdown file, to provide addition text or data to it, like describing the list.\n\nThe variable ``title`` is a requirement in the Markdown files, but you can add as many variables as you need and use it in the EJS files. All data will be passed through to the template.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe new plugin runs very well and it is heavy in use on generating the sections [Series](https://kiko.io/series) and [Projects](https://kiko.io/projects) of this blog.

This sometimes works, but most of the time it doesn't, because website owners often don't pay attention to reasonable ``<meta>`` tags.\n\nBecause it is easier to find a card with visual support, I create my own screenshots for the cards in a manual, but streamlined, process, I want to show you here.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nOS:\n* **Android** 5 and above \n\nApps:\n  * **Trello**  \n  [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trello](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trello)  \n\n  * **Screenshot Touch**  \n  [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mdiwebma.screenshot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mdiwebma.screenshot)\n\n---\n\n## Step 1\n- Open up **Screenshot Touch** and set under ``Shaking and Delay`` the option ``Caption by shaking`` **[1]**.\n- Set the ``Shake sensitivity`` option to ``Hard`` **[2]**.\n- Set the ``Resize`` option to ``50%`` **[3]**.\n- Start the capture monitoring service **[4]**.  \n\n![Step 1](Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/step-01.png)\n\n---\n\n## Step 2\n- Open up **Trello** and got to the card, where you want to add an screenshot for use as an cover.\n- Click on the URL attachment to open it in your browser **[1]**.\n\n![Step 2](Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/step-02.png)\n\n---\n\n## Step 3\n- Shake you smartphone to capture the current website.\n\n![Step 3](Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/step-03.png)\n\n---\n\n## Step 4\n- Switch to **Screenshot Touch** and open the ``Photo Viewer`` **[1]**\n\n![Step 4](Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/step-04.png)\n\n---\n\n## Step 5\n- Open the ``Crop Image`` dialog.\n\n![Step 5](Adding-Screenshots-to-Trello-Cards-on-Android/step-05.png)\n\n---\n\n## Step 6\n- Set the ``Crop Mode`` to ``1:1`` to get a squared image.

From BMP files to GIF and JPG files, PNG files, to complete or customizable symbol fonts like [fontello.com](https://fontello.com), to Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).\n\nSVG's in particular are becoming increasingly popular, because they are nothing more than XML-like code, that can be manipulated via CSS or JS, their digital footprint is unbeatable small and they scale seemlessly.\n\nDealing with SVG's is a little bit more difficult than placing a PNG in HTML, because of its complexity, but it is worth learning as much as possible about it. So did I in the last couple of month and I want to share my finds on the web with you in this post.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Using SVG's in brief\n\nThe most useful way of using SVG's is as an image out of a file, either directly ...:\n\n<button><img src=\"options.svg\" /></button><br><em>(use DevTools [F12] to inspect the element)</em>\n\n```html\n<img src=\"images/options.svg\" />\n```\n\n... or as a background image:\n\n<style>\n  button.options {\n    height: 56px;\n    width: 56px;\n    background-image: url(options.svg);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-position: 50% 50%;\n  }\n</style>\n<button class=\"options\"></button><br><em>(use DevTools [F12] to inspect the element)</em>\n\n```html\n<style>\n  button.options {\n    height: 56px;\n    width: 56px;\n    background: url(images/options.svg);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-position: 50% 50%;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<button class=\"options\"></button>\n```\n\nAs files, no matter how small, has to be requested from the server, you can also define SVG's inline for better performance:\n\n<div>\n<button>\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n      width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24

It is absolutely fundamental to have a protection layer, which filters out unwanted data requests.  \n\nA common way is to limit the service access by providing API Keys to well known clients. In this post I will show you how to implement such a filter in terms of API keys and IP addresses. \n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## The Settings\n\nLets start with the list of clients, who should be able to access the data. The most useful place for this is in the **appsettings.json** of the Core 5.0 Web API project:\n\n```json appsettings.json\n...\n\n\"Callers\": [\n    {\n      \"Name\": \"localhost\",\n      \"ApiKey\": null,\n      \"IPAddress\": \"::1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"ApiKey\": \"mytopsecretapikeyforjohndoe\",\n      \"IPAddress\":  \"*\"\n    }\n  ]\n...\n```\n\nThis list has two entries: one for the server itself (\"localhost\"), which is restricted to the local IP address ``\"::1\"``, and one for the test user ``\"John Doe\"``, who can access from any IP address (``\"*\"``), but must supply his personal API key with his requests.\n\nIn order to handle this setting, we have to introduce it to the system at startup as a class:\n\n```c# CallerSetting.cs\n  public class CallerSetting\n  {\n      public string Name { get; set; }\n      public string ApiKey { get; set; }\n      public string IPAddress { get; set; }\n  }\n```\n\n```c# Startup.cs\n...\n\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) \n{\n  ...\n\n  IConfigurationSection configSection = Configuration.GetSection(\"Callers\");\n  services.Configure<List<CallerSetting>>(configSection);\n\n}\n...\n```\n\n## The Controller\n\nLet's assume we have a controller, which handles the API requests, like this:\n\n```c# MyFancyController.cs\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\n\nnamespace MyAPIProject\n{\n    [Route(\"api/helloworld\")]\n    [ApiController]\n    public class MyFancyAPIController : ControllerBase\n    {\n        [HttpGet]\n        public string Get()\n        {\n            return \"Hello World\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo prevent to write a request check against our new settings in each action method, we can decorate the whole controller class by introducing an new custom ``Attribute``, which will do the work:\n\n```c# MyFancyController.cs\n...\n\n[Route(\"api/helloworld\")]\n[ApiController]\n[AuthenticateApiRequest]\npublic class MyFancyAPIController : ControllerBase\n...\n```\n\n## The Attribute\nHere is the code for the new attribute. It uses the ``IActionFilter``. These filters run within the ASP.NET Core action invocation pipeline, in our case BEFORE the action is entered (``OnActionExecutionAsync``).\n\n```c# AuthenticateApiRequestAttribute.cs\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing System.Linq;\n\nnamespace MyAPIProject\n{\n  [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]\n  public class AuthenticateApiRequestAttribute : Attribute, IAsyncActionFilter\n  {\n    public async Task OnActionExecutionAsync\n    (\n      ActionExecutingContext context, \n      ActionExecutionDelegate next\n    )\n    {\n      // Get an Api Key from Request Header\n      context.HttpContext.Request.Headers.TryGetValue(\n        \"ApiKey\", out var requestApiKey\n      );\n\n      // Get the remote IP Address\n      var requestIpAddress = \n        context.HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress.ToString();\n\n      // Get access to 'appsettings.json'\n      var appSettings = \n        context.HttpContext.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<IConfiguration>();\n\n      // Get 'Callers' list from settings\n      var callers = appSettings.GetSection(\"Callers\")\n        .Get<List<CallerSetting>>();\n\n      // Get all Callers with matching IP Adress and/or API Key via LINQ\n      var current = callers.Where(c => \n        (c.IPAddress == requestIpAddress) || \n        (c.IPAddress == \"*\" && c.ApiKey == requestApiKey) ||\n        (c.IPAddress == requestIpAddress && c.ApiKey == requestApiKey));\n      \n      // Do we have a match?\n      if (current.Count() == 0)\n      {\n        // No, then return with an error \n        context.Result = new ContentResult()\n        {\n          StatusCode = 401,\n          Content = \"Unauthorized Access\"\n        };\n        return;\n      } \n\n      await next(); \n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## The Result\n\n![Test Request with Nightingale](Custom-Caller-Authentication-with-ASP-NET-Core-5-0-WebApi/api-request-nightingale.png)\n\n## More Info\n\n{% moreinfo '{ \"list\": [\n  [\n    \"Microsoft Docs\", \"Filters in ASP.NET Core\",\n    \"https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters?view=aspnetcore-5.0\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"Microsoft Docs\", \"Configuration in ASP.NET Core\",\n    \"https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-5.0\"\n  ]\n]}' %}","tags":["Visual Studio","WebAPI","Authentication"],"categories":[".NET"]},{"title":"Discoveries #7","url":"/post/Discoveries-7/","content":"\nFebruary and the first sunny days in 2021.

In this article I want to show you my approach on this...\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nMy solution is based on a template system that I implemented into my project at an earlier stage. If you are interested in how this works, I recommend you read my article **[Utilize a repository of reusable ES6 template literals](https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/Utilize-a-repository-of-reusable-ES6-template-literals/)**.\n\nLet's start with the standard scaffold of an HTML5 app, extended with some ``style``'s, an initialization ``script`` and a lonely ``main`` element, we want to fill with some localized content:\n\n```html index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n        <meta http-equiv=\"language\" content=\"en\">\n\n        <title>Native JavaScript Multilanguage Templating</title>\n\n        <style>\n            body { padding: 2rem; }\n            main { text-align: center; }\n        </style>\n\n        <script type=\"module\">\n            import { App } from './app.js';\n            window.app = new App(); \n            app.init();\n        </script>\n\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n        <main></main>\n    </body>\n\n</html>\n```\n\nThe ``script`` points to the following ES6 module class in the file **app.js**:\n\n```js app.js\nclass App {\n\n  constructor() { \n    // do something when the class is instantiated\n  }\n\n  init() {\n    // do something to initialize the app\n  }\n}\nexport { App };\n```\n\nNothing uncommon so far, if you are familiar with [ES6 classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) and [imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)/[exports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export). \n\nNow let's create a **localizations.js** file, to store the needed localized strings in all wanted languages. Every language will have its own branch in a ``Localizations`` object, represented by its two-letter [ISO-639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). All translations are accessible via an unique english key word:\n\n```js localizations.js\nexport function Localizations() {\n    return {\n        \"EN\": {\n            \"helloWorld\": \"Hello World\"\n        },\n        \"DE\": {\n            \"helloWorld\": \"Hallo Welt\"\n        },\n        \"ES\": {\n            \"helloWorld\": \"Hola, mundo\"\n        },\n        \"FR\": {\n            \"helloWorld\": \"Bonjour le monde\"\n        },\n        \"RU\": {\n            \"helloWorld\": \"Здравствуйте, мир\"\n        },\n        \"JP\": {\n            \"helloWorld\": \"ハローワールド\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs we import the **localizations.js** in our **app.js**, we can initialize the localizations in the constructor of the app class with the language code of the users browser:\n\n```js app.js\nimport { Localizations } from './localizations.js';\n\nclass App {\n\n  constructor() { \n    \n    // Get browser language\n    this.langCode = \n      window.navigator.language.split(\"-\")[0].toUpperCase();\n\n    // Init localization to access via 'app.localization' globally\n    this.localization = Localizations()[this.langCode];\n\n  }\n\n  ...\n```\n\n``app.localization`` now holds the key/value list of the current language.\n\nNow we implement the templating class, as described in [Utilize a repository of reusable ES6 template literals](https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/Utilize-a-repository-of-reusable-ES6-template-literals/) and define a first template called ``helloWorld`` ...\n\n```js templates.js\nclass Templates {\n\n    helloWorld(data) {\n        return this.fillTemplate(`\n            <h1>${app.localization.helloWorld}</h1>\n        `, data);\n    }\n\n    fillTemplate(templateString, templateVars){\n        var func = new Function(...Object.keys(templateVars),  \n          \"return `\" + templateString + \"`;\");\n        return func(...Object.values(templateVars));\n    }\n}\nexport { Templates };\n```\n\nThe inner text of the ``h1`` element in the ``helloWorld`` template refers to the globally available variable ``app.localization``, we initialized in the last step, and points to the translation ``helloWorld``.\n\nIn **app.js** we import the **templates.js** and implement some code in the ``init`` method, to get the template and bring it to the DOM:\n\n```js app.js\nimport { Localizations } from './localizations.js';\nimport { Templates } from './templates.js';\n\nclass App {\n\n  ...\n\n  init() { \n\n    // Get \"Hello World\" H1 element in current language\n    let helloWorld = app.templates.helloWorld({});\n\n    //Insert H1 element into MAIN element\n    document.querySelector(\"main\")\n      .insertAdjacentHTML(\"beforeend\", helloWorld);\n\n  }\n```\n\nThis is it ...\n\nIn the following **Github** repository you will find a solution based on this example, extented with a language selector, cookie support and some helper methods to keep the code nice and clean:\n\n  [https://github.com/kristofzerbe/Native-JavaScript-Multilanguage-Templating](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/Native-JavaScript-Multilanguage-Templating)\n\n![](Native-JavaScript-Multilanguage-Templating/github-solution.gif)","tags":["Localization","ES6","Templating"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Remote Testing and Debugging with Chrome","url":"/post/Remote-Testing-and-Debugging-with-Chrome/","content":"\nDeveloping a website or web app means, you have installed an editor locally on your computer, writing your code locally and start a tiny, built-in web server for debugging locally in your preferred browser.

You need to \"announce\" this address to your mobile device by using the mechanism called **Port Forwarding**. This is a job for the browser...\n\n1. Connect you mobile device via USB with your local machine\n\n2. Open up **[chrome://inspect/#devices](chrome://inspect/#devices)** in your Chromium based browser (works in all Chromium browsers)\n\n3.

The shade is grey, boring and has been used and seen many times before...\n\nAn design related [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIXUIXkBHMk/) from Muhammad Abdull of [thewilsonthings](https://www.instagram.com/thewilsonwings), inspired me to **use the image itself as the shadow** in order to make the image look a bit translucent. Should be the same technique as that of a reflection. Here is the HTML/CSS code for it, as the people asking for it in the comments.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nWhat we want to achieve is this:\n\n![Duplicate Image Shadow](Use-a-duplicate-image-to-drop-a-shadow/image-shadow.jpg)\n\nBasically, we use a duplicate of the image and position it below the actual image, but slightly offset and blurred. It won't be a performance issue, as some might think, because it is the very same file and will be loaded only once by the browser.\n\nFor showing two images in the nearly same place in different layers, we need a wrapper...\n\n```html\n<div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n  <img src=\"my-image.jpg\" />\n  <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"my-image.jpg\" />\n</div>\n```\n\n... and some CSS for positioning the images on top of each other first. Here are the defaults for both ``image`` elements:\n\n```css\ndiv.image-wrapper {\n  position: relative;\n}\n\ndiv.image-wrapper img {\n  position: absolute;\n  display: block;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  z-index: 1;\n}\n```\n\nNow we have to style the duplicate image that it looks similar to the shadow. We washing it out using the [blur filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/blur) and the opacity.\n\n```css\ndiv.image-wrapper img.shadow {\n  filter: blur(10px);\n  opacity: 0.8;\n}\n```\n\n![Blurred Duplicate](Use-a-duplicate-image-to-drop-a-shadow/blurred-image.jpg)\n\nLast step is to change the duplicates dimensions and the positioning below the original image. We squeeze it by 10% and shift it from left with half of the value back to the center, shift it from top to make it standout at the bottom and send it to the back by taking a lower z-index than the original image.\n\n```css\ndiv.image-wrapper img.shadow {\n  filter: blur(10px);\n  opacity: 0.8;\n\n  width: 90%;\n  left: 5%;\n  top: 40px;\n  z-index: 0;\n}\n```\n\nThats it. Here's a pen to play around with the solution:\n\n{% codepen \"XWjGBGy\" \"Image Shadows\" css %}\n","tags":["CSS"],"categories":["UI/UX"]},{"title":"Safely remove multiple classes using a prefix","url":"/post/Safely-remove-multiple-classes-using-a-prefix/","content":"Writing a Web App with HTML and JavaScript means you deal with several classes on your DOM elements in order to visualize state changes. And there are some pitfalls to be aware of with regard to removal.\n\nAssuming you want to open some kind of sidebar above a container. In this sidebar you have several buttons to show different content via JavaScript and a close button, which closes the sidebar again. You HTML code maybe looks like this:\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"container\">... Main Content ...</div>\n\n    <nav>\n      <button id=\"open-sidebar\">\n    </nav>\n\n    <aside id=\"sidebar\">\n      <div class=\"content\">... Sidebar Content ...</div>\n      <button id=\"close\">Close Sidebar</button>\n      <button id=\"content1\">Show Content 1</button>\n      <button id=\"content2\">Show Content 2</button>\n      <button id=\"content3\">Show Content 3</button>\n    </aside>\n\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nBy clicking on the ``open-sidebar`` button, the sidebar is opened and the action, respectively the new state, is vizualized by adding an appropriate class to the parent sidebar element. In order to make it easy for the user, the default content (Content 1) will be loaded also and its state will be marked with another class.\n\n```html\n<aside class=\"sidebar open open-content1\">\n```\n\nA click on of the other content buttons (let's say Content 2), will replace the current content and the ``aside`` classes will change into:\n\n```html\n<aside class=\"sidebar open open-content2\">\n```\n\nNow we want to close the sidebar again, assuming that we don't have stored the currently opened content in the JavaScript code...\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nWhat we have to do, is to iterate over all classes of ``aside`` and remove those which starts with ``open``:\n\n```js\nlet sidebar = document.getElementById(\"sidebar\");\nfor (let i = 0; i < sidebar.classList.length; i++) {\n  let value = sidebar.classList[i];\n  if (value.startsWith(\"open\")) {\n    sidebar.classList.remove(value);\n  }\n}\n\n//or\n\nlet sidebar = document.getElementById(\"sidebar\");\nsidebar.classList.forEach(function(value){\n  if(value.includes(\"open\")) {\n    sidebar.classList.remove(value);\n  };\n}); \n```\n\nBoth approaches have a pitfall: when the first class, starting with ``open``, is removed from the list, the length of the ``classList`` array changes immediatly and we won't reach the last class in the list ... !\n\nThe solution is to find and remove all appropriate classes at once, for example by using ``RegEx`` and a reusable helper function:\n\n```js\nfunction removeClassByPrefix(el, prefix) {\n  let pattern = '(' + prefix + '(\\\\s|(-)?(\\\\w*)(\\\\s)?)).*?';\n  var regEx = new RegExp(pattern, 'g');\n  el.className = el.className.replace(regEx, '');\n}\n\n//...\n\nlet sidebar = document.getElementById(\"sidebar\");\nremoveClassByPrefix(sidebar, \"open\");\n```\n\n### Update, 24 Jan 2021\n\nThe first posted RegEx pattern didn't worked properly, because it has found the prefix only and not the whole word, so I have updated the pattern.\n\nYou can try it out at [RegExr.com - Remove Class By Prefix](https://regexr.com/5ktn3).\n","tags":["DOM"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Use and manage multiple Node.js versions on Windows 10","url":"/post/Use-and-manage-multiple-Node-js-versions-on-Windows-10/","content":"\nFor a new project I needed to have Node 14 running on my Windows 10 machine, so installation was done quickly via downloading and running the setup file.\n\nA short time later I wanted to write a new blog post here on kiko.io, which depends on the Node.js based static site generator [Hexo](https://hexo.io) ... and ran into several problems.\n\nFirst of all my hero image processing script (see {% post_link 2020/Automatic-Header-Images-in-Hexo %}) returned an exception.

So ... on every init, another event listener is added.\n\nYou can easily figure that out, by calling `getEventListeners(document)` in the Chrome DevTools:\n\n![Chrome DevTools: Multiple Event Listeners](How-to-prevent-duplicate-events/chromedevtools-multiple-listeners.png)\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nAs there is no way in JS to find and replace the event which was previously added, we have to remove the existing event by using ``removeEventListener`` and add it again.

Gone are the days of endless string concatination or replacing variables in a string by using RegEx.\n\nInstead of... \n\n```js\nvar url = ...\nvar file = ...\n\nvar template = \n  '<div class=\"photo\">' + \n     '<a href=\"' + url + \"' + \n        'style=\"background-image: url(' + file + ')\"</a>' + \n  '</div>'\n```\n\n... you can write:\n\n```js\nvar url = ...\nvar file = ...\n\nvar template = `\n  <div class=\"photo\">\n    <a href=\"${url}/\"\n    style=\"background-image: url(${file});\"></a>\n  </div>\n`,\n```\n\nIt's much cleaner and easier to handle, as you can copy your needed HTML right into your code and surround it by **backtick** (!) characters. Insert your variable placeholders (expressions), indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces, and you are done.\n\nBut there is one \"restriction\", you have to be aware of: the interpolation (substitution of the expressions) is done at declaration time and not at runtime. You can't define your literals seperatly, take one and make your substitution as you need it, like you would do with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) or other templating engines. Therefore the name *template* literals is a bit misleading. But ... there is a way to achieve this anyway...\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Tagged Templates\n\nBeside Template Literals, ES6 introduced **Tagged Templates** (exact: Tagged Template Literals). These tags are functions, which allows you to parse a Template Literal. Definition is like this:\n\n```js\nfunction myTag(literals, ...expressions) {\n  //do the substitution and return a string\n}\n```\n\nYou can use these tags by prefixing you literal:\n```js\nmyTag`Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}!`\n```\n\nUsing Tagged Templates to build a template repository would mean, you have to write one tag function for every template ... doable, but time consuming.\n\n## Dynamic Tag Function\n\nTo avoid this, we can write a universal tag function, which utilizes the [Function constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function), to create the tag function dynamically:\n\n```js\nfunction fillTemplate(templateString, templateVars) {\n\n  var func = new Function(\n    ...Object.keys(templateVars),  \n    \"return `\" + templateString + \"`;\")\n\n  return func(...Object.values(templateVars));\n}\n```\n\n{% alertbox warning %}\n    Don't use this approach on user inputs as expressions, to avoid XSS!\n{% endalertbox %}\n\n## Let's see an example...\n\nGiven is a tiny web app with the following structure:\n\n```html index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Reusable ES6 template literals</title>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/src/style.css\">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <main id=\"main\"></main>\n    <script src=\"src/index.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n```js index.js\nimport { App } from \"./app.js\";\n\nconst app = new App();\n\napp.init();\n```\n\n```js app.js\nclass App {\n  init() {\n    //do something\n  }\n}\nexport { App };\n```\n\nWhat we want to do now, is to load some images into the `main` element, by using a more or less complex element structure:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"photo\">\n  <a href=\"<!-- Url to view the photo -->\"\n     style=\"background-image: url(<!-- Url of the photo file -->);\"></a>\n</div>\n```\n\nTo separate our templates from the main code, we create a template module, which contains the dynamic tag function from above and a `photo` template we want to use in our app\n\n```js template.js\nclass Templates {\n\n  //Template\n  photo(data) {\n    return this.fillTemplate(\n      `\n      <div class=\"photo\">\n        <a href=\"${data.url}/\"\n        style=\"background-image: url(${data.file});\"></a>\n      </div>\n      `,\n      data\n    );\n  }\n\n  //Dynamic Tag Function\n  fillTemplate(templateString, templateVars) {\n    var func = new Function(...Object.keys(templateVars),\n                           \"return `\" + templateString + \"`;\"\n    );\n    return func(...Object.values(templateVars));\n  }\n  \n}\nexport { Templates };\n```\n\nThe template retrieves a `data` object, with the values of the defined expressions, and calls the dynamic tag function on the literal template.\n\nThis we can use now in our app code:\n\n```js app.js\n//Import Template module\nimport { Templates } from \"./templates.js\";\n\nclass App {\n  init() {\n\n    //Initialize Templates\n    this._templates = new Templates();\n\n    //Insert photo into MAIN element\n    let main = document.getElementById(\"main\");\n    main.insertAdjacentHTML(\n      \"beforeend\",\n      this._templates.photo({\n        file: \"my-photo.jpg\",\n        url: \"https://link-to-my.photo.com\"\n      })\n    );\n\n  }\n}\nexport { App };\n```\n\nSee it live at [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/reusable-es6-template-literals-4iyor?file=/src/templates.js).\n\n---\n\n## More Info\n\n{% moreinfo '{ \"list\": [\n  [\n    \"Stackoverflow\", \"Can ES6 template literals be substituted at runtime (or reused)?\",\n    \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30003353/can-es6-template-literals-be-substituted-at-runtime-or-reused\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"Github/Adelphos\", \"ES6-Reuseable-Template\",\n    \"https://github.com/Adelphos/ES6-Reuseable-Template\"\n  ]\n]}' %}\n","tags":["ES6","Templating"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Discoveries #5","url":"/post/Discoveries-5/","content":"In this episode of the **Discoveries** (almost) everything is about images and the web.

And I mean [Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html) and not the new web/smartphone based software, which doesn't come even close to the desktop application yet.\n\nI use Lightroom for all purposes after I shot my images: editing, cataloguing, managing and ... publishing. On publishing Lightroom offers you two approaches: *Export* and *Publish*. While *Export* is mainly for creating JPG copies of edited RAW images, *Publish* goes one step further and gives you the ability to do \"something\" with your exported JPG's, for example upload them on Flickr, Instagram, 500px or to your own web server via FTP. Major difference to *Export* is, that *Publish* keeps your images in sync. Everytime you change the source images, the defined publish services recognizes and offer you to re-publish your image.\n\n![Lightroom Publish](Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/lr-re-publish.png)\n\nIn the past years I tried a lot of Lightroom plugins for publishing on several platforms, but it doesn't work out for long, because all these platforms change their API almost every year (or are stamped) and the sparely maintained 3rd party plugins break.\n\nMy workflow for quite some time is to publish my photos on the hard drive, in a folder, which is synced via Dropbox with the cloud. From there I distribute them further.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nImportant on this approach is, to have a coherent output folder structure in order find a particular image afterwards.\n\nI store my RAW images on an external hard drive in a structure like this:\n\n```txt\n<Drive:\\>\n  ->  Fotos\n      ->  <Year>\n          ->  <Year>-<Month> <Eventname>\n```\n\nFirst step after shooting is to copy all RAW files from the SD Card into a new subfolder of the current year. From there I import them into my Lightroom catalog.\n\nAfter sorting, rejecting, editing and flagging in Lightroom, I have to \"export\" the 4- and 5-star rated images into the cloud. There I have a slightly different structure, with a different root folder name and without the year:\n\n```txt\n<Dropbox>\n  ->  Photos\n      ->  <Year>-<Month> <Eventname>\n```\n\nWith the built-in \"Hard Drive\" publish service of Lightroom, it is feasible to \"export\" the images, but not in my wanted folder structure, because it is not possible to use the sources' folder name as output folder name by option. It has to be specified manually each time, which is not very comfortable.\n\n![Hard Disk Publish Service](Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/publish-hard-disk.png)\n\n## Plugin to the rescue\n\nJeffrey Friedl, who is in the Lightroom plugin business about a decade, offers two plugins, which can solve the problem easily:\n\n1. [Jeffrey’s \"**Folder Publisher**\" Lightroom Plugin](http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/folder-publisher)  \n  Exports to disk in a folder hierarchy that mimics the folder hierarchy in your Lightroom catalog\n\nThis one helps me not much, because my output folder would look like this:\n\n```txt\n<Dropbox>\n  ->  Photos\n      ->  Fotos\n          -> <Year>\n              ->  <Year>-<Month> <Eventname>\n```\n\n2. [Jeffrey’s \"**Collection Publisher**” Lightroom Plugin](http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/collection-publisher)  \nExports to local disk in a folder hierarchy that mimics the collection hierarchy you build within Lightroom\n\nBesides the commonality of defining a root folder, where the files are exported to, Jeffrey's plugin has much more options to improve the export.\n\n![Collection Publisher](Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/collection-publisher.png)\n\nAs the main feature, you can create collections within the plugin to define the export targets:\n\n![Create Collection](Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/collection-publisher-create.png)\n\nIn the options of these collections, you can set several templates (variables) to let the plugin name the export subfolder automatically:  \n\n![Collection Options](Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/collection-publisher-options.png)\n\nBy using [Smart Collections](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/help/photo-collections.html#work_with_smart_collections) you don't even need to drag & drop your images to publish to the publish collection. Lightroom will do this auto-magically.\n","tags":["Lightroom","Publishing","Plugin"],"categories":["Photo-Editing"]},{"title":"Discoveries #4","url":"/post/Discoveries-4/","content":"It is so amazing how many cool stuff developers around the world are producing these days.

To keep the delivered sources small, I used the bundler [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), to pack all JS plugins in a single file and another one for my custom JS code. I used the same procedure with the CSS files.\n\nThe SPA contained only a single HTML file in which all bundeled sources and needed HTML template blocks were included, in order to load most of the stuff while starting the app, when the users sees a GMail-like  loading screen.\n\nBut the whole thing had one disadvantage: Debugging for example in Chrome Dev Tool is not a joy, if the code is packed with [Gulp Concat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-concat) and [Gulp Uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-concat). It would be much more convenient, if the source loading can be done depending on the environment.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nFirst step was to replace the SCRIPT and LINK tags in die ``index.html`` with a dynamic loading approach using JavaScript.\n\n## Dynamic JS loading\n\nFor some custom code it was necessary to load the plugins previously, because of dependencies.\n\n```js\nfunction addScriptAsync(url) {\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\n    var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n    script.type = \"text/javascript\";\n    script.src = url;\n\n    script.addEventListener(\"load\", function() {\n      resolve(script);\n    }, false);\n\n    script.addEventListener(\"error\", function() {\n      reject(script);\n    }, false);\n\n    document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);\n  });\n}\n```\n\nBy returning a ``Promise``, the calling code is able to wait for a dependent source to load:\n\n```js\naddScriptAsync(\"Build/vendor.min.js\").then(function() {\n  addScriptAsync(\"Build/custom.min.js\");\n});\n```\n\n## Dynamic CSS loading\n\nLoading CSS is pretty straightforward and includes an ``id`` as parameter, in order to be able to access the style afterwards, for example when tehh user is chanhing the SPA's theme: \n\n```js\nfunction addStylesheet(url, id) {\n\n  var stylesheet = document.createElement('link');\n  stylesheet.rel = 'stylesheet';\n  stylesheet.type = 'text/css';\n  stylesheet.href = url;\n\n  if (id) { stylesheet.setAttribute(\"id\", id); }\n  document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(stylesheet);\n}\n```\n\n```js\naddStylesheet(\"Build/vendor.css\");\naddStylesheet(\"Build/custom.css\");\n```\n\n## Consider the environment\n\nNow everything was set up to implement a switch, depending on whether the SPA was started locally or in production.\n\n```js\nvar _DEV = (window.location.hostname.indexOf(\"localhost\") !== -1);\n\naddStylesheet(\"Build/vendor.css\");\nif (_DEV) {\n  addStylesheet(\"Libraries/styles.css\");\n  addStylesheet(\"Libraries/helpers.css\");\n  ...\n} else {\n  addStylesheet(\"Build/custom.css\");\n}\n\naddScriptAsync(\"Build/vendor.min.js\").then(function() {\n  if (_DEV) {\n    addScriptAsync(\"Libraries/prototypes.js\")\n      .then(function() { return addScriptAsync(\"Libraries/tools.js\"); })\n      .then(function() { return addScriptAsync(\"Libraries/app.js\"); })\n      ...\n  } else {\n    return addScriptAsync(\"Build/custom.min.js\");\n  }\n})\n\n```\n\n","tags":["SPA","Bundling"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Show related posts in Hexo","url":"/post/Show-related-posts-in-Hexo/","content":"It is always nice to point the readers of your blog's articles to related posts, they might be interested in.

Here is a way to implement the requirements...\n\nThe right place to store related posts is in the [Frontmatter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter.html) of your article. Create a list below the keyword ``related`` and take the slug (name of the post file) of the posts you want to show below the article as entries:\n\n```yaml\ntitle: My New fancy Post\nrelated:\n  - my-other-post\n  - one-of-my-first-posts\n  - yet-another-post\n```\n\nIn your ``article.ejs`` add a new partial called **related** to the place where it should be shown under the content of the actual article:\n\n```html\n<article \n  id=\"<%= post.layout %>-<%= post.slug %>\" \n  class=\"article article-type-<%= post.layout %>\" \n  itemscope itemprop=\"blogPost\">\n  \n  ...\n\n  <div class=\"article-inner\">\n    <%- post.content %>\n  </div>\n\n  <% if (!index){ %>\n\n    <!-- NEW RELATED PARTIAL -->\n    <%- partial('post/related') %>\n\n    <%- partial('post/comments') %>\n    <%- partial('post/nav') %>\n  <% } %>\n\n</article>\n```\n\nIn the folder ``themes/landscape/layout/_partial/post``, where all partials are stored which belongs to posts, create the new partial file:\n\n```html related.ejs\n<% if (post.related && post.related.length){ %>\n  <div class=\"article-related\">\n    <h2>Related</h2>\n    <div class=\"archives\">\n\n      <!-- Loop through the Frontmatter list of RELATED posts -->  \n      <% post.related.forEach(function(item) { %>\n\n        <!--Determine the post(s) with the given slug -->  \n        <%\n          var posts = site.posts.filter(function(post) {\n            return post.slug.toLowerCase() === item.toLowerCase();\n          });\n        %>\n\n        <!-- Loop through the post(s) and render the archive panel -->\n        <% posts.each(function(post) { %>\n          <%- partial('../archive-post', { post: post, show_link: true }) %>\n        <% }); %>\n\n      <% }); %>\n\n    </div>\n  </div>\n<% } %>\n```\n\n<small><em>(Remove the comments, because they doesn't belong to EJS)</em></small>\n\nIn this partial we loop through the Frontmatter list of related posts, determine the post by the given slug and render an archive panel for each post.\n\nThe list ``site.posts`` should always contain a slug just once, therefore getting an array of posts and looping is just a precuation.\n\nWhat you are getting you can see below...","tags":["Hexo","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Discoveries #3 - Tutorials","url":"/post/Discoveries-3-Tutorials/","content":"Some articles I stumble upon in my daily routine of reading news and blogs are diving very deep in a certain topic, especially if they are describing the basics of techniques I use every day.\n\nAll of the following reading tips are of the type \"ahh, that's why this works like that\" or \"uuh, I just scatch on the surface on that\".

Then ... do it with an input:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"<%= class_name %>\"\">\n    <input id=\"article-permalink\" value=\"<%- post.permalink %>\" />\n    <a id=\"action-copy\" class=\"article-action\" href=\"javascript:copyPermalink();\"></a>\n</div>\n<script>\n  var copyText = document.querySelector(\"#article-permalink\");\n  \n  //Disable Input by default\n  copyText.disabled = true;\n\n  function copyPermalink() {\n    //Enable Input\n    copyText.disabled = false;\n\n    //Select permalink text\n    copyText.select();\n\n    //Copy to clipboard\n    document.execCommand(\"copy\");\n\n    //Remove selection again\n    copyText.blur();\n\n    //Disable Input again\n    copyText.disabled = true;\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nNice, but a user feedback, that the text has been copied to the clipboard, was advisable, because nothing is more annoying, when you click somewhere and nothing seems to happen. As I hate default browser confirmations and other distracting messaging methods, I wanted to use the input itself, by fading out the link text, replace it with a message and fade in the text again:\n\n![Copy Animation](Pimping-the-Permalink/copy-animation.gif)\n\nI extended my ``animation.styl`` (Hexo works with [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/)) with two keyframe animations ... one for fading in, one for fading out...\n\n```styl\n@keyframes fadeIn {\n  0% {\n    opacity:0;\n  }\n  100% {\n    opacity:1;\n  }\n}\n.fade-in-500\n  animation: fadeIn ease 0.5s;\n.fade-in-1000\n  animation: fadeIn ease 1s;\n\n@keyframes fadeOut {\n  0% {\n    opacity:1;\n  }\n  100% {\n    opacity:0;\n  }\n}\n.fade-out-500\n  animation: fadeOut ease 0.5s;\n.fade-out-1000\n  animation: fadeOut ease 1s;\n```\n\n... and wrote a setTimeout cascade to achive the effect:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"<%= class_name %>\"\">\n    <input id=\"article-permalink\" value=\"<%- post.permalink %>\" />\n    <a class=\"article-action action-copy\" href=\"javascript:copyPermalink();\"></a>\n</div>\n<script>\n  var copyText = document.querySelector(\"#article-permalink\");\n  copyText.disabled = true;\n  function copyPermalink() {\n      copyText.disabled = false;\n      copyText.select();\n      document.execCommand(\"copy\");\n      copyText.blur();\n      copyText.disabled = true;\n\n    //Store original text\n    var permalink = copyText.value;\n\n    //Start fading out\n    copyText.classList.add(\"fade-out-500\");\n\n    //Wait until animation is done\n    setTimeout(function(){\n\n        //Set message, remove fadout class and add start fading in\n        copyText.value = \"copied to clipboard\";\n        copyText.classList.remove(\"fade-out-500\");\n        copyText.classList.add(\"fade-in-1000\");\n\n        //Wait 2 seconds to show the message\n        setTimeout(function() {\n\n            //Start to fade out message\n            copyText.classList.add(\"fade-out-500\");\n\n            //Wait until animation is done\n            setTimeout(function() {\n\n                //Set original text again and remove fadout class\n                copyText.value = permalink;\n                copyText.classList.remove(\"fade-out-500\");\n\n                //Wait until animation is done\n                setTimeout(function() {\n\n                    //Remove fadeout class\n                    copyText.classList.remove(\"fade-in-1000\");\n                }, 500);\n            }, 500);\n        }, 2000);\n    }, 500);\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\n## Share\n\nThe second permalink feature was a little bit trickier, because I didn't want to use one of the sharing libraries out there, whose business model is based on my readers data (always keep conservative on implementing third party stuff, because you never know what they are doing with the data). But a couple of months ago I read about a new native browser API for WebApps on the rise: **Web Share API**.\n\nSince 2019 [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) is working on this API, *for sharing text, links and other content to an arbitrary destination of the user's choice*. On 27 August 2020 the published a [Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-share/) and on 16 September 2020 the latest [Editors Draft](https://w3c.github.io/web-share/).\n\n![Can I Use - Web Share, state today](Pimping-the-Permalink/caniuse-web-share.png)\n\nBrand new stuff. The browser support is not the best yet, but it will be getting better in the near feature, especially as Edge Chrome is one of the early adopters.\n\n![Web Share in Edge Chrome](Pimping-the-Permalink/web-share-edge-chrome.png)\n\n[web.dev](https://web.dev/web-share/) lists important requirements on using this new feature in JavaScript:\n\n* It can only be used on a site that supports HTTPS\n* It must be invoked in response to a user action such as a click\n\nBut it can share URL's, text and even files! \n\nA raw implementation can be:\n\n```js\nif (navigator.share === undefined) {\n  navigator.share({\n    title: 'My Post',\n    url: 'https://my-domain.com/my-url',\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log('Successful share'))\n  .catch((error) => console.log('Error sharing', error));\n} else {\n  // fallback\n}\n```\n\nI refrain to implement a fallback, rather I would like to show the appropriate button only to those users, whose browser supports it:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"<%= class_name %>\"\">\n    <input id=\"article-permalink\" value=\"<%- post.permalink %>\" data-id=\"<%= post._id %>\" />\n    <a id=\"action-copy\" class=\"article-action\" href=\"javascript:copyPermalink();\"></a>\n    <a id=\"action-share\" class=\"article-action\" href=\"javascript:sharePermalink();\"></a>\n</div>\n<script>\n    function copyPermalink() {\n      -- SEE ABOVE\n    }\n\n    if (navigator.share === undefined) {\n        var shareLink = document.querySelector(\"#action-share\");\n        shareLink.style.display = \"none\";\n    }\n\n    function sharePermalink() {\n        navigator.share({\n            title: \"<%- post.title %>\",\n            url: \"<%- post.permalink %>\",\n        })\n    }\n</script>\n```\n\n## More Info\n\n{% moreinfo '{ \"list\": [\n  [\n  \"w3c.github.io\", \"W3C Web Share Test\",\n  \"https://w3c.github.io/web-share/demos/share-files.html\"\n  ],\n  [\n  \"heise Developer\", \"Features von übermorgen: Die Web Share API und die Web Share Target API (German)\",\n  \"https://www.heise.de/developer/artikel/Features-von-uebermorgen-Die-Web-Share-API-und-die-Web-Share-Target-API-3506197.html\"\n  ],\n  [\n  \"CSS-Tricks\", \"How to Use the Web Share API\",\n  \"https://css-tricks.com/how-to-use-the-web-share-api/\"\n  ]\n]}' %}\n","tags":["Hexo","CSS","Stylus","Share"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Discoveries #2","url":"/post/Discoveries-2/","content":"New month, new discoveries.

As I am a big [Trello](https://trello.com) fan, I wanted to give it a chance to be Pockets successor on my smartphone, where I'm reading mostly.\n\nOn installing the Trello Android app, you will find a new SHARE target **Add new Trello card**, which is comfortable to use:\n\n(Sry, for the German screenshots ;)\n\n![Android's default share with New Trello Card](android-share-website.png)\n\nThe result, website's title and Url set, is nice at best:\n\n![Trello card via Android Share](card-via-share.png)\n\n... but Trello has a **[Bookmarklet](https://trello.com/add-card)**, which does the job much better.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n{% alertbox info %}\nThe following approach works best in the Google Chrome browser.\n{% endalertbox %}\n\nFirst, a Bookmarklet is a small piece of JavaScript, which is stored as a bookmark in your browser. As you can't actually create such a Bookmarklet in your Android Chrome, you have to create it in your desktop Chrome and switch on the bookmark sync of chrome. You should right away choose a short, concise name for the bookmark, so you find it easier in Android Chrome afterwards. I called it **2TrelloCard**, because few websites start with an number.\n\nAfter Chrome's sync is done, go to any website do you want to store as a Trello card. Now enter the Url box and type the name of the bookmarklet and select it.\n\nInstead of requesting a different page, Chrome executes the JavaScript of the Bookmarklet against the currently open website. This script shows a Trello dialog, where you can choose, which board and list the new card should be created on.\n\n![Open Bookmarklet on Website in Android Chrome](open-bookmarklet.gif)\n\nThis card creation method not only sets the title of the card, but fills the description with the [meta description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element) of the page, adds the first found meta image as cover and adds the Url as an attachment:\n\n![Trello card via Bookmarklet](card-via-bookmarklet.png)\n","tags":["Browser","Trello"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Horizontal navigation menu above an image","url":"/post/Horizontal-navigation-menu-above-an-image/","content":"\nI changed the main menu of my blog, because I wanted to get rid of the hamburger menu on the upper left, which was shown only for smartphones, but was not really reachable conveniently. Beside that it made no sense to have different navigations for different devices.\n\nMy choice was to implement a horizontal scrolling menu, which can grow over the time, without any need of customizing. As I have quite big header images and I wanted to place the new navigation in a more accessible zone, I decided to place it at the bottom, but above the header image.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nProblem was, not to cover a big part of the image with a full-colored or even semitransparent bar, by using a RGBA background color. I wanted it more translucent, but with enough contrast on bright images for the menu items to read.\n\nThe recently introduced W3C feature ``backdrop-filter`` was just the right thing for that. It is [supported by most modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-backdrop-filter), but it has to have a backup strategy for the rest of the bunch.\n\nThe HTML is simple: \n\n```html\n<nav id=\"header-nav\" role=\"navigation\">\n  <ul class=\"menu\">        \n  \n    <li class=\"menu-item\">\n      <a href=\"/first\" title=\"First\">\n        <span>First Item</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n            \n    <li class=\"menu-item\">\n      <a href=\"/second\" title=\"Second\">\n        <span>Second Item</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n    \n  </ul>\n</nav>\n```\n\nAnd here's the [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/docs) code for my approach:\n\n```styl\n#header-nav\n  position: absolute\n  bottom: 0\n  width: 100%\n  height: auto\n  box-sizing: content-box\n  overflow-x: scroll\n  overflow-y: hidden\n  \n  // BACKDROP-FILTER\n  backdrop-filter: blur(5px) brightness(90%)\n  @supports not (backdrop-filter: none)\n    background: rgba(0,0,0,0.25)\n  \n  // SCROLLBAR\n  &::-webkit-scrollbar\n    display: none\n  @supports not (webkit-scrollbar)  \n    scrollbar-width: none\n  \n  .menu\n    display: flex\n    list-style: none\n    margin: 0\n    padding: 0\n    \n    .menu-item\n      flex-basis: 80px \n      flex-shrink: 0\n      flex-grow: 1\n      max-width: 100px\n      margin: 0 2px\n      text-overflow: ellipsis;\n      \n      a\n        display: inline-block\n        width: 100%\n        padding: 10px 0\n        color: #ffffff\n        font-weight: bold\n        text-decoration: none\n        text-align: center        \n```\n\nThe navigation box is ``absolute`` positioned on the image, is as wide as the screen and scrolls exclusively horizontal. The items are a unordered list, with default width and arranged by ``flex``.\n\nIn case a browser doesn't understand ``backdrop-filter``, the navigation bar is shown with a classic alpha channel opacity.\n\nWhen having a horizontal scroll feature, the scrollbar shown by the browser is beyond beautiful. To prevent this, I used the CSS pseudo element ``::-webkit-scrollbar``, which is supported by WebKit and Blink bowsers, with a fallback for all other browsers. Both strategies allows to be still able to scroll. If you want to have a scrollbar, but not the built-in, I can only recommend to read something about styling scrollbars, like [here](https://css-tricks.com/custom-scrollbars-in-webkit/) and [here](https://css-tricks.com/the-current-state-of-styling-scrollbars/).","tags":["CSS","Stylus"],"categories":["UI/UX"]},{"title":"Change CSS class when element scrolls into viewport","url":"/post/Change-CSS-class-when-element-scrolls-into-viewport/","content":"I had a neat visual gimmick on the start page of this blog, that the gray-scaled header image of a post in the list scaled up to 100% and became colored, when the user hovered over it:\n\n```css\n.article-inner .article-photo {\n  height: 150px;\n  width: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n  transform: scale(1);\n  transform-style: preserve-3d;\n  transition: all ease-out 0.6s;\n  opacity: 0.3;\n  filter: grayscale(1) contrast(0.5);\n}\n.article-inner:hover .article-photo {\n  transform: scale(1.1);\n  opacity: 1;\n  filter: grayscale(0) contrast(1);\n}\n```\n\nNice, but a little bit useless on smartphones or tablets, where HOVER  doesn't really work.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nA better idea was to transform the header image automatically, when it becomes visible to the user.

On entering the first comment, Utterances told me to install the needed GitHub App to my repo, in order to make it work ... and done.\n\n![Utterances GitHub App](Using-GitHub-as-Commenting-Platform/utteranc-github-app.png)\n\nThe result you see below ...\n\n## UPDATE...\n\nThe utterances script tag has the attribute ``theme``, to tell utterances  which style should be delivered. There are several themes available, but if users are able to switch between light or dark mode on the page (see [Hexo and the Dark Mode](/categories/Tools/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode)), the comment block should change to an suitable theme also.\n\nOn order to respond on a mode change, it is necessary to write a more dynamic script loading.\n\nFirst we define a function in a global script file to load the utterances script via JS:\n\n```js\nfunction insertUtterancesCommentBlock() {\n    var commentTheme = \"github-light\";\n    if(localStorage.getItem(\"theme\") === \"dark\"){\n      commentTheme = \"github-dark\";\n    }\n    const scriptId = \"comment-theme-script\";\n    const existingScript = document.getElementById(scriptId);\n    if (!existingScript) {\n      const commentScript = document.createElement(\"script\");\n      commentScript.id = scriptId;\n      commentScript.src = \"https://utteranc.es/client.js\";\n      commentScript.setAttribute(\"repo\", \"kristofzerbe/kiko.io\");\n      commentScript.setAttribute(\"issue-term\", \"pathname\");\n      commentScript.setAttribute(\"theme\", commentTheme);\n      commentScript.setAttribute(\"crossorigin\", \"anonymous\");\n      const placeholder = document.getElementById(\"comment-placeholder\");\n      placeholder.innerHTML = \"\";\n      placeholder.appendChild(commentScript);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen we change the placement in the EJS file, by defining a placeholder  and ensuring that the script above is loaded, before we call it:\n\n```ejs\n<div id=\"comment-placeholder\"></div>\n<script>\n  window.addEventListener('load', function () {\n    insertUtterancesCommentBlock();\n  })\n</script>\n```\n\nOn my blog, everytime the user switches between light/dark mode the ``body`` tag will be decorated with the data tag ``data-theme`` and the value of the mode. To keep the loading of the utterances script independent from this functionality, we just have to listen to this change via ``MutationObserver``:\n\n```js\n//observe theme change, to adjust comment block theme\nvar target = document.documentElement,\n    observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) {\n        mutations.forEach(function(mutation) {\n            if (mutation.attributionName === \"data-theme\" );\n                insertUtterancesCommentBlock();\n            });        \n    }),\n    config = { attributes: true };\nobserver.observe(target, config);\n```","tags":["Hexo","GitHub","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Meaningful automatic versioning with T4","url":"/post/Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/","content":"\nEvery developer has to have an idea of versioning his products. If you work with Visual Studio you have the ``Assembly Information`` in the project properties dialog, to enter it manually everytime you want to release a new version:\n\n![Assembly Information Dialog](Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/AssemblyInformationDialog.png)\n\nThe four fields are: MAJOR, MINOR, BUILD, REVISION.\n\nBut seriously ... who does that? I guess 99% of all C# developers are entering the ``AssemblyInfo.cs`` and enter the famous 2 asterisks into the version declaration of BUILD and REVISION, to let Visual Studio do the incrementation job:\n\n```c#\n[assembly: AssemblyVersion(\"1.0.*.*\")]\n[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion(\"1.0.*.*\")]\n```\n\nBut this is not the end of the possibilities ... Let's do it more meaningful, with some goodies and still automatic...\n<!-- more -->\n\n## More informative versioning\n\nA build with an increased MAJOR version number means, that there are significant changes in the product, even breaking changes. This always should be set manually.\n\nAlso the MINOR. It stands for significant functional extensions of the product.\n\nHow does Visual Studio calculate BUILD and REVISION?\n\n{% blockquote %}\nWhen specifying a version, you have to at least specify major. If you specify major and minor, you can specify an asterisk for build. This will cause **build** to be equal to the **number of days since January 1, 2000 local time**, and for **revision** to be equal to the **number of seconds since midnight local time, divided by 2**.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nBut, the BUILD number should explain, how often a software with a particular MAJOR.MINOR has been build, due to minor changes and bug fixes.\n\nThe \"Asterisk\" REVISION number is a little weird, but at least with the BUILD number unique. But it says nothing. Better to pick up the idea of a date calculated, unique number, but not an arbitrary date ... let's take the date the project has started.\n\nFor example: **1.2.16.158** ... reads version 1.2 with 16 builds on the 158'th day after the project has started.\n\n## Start with T4\n\nT4 (Text Template Transformation Toolkit) is a templating system in Visual Studio for generating text files during design time. It is very suitable to even generate code. Read about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/code-generation-and-t4-text-templates) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/writing-a-t4-text-template).\n\nA Text Template (.tt) has **Directives** (how the template is processed), **Text blocks** (text copied to the output) and **Control blocks** (program code).\n\nFor our versioning template, we start with this in a new file named **``AssemblyVersion.tt``**:\n\n*Directives*:\n\n```xml\n<#@ template hostspecific=\"true\" language=\"C#\" #>\n<#@ output extension=\".cs\" #>\n```\n\n*Control block*:\n\n```c#\n<#\n  int major = 1;\n  int minor = 0;\n  int build = 0;\n  int revision = 0;\n#>\n```\n\n*Text block*:\n\n```c#\n// This code was generated by a tool. Any changes made manually will be lost\n// the next time this code is regenerated.\n\nusing System.Reflection;\n\n[assembly: AssemblyVersion(\"<#= $\"{major}.{minor}.{build}.{revision}\" #>\")]\n[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion(\"<#= $\"{major}.{minor}.{build}.{revision}\" #>\")]\n```\n\nOn saving the TT file, a new CS file with the same name will be created automatically and you got an error like this:\n\n![Duplicate Attributes Error](Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/DuplicateAttributes.png)\n\n### A new place for version info\n\nTh error occurs, because we have now **two** ``AssemblyVersion`` and ``AssemblyFileVersion`` attributes in our project. We need to comment out the original in ``Properties\\AssemblyInfo.cs``:\n\n![Change AssemblyInfo.cs](Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/ChangeAssemblyInfo.png)\n\n### Structural Considerations\n\nIt makes sense to store all needed files for the new versioning system in a new root folder of the project, named **AssemblyVersion**, starting with the ``AssemblyVersion.tt``, because there will be more files later on.\n\n## New app information file\n\nAs we replaced the original version attributes in the project with those from our generated  ``AssemblyVersion.cs``, we cannot control the MAJOR and MINOR version number via the project property dialog any longer. We need a new approach on that, which can be edited easily and processed automatically.\n\n### AssemblyVersion.json\n\n```js\n{\n  \"initialDate\": \"2019-09-29\",\n  \"versions\": [\n    {\n      \"major\": 1,\n      \"minor\": 1,\n      \"releaseDate\": \"\",\n      \"remarks\": \"Some cool new features; New versioning system\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"major\": 1,\n      \"minor\": 0,\n      \"releaseDate\": \"2019-10-01\",\n      \"remarks\": \"Initial Release\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis new JSON file has two main items:\n* ``initialDate`` - the date the project has started, to calculate the REVISION later on\n* ``versions`` - a list with all different MAJOR/MINOR versions we have done so far, with at least one without a release date ... the one with the highest ``major`` and ``minor``.\n\nThe ``remarks`` attribute of a list item holds some information about the changes in a new version. Together with ``releaseDate``, useful for a possible release history, shown in the product itself.\n\n### Library references in T4\n\nT4 runs in its own app domain, therefore it can use built-in libraries as ``System.IO``, but not third-party libraries like ``Newtonsoft.JSON``. \n\nWe could reference those libraries from the projects package folder via the absolute path (if we use it in our product), but when we are running a NuGet update, the reference will break. \n\nIt is advisable to store such libraries directly in a fixed folder, like **AssemblyVersion\\Libraries**. They won't have any impact to our product, because the are only used while design time.\n\n## The MAJOR and MINOR\n\nTo process the new ``AssemblyVersion.json`` in the template, we need some new directives for referencing the needed libraries and the import of the appropriate namepaces:\n\n```xml\n<#@ assembly name=\"System.Core\" #>\n<#@ assembly name=\"$(SolutionDir)\\AssemblyVersion\\Libraries\\Newtonsoft.Json.dll\" #>\n\n<#@ import namespace=\"System.IO\" #>\n<#@ import namespace=\"System.Linq\" #>\n<#@ import namespace=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" #>\n```\n\nVia the use of the T4 variable ``$(SolutionDir)``, we can point to our copy of Newtonsoft JSON.\n\nNow we can read and convert the JSON into an anonymous object and get the highest values of MAJOR and MINOR:\n\n```c#\n<#\n    string avPath = this.Host.ResolvePath(\"AssemblyVersion.json\");\n    string avJson = File.ReadAllText(avPath);\n\n    var avDefinition = new {\n        initialDate = \"\",\n        versions = new [] {\n            new {\n                major = 0,\n                minor = 0,\n                releaseDate = \"\",\n                remarks = \"\" }\n        }\n    };\n    var avObject = JsonConvert.DeserializeAnonymousType(avJson, avDefinition);\n\n    //Get highest Major/Minor from versions list\n    var maxVersion = avObject.versions\n      .OrderByDescending(i => i.major)\n      .ThenByDescending(j => j.minor)\n      .First();\n\n    //Set MAJOR\n    int major = maxVersion.major;\n\n    //Set MINOR\n    int minor = maxVersion.minor;\n#>\n```\n\n## The BuildLog\n\nIn order to get the version number for BUILD, we need a method to count and store every build that has been run, separated by the MAJOR/MINOR versions. This is a job for a **Post-build event**, which can be configured in the project properties dialog. The event uses shell commands as they are used on the command line.\n\nWhat the commands should do:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write a new line with the current date and time in a log file, named after the MAJOR/MINOR version and stored in the folder **AssemblyVersion\\BuildLogs**.\n\n![Build Log](Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/BuildLog.png)\n\n### Extending build event macros\n\nShell commands for build events are supporting built-in variables, so called 'macros', like ``$(ProjectDir)`` (which returns the project directory path), but there is no such macro for the current version number. We have to introduce it via extending the project with a new build target.\n\nUnload the project in Visual Studio for editing the CSPROJ (or VBPROJ) file of your product manually and write the following definition just before the end-tag:\n\n```xml\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <PostBuildEventDependsOn>\n      $(PostBuildEventDependsOn);\n      PostBuildMacros;\n    </PostBuildEventDependsOn>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <Target Name=\"PostBuildMacros\">\n    <GetAssemblyIdentity AssemblyFiles=\"$(TargetPath)\">\n      <Output TaskParameter=\"Assemblies\" ItemName=\"Targets\" />\n    </GetAssemblyIdentity>\n    <ItemGroup>\n      <VersionNumber Include=\"@(Targets->'%(Version)')\" />\n    </ItemGroup>\n  </Target>\n```\n\nAfter reloading the project in Visual Studio, we can use ``@(VersionNumber)`` in our commands.\n\n### CreateBuildLog.bat\n\nThe event build editor is not very comfortable, so we create the batch file ``CreateBuildLog.bat`` in our **AssemblyVersion** folder and use this as the post build event command.\n\n{% alertbox exclamation %}\nThe BuildLog folder must exist, before running the following command the first time!\n{% endalertbox %}\n\n```bat\n@echo off\n\nREM --Get parameters\nset PROJECT_DIR=%1\nset VERSION_NUMBER=%2\n\nREM --Set what to log\nset LOG_LINE=%DATE% %TIME%\n\nREM --Inform the user\nset MSG=CreateBuildLog '%LOG_LINE%' for version %VERSION_NUMBER%\necho %MSG%\n\nREM --Get version parts\nFOR /f \"tokens=1,2,3,4 delims=.\" %%a IN (\"%VERSION_NUMBER%\") do (\n\tset MAJOR=%%a\n\tset MINOR=%%b\n\tset BUILD=%%c\n\tset REVISION=%%d\n)\n\nREM --Define BuildLog file and folder \nset BUILDLOG_FILE=%MAJOR%.%MINOR%.log\nset BUILDLOG_FOLDER=%PROJECT_DIR%\\AssemblyVersion\\BuildLogs\n\nREM --Write current date and time as new line in the file\necho %LOG_LINE% >> %BUILDLOG_FOLDER%\\%BUILDLOG_FILE%\"\n```\n\n![Post Build Event](Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/PostBuildEvent.png)\n\n```bat\n\"$(ProjectDir)\\AssemblyVersion\\CreateBuildLog.bat\" \"$(ProjectDir)\" @(VersionNumber)\n```\n\n## The BUILD\n\nAs we have now the BuildLogs, we can use them in the template:\n\n```c#\n<#\n    ...\n\n    //Get BuildLog of max version\n    string buildlogFolder = this.Host.ResolvePath(\"BuildLogs\");\n    string buildLog = \n      buildlogFolder + \"\\\\\" +\n      maxVersion.major + \".\" +\n      maxVersion.minor + \".log\";\n\n    //Get number of lines from BuildLog or create a new log (!)\n    var buildCount = 1;\n    if (File.Exists(buildLog)) {\n        buildCount = File.ReadLines(buildLog).Count() + 1;\n    } else {\n        File.Create(buildLog).Dispose();\n    }\n\n    //Set BUILD\n    int build = buildCount;\n#>\n```\n\nVery important is to create the log file, if it doesn't exists! Otherwise the build will always fail, because the version attributes can't be created.\n\n## The REVISION\n\nAt least we have to set the REVISION number, by calculating the difference between the current date and the ``initialDate``, which we have previously read from the ``AssemblyVersion.json``:\n\n```c#\n<#\n    ...\n\n    //Set REVISION\n    var dateCreated = DateTime.Parse(avObject.initialDate);\n    int revision = (DateTime.Now.Date - dateCreated.Date).Days;\n#>\n```\n\n## Transforming T4 template on build\n\nThe last hurdle is to run the text transformation every time you build your product. Until now it runs only on saving the ``AssemblyVersion.tt``.\n\nA great helper on that was Thomas Levesque's post [\"Transform T4 templates as part of the build, and pass variables from the project\"](https://thomaslevesque.com/2017/11/13/transform-t4-templates-as-part-of-the-build-and-pass-variables-from-the-project/), where he describes every difficulty to reach this goal.\n\nTo make it short: We have to edit the CSPROJ file again, to introduce TextTemplating to MSBuild.\n\nFirst we need following near the beginning of the projects XML:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n    <VisualStudioVersion Condition=\"'$(VisualStudioVersion)' == ''\">\n      16.0\n    </VisualStudioVersion>\n    <VSToolsPath Condition=\"'$(VSToolsPath)' == ''\">\n      $(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v$(VisualStudioVersion)\n    </VSToolsPath>\n    <TransformOnBuild>true</TransformOnBuild>\n    <OverwriteReadOnlyOutputFiles>true</OverwriteReadOnlyOutputFiles>\n    <TransformOutOfDateOnly>false</TransformOutOfDateOnly>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\nSecondly add the IMPORT of the TextTemplating target AFTER the CSharp target:\n\n```xml\n<Import Project=\"$(MSBuildToolsPath)\\Microsoft.CSharp.targets\" />\n...\n<Import Project=\"$(VSToolsPath)\\TextTemplating\\Microsoft.TextTemplating.targets\" />\n```\n\nIf you build your product now, a new build log is created and the version numbers BUILD and REVISION are automatically increased.\n\n## See it in action\n\nThe project where I implemented this versioning first is [HexoCommander](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/HexoCommander). Feel free to download the code and see how the new versioning mechanism works.\n\n![Screencast Build HexoCommander](Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/screencast-build-hexocommander.gif)\n\nEnjoy versioning...","tags":["Visual Studio","Versioning","T4"],"categories":[".NET"]},{"title":"Automatic Header Images in Hexo","url":"/post/Automatic-Header-Images-in-Hexo/","content":"\nEvery article in this blog has an individual header image, to bring a little bit color into it. In this post I will show you how I deal with the images in using and automatic provisioning.\n\nFor serving these pictures I use a static folder, as described in [A New Blog: Customizing Hexo](/categories/Tools/A-New-Blog-Customizing-Hexo/). The hard work is done by the plugin [Hexo Generator Copy](https://github.com/niahoo/hexo-generator-copy), which copies the static files into the ``public_dir`` while generating.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Static File Structure\n\nIt is always advisable to provide one image for every device class, in order to save bandwidth and make the page loading as fast as possible:\n\n```txt\n| static/\n   | photos/\n      | mobile/\n         | my-lovely-picture.jpg\n         | ...\n      | tablet/\n         | my-lovely-picture.jpg\n         | ...\n      | normal/\n         | my-lovely-picture.jpg\n         | ...\n```\n\nThe ``mobile`` images are at least 480 pixels wide, the ``tablet`` variants 768 pixels and the standard or ``normal`` one 1280 pixels.\n\nWhile creating the JPG files, it is important to compress them with a tool like [JPEGMini](https://www.jpegmini.com/) to save data while loading.\n\n## Binding\n\nIn order to bind a picture with some additional information to an article, I have extended the Frontmatter of every post:\n\n```yaml\nphotograph:\n    file: 'my-lovely-image.jpg'\n    name: 'My Lovely Image'\n    link: 'https://500px.com/photo/123456789/My-Lovely-Image'\n```\n\n## Usage in Theme\n\nIt relies on your Hexo theme, how to use a header image. In my theme (derived from the standard theme) I just added following code in the ``article.js`` to show the individual header image as a background image at the top of the article: \n\n```html\n<% if (!index && post.photograph){ %>\n<style>\n  #banner {\n    background-size: cover;\n  }\n  @media screen and (max-width: 479px) {\n    #banner { background-image:\n      linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.75) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 75%),\n      url(\"/photos/mobile/<%= post.photograph.file %>\"); }\n  }\n  @media screen and (min-width: 480px) and (max-width: 767px) {\n    #banner { background-image: \n      linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.75) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 75%),\n      url(\"/photos/tablet/<%= post.photograph.file %>\"); }\n  }\n  @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {\n    #banner { background-image: \n      linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.75) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 75%),\n      url(\"/photos/normal/<%= post.photograph.file %>\"); }\n  }\n</style>\n<script>\n  var photoLink = document.getElementById(\"header-photo-link\");\n  photoLink.href = \"<%= post.photograph.link%>\";\n  photoLink.innerHTML = \"see <strong><%= post.photograph.name%></strong> at 500px\";\n</script>\n<% } %>\n```\n\nImportant part here is the use of the Frontmatter data ``post.photograph.file`` in the URL of the background CSS. The script fills the additional information into the absolute positioned element ``header-photo-link`` which is placed on top of the header.\n\n## Pooling Images\n\nAs it is time consuming to generate the necessary images, I have created another static folder ``pool`` to store prepared files and a text file with the additional information about the image. The structure of ``pool`` is different to ``photos``, because of my image workflow and some limitations of automating the provisioning.\n\n```txt\n| static/\n   | pool/\n      | my-lovely-picture/\n         | meta.txt\n         | mobile.jpg\n         | normal.jpg\n         | tablet.jpg\n      | ...\n```\nThe ``meta.txt`` is a simple text file with two lines of text: first the name of the image and second the Url to link to, which will be inserted in the appropriate Frontmatter fields on creating a new post:\n\n```txt\nMy Lovely Image\nhttps://500px.com/photo/123456789/My-Lovely-Image\n```\n\n## Automate binding and provisioning on new post\n\nDevelopers are lazy and I do not make an exception. Having all these pool images and the meta informations, it would be nice, if Hexo just picks and processes one of the pool folders automatically, when I'm creating a new post by calling ``hexo new \"My shiny new post\"`` ... and it was easier then I thought.\n\n### Where to place the code for the automatism\n\nHexo has a great [API](https://hexo.io/api/) to write [plugins](https://hexo.io/plugins/) and it is not very difficult to setup a new plugin for this, which can be published to the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=hexo). But it is also possible to extend Hexo's functionality by using a simple script. All you need is a **``script``** folder in the root of your Hexo project. Any JS files which is placed there, will be executed by Hexo.\n\nTherefore, lets use a script called ``\\scripts\\process-photo-on-new.js`` ...\n\n### Things an automatism should do - Step by Step\n\n1. Hook into the creation of a post\n2. Pick randomly one of the pool images\n3. Place the content of the meta.txt in the Frontmatter\n4. Move the 3 device-dependend images into the ``photos`` folder\n\n#### Step 1 - Hook into the creation of a post\n\nThe needed event, the automatism can hook on, is:\n\n```javascript\nhexo.on('new', function(data){\n  //\n});\n```\n\nIt will be executed every time you call the ``hexo new`` command. The parameter ``data`` is an object with two fields:\n\n* ``path``  \nFull path to the MD file of the new post\n\n* ``content``  \nComplete content of the scaffold (template), which Hexo has used to create the new post; default is ``/scaffolds/post.md``.\n\nBy preloading the Hexo Front matter library and parsing ``data.content`` we get access to the definition of the new post:\n\n```javascript\nconst front = require('hexo-front-matter');\n\nhexo.on('new', function(post){\n\n  // parse article content\n  var post = front.parse(data.content);\n});\n```\n\n#### Step 2 - Pick randomly one of the pool images\n\nThere are some build-in variables to get the full path, for example, of the ``source`` folder, we can use to define the needed paths to the ``pool`` and the ``photo`` folder.\n\n```javascript\nconst front = require('hexo-front-matter');\n\nhexo.on('new', function(post){\n  var post = front.parse(data.content);\n\n  // set the path variables\n  var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"pool\";\n  var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"photos\";\n});\n```\n\nNext, we need to preload the Hexo FS library for file access, to list the content of the ``poolDir``, including the subfolders, and filter out the meta files. Out of the resulting array we pick one randomly, to use for the new post:\n\n```javascript\nconst front = require('hexo-front-matter');\nconst fs = require('hexo-fs');\n\nhexo.on('new', function(post){\n  var post = front.parse(data.content);\n\n  var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"pool\";\n  var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"photos\";\n\n  // list all files\n  var files = fs.listDirSync(poolDir);\n\n  // filter the list to get meta files of each subfolder\n  var metaFiles = files.filter(file => file.match(/.*[\\\\]meta.txt/g));\n\n  // pick one randomly\n  var metaFile = metaFiles[Math.floor(Math.random() * metaFiles.length)];\n\n  // get the name of the picked photo (foldername)\n  var photoName = metaFile.split(\"\\\\\")[0];\n});\n```\n\n#### Step 3 - Place the content of the meta.txt in the Frontmatter\n\nNow we have to read the meta file, place the data in the Frontmatter and save the article file:\n\n```javascript\nconst front = require('hexo-front-matter');\nconst fs = require('hexo-fs');\n\nhexo.on('new', function(post){\n  var post = front.parse(data.content);\n\n  var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"pool\";\n  var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"photos\";\n  \n  var files = fs.listDirSync(poolDir);\n  var metaFiles = files.filter(file => file.match(/.*[\\\\]meta.txt/g));\n  var metaFile = metaFiles[Math.floor(Math.random() * metaFiles.length)];\n  var photoName = metaFile.split(\"\\\\\")[0];\n\n  // read meta file\n  var meta = fs.readFileSync(poolDir + \"\\\\\" + metaFile);\n  var metas = meta.split(\"\\n\");\n\n  // place file and additional info in the Frontmatter\n  post.photograph.file = photoName + \".jpg\";\n  post.photograph.name = metas[0];\n  post.photograph.link = metas[1];\n\n  // convert content back\n  postStr = front.stringify(post);\n  postStr = '---\\n' + postStr;\n\n  // store article\n  fs.writeFile(data.path, postStr, 'utf-8');\n});\n```\n\n#### Step 4 - Move the 3 device-dependend images into the photos folder\n\nLast but not least, we have to move the pool images into the ``photos`` folder and remove the pool folder with all its processed content:\n\n```javascript\nconst front = require('hexo-front-matter');\nconst fs = require('hexo-fs');\n\nhexo.on('new', function(post){\n  var post = front.parse(data.content);\n\n  var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"pool\";\n  var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"photos\";\n  \n  var files = fs.listDirSync(poolDir);\n  var metaFiles = files.filter(file => file.match(/.*[\\\\]meta.txt/g));\n  var metaFile = metaFiles[Math.floor(Math.random() * metaFiles.length)];\n  var photoName = metaFile.split(\"\\\\\")[0];\n\n  var meta = fs.readFileSync(poolDir + \"\\\\\" + metaFile);\n  var metas = meta.split(\"\\n\");\n\n  post.photograph.file = photoName + \".jpg\";\n  post.photograph.name = metas[0];\n  post.photograph.link = metas[1];\n\n  postStr = front.stringify(post);\n  postStr = '---\\n' + postStr;\n\n  fs.writeFile(data.path, postStr, 'utf-8');\n\n  //copy normal image\n  fs.copyFile(\n    poolDir + \"\\\\\" + photoName + \"\\\\normal.jpg\",\n    photosDir + \"\\\\normal\\\\\" + photoName + \".jpg\",\n    function() {\n\n      //copy tablet image\n      fs.copyFile(\n        poolDir + \"\\\\\" + photoName + \"\\\\tablet.jpg\",\n        photosDir + \"\\\\tablet\\\\\" + photoName + \".jpg\",\n        function() {\n\n          //copy mobile image\n          fs.copyFile(\n            poolDir + \"\\\\\" + photoName + \"\\\\mobile.jpg\",\n            photosDir + \"\\\\mobile\\\\\" + photoName + \".jpg\",\n            function() {\n\n              //remove processed pool folder\n              fs.rmdirSync(poolDir + \"\\\\\" + photoName);\n            });\n        });\n    });\n\n});\n```\n\nNow it so easy to write a new post, because almost everything is set and I can concentrate on the article. Also, it is a nice surprise to see, which photo the script has chosen. The only thing I have to do from time to time, is to refill the pool folder with new images.\n","tags":["Hexo","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Localization with resource files in JavaScript web apps","url":"/post/Localization-with-resource-files-in-JavaScript-web-apps/","content":"\nThere are plenty of editors out there to help you writing JavaScript web applications. As I'm working in my daily life with Visual Studio, it is a obvious choice for me.\n\nOne of the most time saving tools in VS is the plugin [ResXManager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomEnglert.ResXManager), which is an awesome assistant on managing the translations for a Desktop- or ASP.NET-App, which uses XML-based RESX files.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nMostly very localization is based on key/value pairs, defined in separate files for every language provided.\n\nImplementing several languages in pure JavaScript apps is a little more difficult, because it makes no sense to deal with big XML files in JS. All localization libraries in the market uses JSON for storing the translations and it is a little bit of work to find the right one for your requirements.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Localization in JavaScript\n\nFor a current project I use  [jquery-lang](https://github.com/Irrelon/jquery-lang-js), because it provides the switch of the apps UI language without reloading and it is easy to implement. Thanks Rob Evans for your work...\n\nThe definition of \"tokens\" in one JSON file for each language is quite easy:\n\n```js ../languages/en.json\n{\n    \"token\": {\n        \"my-test\": \"My Test in English\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```js ../languages/de.json\n{\n    \"token\": {\n        \"my-test\": \"Mein Test in Deutsch\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe usage also:\n```html\n<div lang=\"en\" data-lang-token=\"my-test\">\n```\n\n## Using RESX and convert to JSON on build\n\nHaving this, the most time consuming work is to enter the translations to the localization files. If you have hundreds of them, it is hard to keep the 2, 3 or more language files in sync. You need a helper...\n\nAnd here comes ResXManager to the rescue, if you work with VS ... but it needs a conversation from RESX to the JSON format jquery-lang uses and this a task, which can be done on building the JS app, by using a task runner like [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/).\n\nAs there was no Grunt plugin/task out there to fit my needs, I have created  **grunt-resource2json** ([GitHub](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/grunt-resource2json), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-resource2json)). The configuration in the **gruntfile.js** is like: \n\n```json gruntfile.js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n    resource2json: {\n      convert: {\n        options: {\n          format: \"jquery-lang\"\n        },\n        files: [\n          {\n            input: \"resources/Resource.resx\",\n            output: \"build/langpacks/en.json\"\n          },\n          {\n            input: \"resources/Resource.de-DE.resx\",\n            output: \"build/langpacks/de.json\"\n          },\n          {\n            input: \"resources/Resource.es-ES.resx\",\n            output: \"build/langpacks/es.json\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    });\n```\n\nIt takes one RESX file (input) and converts it to a JSON file (output) in an array of files.\n\nThe heavy work in the plugin is done by the library [xml2js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js), which transforms the complete XML of the RESX file into a JSON object in one call. All I had to do, was to write all DATA nodes in a loop into the jquery-lang given structure and save it as JSON.\n\nCurrently supported is the format for jquery-lang only, but it would be awesome, if you fork the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/grunt-resource2json) and send me a Pull Request with the implementation of your needed format.\n","tags":["GitHub","Visual Studio","Resource","Localization"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"TFS/DevOps: Delete Remote Workspace","url":"/post/TFS-DevOps-Delete-Remote-Workspace/","content":"\nIf you are working with freelance developers and Azure DevOps/TFS with TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control) in your company, maybe this will look familiar to you: You hire a new freelancer and you want to reuse the hardware, including the complete software setup, to bring him/her to work as fast and straightforward as possible. You set up a new Azure Devops account with all necessary permissions and you think you're done. No you are not...\n<!-- more -->\n\nEverytime a user connects to a Team Project on Azure DevOps via Visual Studio and gets the code, VS is creating a **remote workspace** on the server, with the **machine name** as default, therefor it is not enough to wipe the profile and any other legacies of the last user from the machine. You also have to remove the remote workspace. Otherwise you will get an error message like that, if you are using a unique file structure on the developers hard disc:\n\n```txt\nThe working folder c://xxx is already in use by the workspace yyy;zzz on computer yyy\n```\n\nThe variable xxx stands for the blocked folder, yyy for the workspace/machine name and zzz for the users id on Azure DevOps.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no visual management console on Azure DevOps to manage your server workspaces, but there is a command line tool called **[tf.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/use-team-foundation-version-control-commands?view=azure-devops)**.\n\nThe easiest way to get rid of the unused server workspace in 3 steps:\n\n## Step 1\n\nRun **Developer Command Prompt** with Administrator privileges from Visual Studio 2019 and login with your Azure DevOps credentials. If the Login dialog doesn't show up, force it by executing:\n\n```txt\ntf.exe workspace\n```\n\n## Step 2\n\nGet a list of all remote workspaces available in your DevOps Collection by running the command:\n\n```txt\ntf.exe workspaces /computer:* /owner:* /format:xml > c:\\temp\\workspaces.xml\n```\n\nYou can get a list of all your workspaces by running ``tf workspaces``, but the list only shows you the ``owner``, but not the necessary ``ownerid`` and ... it is nicer to have a file to search in.\n\n## Step 3\n\nFind the abandoned workspace in the list and note its ``name`` and  ``ownerid`` for running the command:\n\n```txt\ntf workspace /delete {WORKSPACE.name};{WORKSPACE.ownerid}\n```\n\nNow your new colleague can create his own workspace on the same machine.\n\n## Update\nIn case you want to switch your own DevOps account to another and use the same folder as before, you can certainly delete the local workspace, but this wont help, because you are still logged in at TeamExplorer and the folder knows to whom it belongs. Solution is easy:\n\n1. Quit Visual Studio\n2. Rename folder in ``***_OLD`` or something\n3. Create new folder with the same name\n4. Enter ``C:\\Users\\YOUR-NAME\\appdata\\Local\\Microsoft\\Team Foundation\\VS-VERSION\\Cache`` and emtpy the folder to let Visual Studio forget who you are\n5. Remove all your Remote Workspaces as described above\n6.

The only thing I needed was a toggle element and a little bit of JavaScript.\n\nOf course, I couldn't manipulate the [media query ``prefers-color-scheme``](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#descdef-media-prefers-color-scheme) itself, but introduce a different way by blog uses it. Instead of implementing the media query directly into my CSS (or Stylus) code, I used a root selector, which can be manipulated by JavaScript ... something like this:\n\n```css\nbody {\n    background-color: white;\n    color: black;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] body {\n    background-color: black;\n    color: white;\n  }\n}\n```\n<!-- more -->\n\nIn every Stylus file, where I used ``@media prefers-dark`` to achieve the automatic switch by the OS, I changed this line into ``/[data-theme=\"dark\"] &`` :\n\n```styl\n#mobile-nav-header\n  background-color: color-background\n  /[data-theme=\"dark\"] &\n    background-color: dark-color-background\n  img.avatar\n    ...\n    /[data-theme=\"dark\"] &\n      filter: brightness(85%)\n```\n\nSome explanations on the [Stylus syntax](http://stylus-lang.com/docs/selectors.html): ``/`` means the root of the DOM and ``&`` points to the parent selector. Therefore the example will be rendered into this:\n\n```css\n#mobile-nav-header {\n    background-color: #f1f1f1;\n}\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] #mobile-nav-header {\n    background-color: #111;\n}\n\n#mobile-nav-header img.avatar {\n...\n}\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] #mobile-nav-header img.avatar\n    filter: brightness(85%);\n}\n```\n\nOnly problem was: the \"Root + Parent\" Stylus selector doesn't work in the block variables in the ``_extend.styl``. So I had to copy all theme relevant styles directly to the elements, where such a block was used: ``@extend <block-name>``.\n\n## The Toggle Switch\n\nIn the ``footer.ejs`` I added a toggle checkbox, where I could bind my JavaScript...\n\n```html\n<div id=\"footer-theme\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"theme-switch\">\n    <label for=\"theme-switch\"></label>\n</div>\n```\n\n... and some CSS in the ``footer.styl``, to style it:\n\n```styl\ninput#theme-switch[type=checkbox] {\n  display:none;\n}\n\ninput#theme-switch[type=checkbox] + label\n  height: 16px\n  width: 16px\n  display: inline-block\n  padding: 12px\n  font-size: 22px\n  cursor: pointer\n  &:before\n    display: inline-block\n    font-size: inherit\n    text-rendering: auto\n    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased\n    font-family: fa-icon-solid\n    content: icon-moon\n\ninput#theme-switch[type=checkbox]:checked + label\n  &:before\n    content: icon-sun\n```\n\nThe ``icon`` variables are defined in the ``_variables.styl`` like this:\n\n```styl\nicon-moon = \"\\f186\"\nicon-sun = \"\\f185\"\n```\n\n## The JavaScript\n\nEverything was now prepared to implement the switching code in JavaScript, which should support a manual switch by clicking the toggle element as well as the automatic switch by the OS.\n\nI wrapped all necessary code into a seperate JS file and placed a reference in the ``after-footer.ejs``, which places it at the bottom of the HTML:\n\n```ejs\n<%- js('js/dark-mode-toggle.js') %>\n```\n\n```js\nfunction detectColorScheme() {\n    var theme = \"light\"; //default\n\n    // get last used theme from local cache\n    if(localStorage.getItem(\"theme\")){\n        if(localStorage.getItem(\"theme\") === \"dark\"){\n            theme = \"dark\";\n        }\n    } else if(!window.matchMedia) { \n        // matchMedia not supported  \n        return false;\n    } else if(window.matchMedia(\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\").matches) {\n        // OS has set Dark Mode\n        theme = \"dark\";\n    }\n\n    // set detected theme\n    if (theme === \"dark\") {\n        setThemeDark();\n    } else {\n        setThemeLight();\n    }\n}\n\nconst toggleTheme = document.querySelector('input#theme-switch[type=\"checkbox\"]');\n\nfunction setThemeDark() {\n    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');\n    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark');\n    toggleTheme.checked = true;\n}\nfunction setThemeLight() {\n    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light');\n    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light');\n    toggleTheme.checked = false;\n}\n\n// Listener for theme change by toggle\ntoggleTheme.addEventListener('change', function(e) {\n    if (e.target.checked) {\n        setThemeDark();\n    } else {\n        setThemeLight();\n    }\n}, false);\n\n// Listener for theme change by OS\nvar toggleOS = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');\ntoggleOS.addEventListener('change', function (e) {\n    if (e.matches) {\n        setThemeDark();\n    } else {\n        setThemeLight();\n    }\n});\n\n// call theme detection\ndetectColorScheme();\n```\n\nBy using the both ``addEventListener``'s, each switch will be recognized and this approach is capable to support even more themes, just by using different values in the ``data-theme`` attribute.\n","tags":["Hexo","CSS","Stylus","Dark Mode"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Hexo and the Dark Mode","url":"/post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode/","content":"\nDue to the fact, that nowadays everybody is talking about Dark Modes for Browsers and Operating Systems, in order to save battery or for easier reading (uhh, really?), I decided my blog should support that.\n\n![Switching Dark Mode in Windows 10](Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode/screen-recording-1.gif)\n<!-- more -->\n\nStarting point is the new media query ``prefers-color-scheme``, which is actually supported by all modern browsers.\n\n## Technique\n\nMy first read was Tom Brow's [Dark mode in a website with CSS](https://tombrow.com/dark-mode-website-css), where he shows how to use the media query. Simplified, this is it, assuming the light version is the default:\n\n```css\nbody {\n    background-color: white;\n    color: black;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  body {\n    background-color: black;\n    color: white;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Pimping CSS for automatic switching\n\nTo support the automatic browser/OS-based automatic switch in Hexo, where [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) is used, I had to change some template files. First the ``_variables.styl``:\n\n```styl\n// existing color variables\ncolor-background = #f1f1f1\ncolor-foreground = #111\ncolor-border = #ddd\n...\n\n// new dark color variables\ndark-color-background = #111\ndark-color-foreground = #eee\ndark-color-border = #000\n...\n\n// new media query variable\nprefers-dark = \"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\n```\n\nNext step was to change the ``_extend.styl``, where some Stylus variables are defining complete blocks to extend. Here I had to supplement all lines, where something mode-dependend was defined, by adding the new ``prefers-dark`` media query and beneath the new 'dark' equivalence of the style:\n\n```styl\n$base-style\n  hr\n    ...\n    border: 1px dashed color-border-article\n    @media prefers-dark\n      border: 1px dashed dark-color-border-article\n    ...\n\n$block\n  ...\n  background: color-block\n  box-shadow: 1px 2px 3px color-border\n  border: 1px solid color-border\n  @media prefers-dark\n    background: dark-color-block\n    box-shadow: 1px 2px 3px dark-color-border\n    border-color: dark-color-border\n\n...\n```\n\nThe same changes I had to do in every template ``styl`` file, where one of the colors or other mode dependent style was used. For example:\n\n```styl\n#mobile-nav-header\n  background-color: color-background\n  @media prefers-dark\n    background-color: dark-color-background\n  img.avatar\n    ...\n    @media prefers-dark\n      filter: brightness(85%)\n```\n\nThis will be rendered as:\n\n```css\n  #mobile-nav-header {\n    background-color: #f1f1f1;\n  }\n  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n      #mobile-nav-header {\n      background-color: #111;\n    }\n  }\n\n  #mobile-nav-header img.avatar {\n    ...\n  }\n  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n    filter: brightness(85%);\n  }\n```\n\nPlease note the use of ``filter:brightness()`` in the example. It is always advisable to darken the images too, because they can really pop out on dark backgrounds.\n","tags":["Hexo","CSS","Stylus","Dark Mode"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"A New Blog: Blogging and Synching en route","url":"/post/A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/","content":"\nI work with several devices, some Windows, some Android, and sometimes I have time to write on my articles at home (Notebook, Tablet), in my spare time in the office (Desktop, Laptop) or on my way to somewhere (Smartphone).

Chapeau Microsoft, well done.\n\nSome of the following VS Code plugins makes working with Hexo on GitHub pages a breeze:\n\n---\n\n[![vscode-hexo](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/icon-vscode-hexo.png)]((https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codeyu.vscode-hexo){.lefty})  \nAdds Hexo commands like ``init``, ``new``, ``generate``, ``server`` and ``clean`` to the VS Code command palette.\n\n---\n\n[![Markdown All in One](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/icon-markdown-all-in-one.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)  \nKeyboard shortcuts for basic formatting, automatic list editing, autocomlete for images,  table formatter and much more for an easier handling of Markdown.\n\n---\n\n[![markdownlint](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/icon-markdownlint.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)  \nMarkdown linting and style checking\n\n---\n\n[![Language Stylus](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/icon-stylus.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sysoev.language-stylus)  \nAdds syntax highlighting and code completion to Stylus files\n\n---\n\n[![GitLens](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/icon-gitlens.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sysoev.language-stylus)  \nComplete visual management of your repositories in VS Code\n\n---\n\n[![Git Graph](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/icon-gitgraph.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)  \nView a Git Graph of your repository with all changes and manage commits.\n\n---\n\nWith this editor and its helpers, I'm just two clicks away from publishing a new article or even a new version of the Hexo blog itself.\n\n## Writing on Android\n\nThere are a lot of Markdown editors available on Google Play, but one is outstanding: [iA Writer for Android](https://ia.net/writer/support/android). I can open my posts or drafts directly from Dropbox, without the need of any sychronization. Open, write, close, done.\n\n![iA Writer Android](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/ia-writer-1.png)\n\n## Publishing on Android\n\nThere are some Git related Android apps out there, but no solution was satisfying. Furthermore, I didn't really need Git here, because I didn't want to have all source files on my smartphone. I'm working directly on the Dropbox stored MD files via iA Writer. Finally and most important, Git won't be enough, because before publishing, I have to run ``hexo generate``! Therefore some sort of automatic transfer from Dropbox to GitHub is also out of the game.\n\nWhat I needed, was to tell a server at a certain point of time 'Hey, please publish for me', using the only connection I have: Dropbox.\n\n### Introducing a Demon\n\nI have a little media server, running on Windows, and he is synchronizing some folders with Dropbox. He could do the job! After I installed all necessary packages, like NodeJS, Hexo and Git, I included the project folder into the sync. \n\nNext step was to design a so called **Hexo Command File**, a simple TXT file, which holds commands in single lines, extended with execution times, when they were successfully running.\n\n```properties\npostdraft: A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route\npublish\nnewdraft: \"A New Blog: Blogging and Synching en route\" @ 2019-09-30 21:15\nregenerate @ 2019-09-29 16:40:01\npublish @ 2019-09-29 16:40:10\n```\n\nThese commands are predefined, because they bundle several real commands and I didn't want to deal with real commands, due to security reasons.\n\nThe unprocessed commands are standing at the top of the file (in execution order!) and parameters are separated from the command by a colon and delimited by commas.\n\n    <command>: [<param1>, ...] @ <execution time>\n\nNext step was to create a program to work as an executing demon, who monitors the Hexo Command File (synced by Dropbox) on my server and executes commands without execution dates.\n\nI decided to create a simple Console Application in C# and use the built-in [Windows Task Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler) for running it every 2 minutes. The application is called **HexoCommander** and is [available at GitHub](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/HexoCommander).\n\nIt expects the Hexo Command File to be named ``hexo-commands.txt``, located in the same folder, and provides the following commands:\n\n**newdraft: \"&lt;title&gt;\"** ... runs\n\n1. ``hexo new draft \"<title>\"``\n\nCreates a new draft.\n\n**postdraft: \"&lt;filename without extension&gt;\"** ... runs\n\n1. ``hexo publish \"<filename without extension>\"``\n\nMakes a post out of a draft.\n\n**regenerate** ... runs\n\n1. ``hexo clean``\n2. ``hexo generate``\n\nWipes all Hexo static pages and generates them new.\n\n**publish** ... runs\n\n1. ``hexo generate``\n2. ``git add \"source/*\" \"docs/*\"``\n3. ``git commit -m \"Remote publication via HexoCommander\"``\n4. ``git push origin master``\n\nGenerates Hexo static pages, stage changes on drafts, posts and static pages, commits the changes with a generic message and pushes them to the server.\n\n### Running the demon\n\nI would have never expected, that the trickiest part was to get HexoCommander running via Windows Task Scheduler. What a mess! I finally find the solution [here](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/SqlServer/en-US/29446adf-8304-4b9f-bbc4-95daf2941d53/program-runs-fine-but-task-scheduler-wont-run-it?forum=winserver2008appcompatabilityandcertification):\n\n1. Compile HexoCommander in a **x86** configuration\n\n2. Create a new task in Task Scheduler with\n   * **Trigger**\n     * Dialy\n     * Recur every 1 days\n     * Repeat task every 2 minutes for a duration of 1 day\n   * **Action**\n     * Program/Script: **%systemroot%\\Syswow64\\cmd.exe**\n     * Add Arguments: **/C \"C:\\MyPath\\HexoCommander.exe /workdir=C:\\MyPath\"**\n     * Start In: **%systemroot%\\Syswow64\\\\**\n\nBecause some executing commands in the chain are NOT 64-bit, I had to force Task Scheduler to run the 32-bit Command Shell in its own path (see 'Start In' and don't forget the closing backslash) and take the 32-bit compiled HexoCommander as argument after the parameter ```/C``` (forcing command to terminate), including its own argument for defining the real working directory. Mind bending, but works...\n","tags":["VS Code","Hexo","GitHub","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"A New Blog: Customizing Hexo","url":"/post/A-New-Blog-Customizing-Hexo/","content":"\nHexo is a great tool to get quick results (see [Part One of this series](/categories/Tools/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/)), when you decide to have a blog and its defaults are practical, but it's power lies in the possiblities of customization via plugins. On the [official plugin page](https://hexo.io/plugins/index.html), there are actually 302 plugins listed, but there are many more and no wish will be unsatisfied.\n\nI will show you which of these I found worth to work with...\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Relative Image Path\n\nThe build-in way to include images in your posts works fine, but it is a little aside the normal way to declare images in Markdown. The plugin [Hexo Asset Link] corrects that. After installing via ``npm install hexo-asset-link --save`` you can write this:\n\n    ![Test Image](hello-world/image-1.png)\n\nThe best is, that VS Code's Markdown can now show the image.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE**:  \nActually the plugin [destroys external links](https://github.com/liolok/hexo-asset-link/issues/3), so don't use it until this is fixed ... or go to **node_modules** &gt; **hexo-asset-link** &gt; **index.js** in your project and change in line 22 ``protocal`` to ``protocol``.\n\n**UPDATE from Update**:  \n[liolok](https://github.com/liolok), the author of the plugin has merged my pull request and published a new new version without the typo. It works now as expected.\n\n---\n\n## Hide Posts\n\nA new Hexo project comes with a sample post called ``Hello World``. This is fine to play around with, but you don't want to publish it. Here comes a Hexo plugin to the rescue called [Hexo Hide Posts](https://github.com/printempw/hexo-hide-posts). After installing, you just have to write ``hidden: true`` to the Front Matter of you post and it won't be shown on the blog, but it is still available by URL.\n\n## Static Files\n\nHexo has the concept of [Assets Folders](https://hexo.io/docs/asset-folders), but for static files, beside article based files, I find it more useful to have a STATIC folder and copy the contents on every build into the publish folder. A good helper for this approach is the plugin [Hexo Generator Copy](https://github.com/niahoo/hexo-generator-copy). Install it by running ``npm install hexo-generator-copy --save`` and add ``static_dir: static`` to your ``_config.yml`` and you are done.\n\n    ![Hexo Static Files](A-New-Blog-Customizing-Hexo/vscode-1.png)\n\n## Feed\n\nThe default Hexo layout has an Atom Feed icon in the upper right corner, but strangely no feed file is generated on build. You need to install the plugin [Hexo Feed Generator](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed) to fix this, by running ``npm install hexo-generator-feed --save`` and copy following section into the ``_config.yml``:\n\n```yaml\nfeed:\n    type: atom\n    path: atom.xml\n    limit: 20\n    hub:\n    content:\n    content_limit: 140\n    content_limit_delim: ' '\n    order_by: -date\n```\n\n## Manifest for PWA\n\nIn these modern times it's always a good idea, that your blog feels like an App. For this you need a manifest file (JSON) an several icons (PNG). You can generate these files very fast with the [Web App Manifest Generator](https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com) and store it in your static folder.\n\nTo bind this file into your blog, you can use the plugin [Hexo PWA](https://github.com/lavas-project/hexo-pwa). Run ``npm install --save hexo-pwa`` and copy following section to your ``_config.yml``, where you take the settings from your generated manifest file:\n\n```yaml\npwa:\n    manifest:\n        path: /manifest.json\n        body:\n        name: myblog.de\n        short_name: My Blog\n        icons:\n            - src: /images/icon-192x192.png\n            sizes: 192x192\n            type: image/png\n            - src: /images/icon-512x512.png\n            sizes: 512x512\n            type: image/png\n        start_url: /index.html\n        theme_color: '#025ab1'\n        background_color: '#dddddd'\n        display: standalone\n```\n\n## Sitemap File\n\nTo help [Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668) and others a bit to index your blog, it is advisable to provide a sitemap file. Here comes [Hexo Generator Sitemap](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap) to the rescue. Install it by running the command ``npm install hexo-generator-sitemap --save``. You can configure it via ``_config.yml``:\n\n```yaml\nsitemap:\n    path: sitemap.xml\n    template: ./sitemap-template.xml\n```\n\nThe plugin installation doesn't create the needed ``sitemap-template`` file, so be sure you grab a copy from the plugins repository: [https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap/blob/master/sitemap.xml](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap/blob/master/sitemap.xml)\n\n## Commenting\n\nHexo doesn't have a commenting system, but it's prepared to stick [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments under each article. Just create a new Disqus account for your blog and note the given short name. By adding following section to the ``_config.yml`` Hexo shows the commenting section:\n\n```yaml\ndisqus_enabled: true\ndisqus_shortname: my-blog\n```\n\n## Inifinite Scroll\n\nHexo shows as much articles at the start page as configured in ``_config.yml`` under ``index_generator.per_page``, but it's nicer to load more articles as you scroll by using the Hexo script [Inifinite Scroll](https://github.com/FrontendSophie/hexo-infinite-scroll). Install by adding following little script in **themes** & gt; **layout** &gt; **_partial** &gt; **after-footer.ejs**\n\n```html\n<script src=\"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/frontendsophie/hexo-infinite-scroll@2.0.0/dist/main.js\"></script> \n<script>\n    infiniteScroll({\n    showNum: 5,\n    style: 'line-scale',\n    color: '#025ab1'\n    })\n</script>\n```\n\n## Back To Top\n\nIts nice to support the reader on scolling by providing a Scroll-To-Top button. The easiest way to get this, is the script [Vanilla Back To Top](https://github.com/vfeskov/vanilla-back-to-top). Just add follwing to **themes** &gt;**layout** &gt; **_partial** &gt; **after-footer.ejs**:\n\n```html\n<script>addBackToTop({\n    diameter: 30,\n    backgroundColor: 'rgb(0, 90, 180)',\n    textColor: '#fff'\n})\n</script>\n<style>\n#back-to-top {\n    border-radius: 0;\n    opacity: 0.6;\n}\n#back-to-top:hover {\n    opacity: 1;\n}\n</style>\n```\n","tags":["VS Code","Hexo","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"A New Blog: VS Code, Hexo and GitHub Pages","url":"/post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","content":"\nA few days ago I puzzled over a technical problem regarding SQL Server, Active Directory and Visual Studio Database Projects. With tips, hints and snippets from several websites I got it running and the solution was absolutely memorable. For myself and for others. Nothing is harder than to know 'you did this before...', but not to remember how.\n\nBecause of this strong leaning towards oblivion, I started over 20 years ago my very first website **zerbit.de**, manually crafted with Classic ASP and a SQL Server database as backend, with an editor, tagging, categories and so on. It was really exciting to build this blog from scratch and writing articles for it, but it was so time consuming to expand the features of the website and keep it running, that some day I quit it silently.\n\nSo, to document the solution mentioned above, I could use tools like OneNote or others, like in the past years, but this would be just for me and not for all developers, who have a similar problem. I felt it would be unfair to participate from the knowledge of others to get my solution and dont give something back.\n\nI decided to write an article just in HTML and publish it on my personal GitHub Page that I didn't used so far. Ok, just Text ... ugly. Just a little CSS and a little more structure and maybe I should do something with Vue JS ... STOP ... It would be better to pick one of the cool new static website generators based on Node.js, to detain myself from inventing the wheel again and save my time to write articles. So I did a little research and found [HEXO](https://hexo.io) ... Bingo! I can work with my favorite editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), its all HTML, JavaScript and CSS, I can write my articles in Markdown and Hexo has a lot of helpers for stuff Markdown doesn't provide, it produces static files and works only with files, therefore no need for a database ... and it is well documented.\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Installation\n\n.. is quite easy, as described here: [https://hexo.io/docs/setup](https://hexo.io/docs/setup)\n\n1. Create folder and open in VS Code\n2. Open VS Code Terminal window\n3. Install Hexo with ``$ npm install -g hexo-cli``\n4. Init Hexo project with ``$ hexo init``\n5. Install dependencies with ``npm install``\n6. Done\n\n![New Hexo Project](A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/vscode-1.png)\n\n## Writing\n\n### Create new post/draft\n\nHexo has posts and drafts, whereat drafts has to published via a Hexo command to become a post. To create an article use the command ``hexo new post|draft \"My Title\"``. The title will be converted in a URL-encoded string and will be used as file name and url.\n\n### Meta data\nEvery post/draft starts with its header (so called [Front Matter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter)) to store some meta data, which describes the post, like ``title``, ``date``, ``tags`` or ``categories``. This is used by Hexo to classify and arrange your post during the build.\n\n### Markdown\nHexo posts/drafts are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Good syntax reference are the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and the more detailed [Markdown Syntax Guide](https://sourceforge.net/p/hexo/wiki/markdown_syntax/).\n\n### Excerpt\nIs is usual to show a short excerpt an the start page of a blog, to keep it compact and teasering the user to click on a READ MORE button. To achieve this, you just have to add following comment to your article. Everything above is the excerpt and everything below is only shown, when you enter the article:\n\n    <!-- more -->\n\n### Images\n\nSome articles will contain images to illustrate something and the question is, where should they be stored? Answer: In a folder beside the post/draft, which has the same name as the article MD file. To get this, you have to activate the setting ``post_asset_folder`` in your ``_config.yml``. Now this folder will be created automatically, when you add a new post/draft.\n\nIn your Markdown you reference your image with:\n\n    {% asset_img image-1.png \"Test Image\" %}\n\n![Reference Image](A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/vscode-2.png)\n\n## Build\n\nHexo is a website generator, so a build will generate the whole website in a special folder, which has to be published. This output folder can be configured in the ``_config.yml``:\n\n    public_dir: public\n\nTo wipe the output folder, run the command:\n\n    hexo clean\n\nTo start the build, run:\n\n    hexo generate\n\nTo view the website via the build-in local Hexo server, run:\n\n    hexo server\n\n## Publishing\n\nMost \"complex\" task was to publish the new blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). My first approach was to use my personal page, as I did with my single HTML file, but this didn't work, because I wanted to store the whole project on GitHub and it is not possible to point a personal page to the subdirectory **docs** or use a different branch as **master**.\n\nThe simple solution was to create a new repository, named after my my blog **kiko.io**, to store teh whole project and point the GitHub Page to the subdirectory **docs** in the settings of the repository.\n\n![GitHub Settings](A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/github-1.png)\n\nBy overriding the default publish folder of Hexo in ``_config.yml`` ...\n\n    public_dir: docs\n\n... everything was set up. Commit and Push via git and done.\n\nHexo has its own deploying mechanism and it is advisable to disable it, by commenting out the Deployment section ``_config.yml``.\n\nNext step was to use my own custom domain for the blog. To achieve this, the most easiest way is to create a text file named ``CNAME`` (without extension!) with the content of the domain in a single line and publish this file in the root of the docs folder.

Then you have to split the fetch in several requests, because SQL Server quits with an error, when trying to read more than 900 records via ADSI.  \n\nBest option is, to filter the ADSI statement by something like *'get all user starting with a to j'*, when you are sure, that in this case less than 900 records will be given back and repeat the statement several times and glue the data together via a ``UNION`` statement:\n\n<pre>\n<code>SELECT  \n    UserPrincipalName,  \n    DisplayName,  \n    sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName],  \n    sn AS [LastName],  \n    givenName AS [FirstName],  \n    title AS [Title],  \n    Mail as [MailAddress],  \n    department AS [Department],  \n    l AS [Location],  \n    postalCode AS [PostCode],  \n    streetAddress AS [Street],  \n    st AS [State]  \nFROM (  \n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '  \n        SELECT  \n            UserPrincipalName,  \n            DisplayName,  \n            sAMAccountName,  \n            sn,  \n            givenName,  \n            department,  \n            title,  \n            Mail,  \n            l,  \n            postalCode,  \n            streetAddress,  \n            st  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*''  \n        AND givenName = ''*''  \n        <strong>AND sAMAccountName &lt;= ''j''</strong>\n    ')  \n\n    <strong>UNION ALL</strong>  \n\n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '  \n        SELECT <em>[...same as above]</em>  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*''  \n        AND givenName = ''*''  \n        <strong>AND sAMAccountName &gt; ''j''</strong>  \n        <strong>AND sAMAccountName &lt; ''p''</strong>  \n    ')\n\n    <strong>UNION ALL</strong>  \n\n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI,  '  \n        SELECT <em>[...same as above]</em>  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*''  \n        <strong>AND sAMAccountName &gt;= ''p''</strong>  \n    ')  \n) AD</code>\n</pre>\n\nWhen you store this as a VIEW, you can join it wherever you want on SQL Server:\n\n<pre>\n<code>CREATE VIEW [dbo].[vADUsers]\nAS\n    <em>[...SQL code from above]</em>\n\nGO</code>\n</pre>\n\n## Step 3 - SQL Server Database Project\n\nIf you work with a SQL Server Database Project, to have the complete structure of your database available in a version control system, you will get some reference errors on compiling and publishing your newly added SQL View ``vADUsers`` and on some objects, which rely on this View, because of following problems:\n\n1. Project doesn't know the Linked Server `ADSI`\n2. The structure (fields) of the data source is unknown\n\n### Declare the Linked Server\n\nTo show the Project that there is a Linked Server called ``ADSI``, just add following lines at the start of your view:\n\n<pre>\n<code><strong>sp_addlinkedserver 'ADSI'</strong>\n<strong>GO</strong>\n\nCREATE VIEW [dbo].[vADUsers]\nAS\n    <em>[...SQL code from above]</em></code>\n</pre>\n\nThis mimics the adding of a Linked Server, but will be ignored by SQL Server on publish, because you already have a Linked Server with this name. The project is happy with it.\n\n### Declare the data structure\n\nWhen you use the SQL-View ``vADUsers`` in a Stored Procedure for example, this object won't compile, because the project knows nothing about the fields of the ADSI data source. The SELECT in the view is not enough. You have to add an empty ``SELECT`` to the View ``vADUsers``, just for the declaration of the fields and without returning any records and join this via ``UNION`` with the other statements:\n\n<pre>\n<code>sp_addlinkedserver 'ADSI'\nGO\n\nCREATE VIEW [dbo].[vtADAllUsers]\nAS\n\nSELECT\n    UserPrincipalName,\n    DisplayName,\n    sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName],\n    sn AS [LastName],\n    givenName AS [FirstName],\n    title AS [Title],\n    Mail as [MailAddress],\n    department AS [Department],\n    l AS [Location],\n    postalCode AS [PostCode],\n    streetAddress AS [Street],\n    st AS [State]\nFROM (\n\n    -- Fake SELECT to declare the structure of the view<strong>\n    SELECT TOP 0\n        '' UserPrincipalName,\n        '' DisplayName,\n        '' sAMAccountName,\n        '' sn,\n        '' givenName,\n        '' department,\n        '' title,\n        '' Mail,\n        '' l,\n        '' postalCode,\n        '' streetAddress,\n        '' st\n\n    UNION ALL</strong>\n\n    SELECT *\n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '\n        SELECT\n            UserPrincipalName,\n            DisplayName,\n            sAMAccountName,\n            sn,\n            givenName,\n            department,\n            title,\n            Mail,\n            l,\n            postalCode,\n            streetAddress,\n            st\n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''\n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''\n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''\n        AND sn=''*''\n        AND givenName = ''*''\n        AND sAMAccountName &gt;= ''j''  \n    ')\n\n    UNION ALL  \n\n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '  \n        SELECT <em>[...same as above]</em>  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*''  \n        AND givenName = ''*''  \n        AND sAMAccountName &lt; ''j''  \n        AND sAMAccountName &gt; ''p''  \n    ')\n\n    UNION ALL  \n\n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI,  '  \n        SELECT <em>[...same as above]</em>  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*''  \n        AND givenName = ''*''  \n        AND sAMAccountName &lt;= ''p''  \n    ')\n) AD</code>\n</pre>\n\nNow, you can fetch data from Active Directory and store the code in a Database Project properly.\n\nHAPPY CODING :)\n","tags":["ADSI","Visual Studio","Database Project"],"categories":["SQL"]},{"url":"/index.html","content":"\nTODO: Extract text from index.ejs\n\n---\n"},{"title":"404","url":"/404.html","content":"I don't know how you ended up here, but you have jumped over the edge of this blog.

It was a revelation. I pointed my camera on everything and spend all my little money in developing the negatives and getting the prints. My first big purchase was a [Nikon F301](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F-301) with some additional lenses and some equipment for my own black/white darkroom at home in the  bathroom, for the joy of my family.\n\nSince then, I'm addicted to photography. I have even tried to become a photographer and started an apprenticeship in Frankfurt/Main after leaving school, but due to lack of support, I have given it up in favor of a \"decent\" profession, as my father would say ;)\n\nToday a have a lot of equipment, knowing that a good picture is done by the photographer and not by the camera, but it's part of the fun, carrying 3 ore more kilos around my shoulder, to grab the right lens for the right shot.\n\nFind some of my photographs on **500px** --- [https://500px.com/p/kikon](https://500px.com/p/kikon)\n\n</section>\n\n<section>\n\n# The Developer\n\nI'm a creative person and most people are shaking their heads in disbelief, when I'm telling them, that IT has a lot to do with creativity and not with math.\n\nWhile learning a lot of stuff about business as an industrial clerk trainee at the German headquarter of [Prime Computer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Computer) around 1990 (the decent profession), there was a guy in the warehouse, Colin Urquhart, who was working with a new type of computer, a x68 machine from IBM and he taught me something about it and ignited my fascination about the possibilities of a computer.\n\n<div style=\"width: 150px; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; float: right\">\n<img src=\"index/logo-prime.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-seperator.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-fh-wiesbaden.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-seperator.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-division-by-zero.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-seperator.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-goetzfried.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-seperator.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-allgeier-experts.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-seperator.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-svg.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n</div>\n\nA little later I got in touch with a i386DX computer from Escom and started to fiddle around on how to achieve this or that under MS-DOS, installing Windows 3.x from a dozen of 3.5 discs, connecting via a 14.4k modem to the FidoNet (greets to all the guys from the 45er Infosystems) and talk shop with my fellow students at the [University of Applied Aciences, Wiesbaden](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hochschule_RheinMain), department of economics.\n\nOne of our teachers gave me a copy of Microsoft Access 1.1 and I started to explore the possibilities of this new relational database system. A short time later, our professor for computer science wanted to switch teaching DBase towards Access and so I became his assistant and held some class hours, where one of my students, having a little company on selling hardware, was asking me someday, if I was interested building Access-based software for his clients. I said yes. My starting point into a career as a freelance software developer.\n\nYears later, after dozens of clients, authoring a [book about Access](https://www.amazon.de/Das-Access-VBA-Codebook-Carsten-Grie%C3%9Fhammer/dp/3827319536), coming and going technologies, building (and leaving) my own company [Division by Zero](https://www.division-by-zero.de/) with my good friend [Marcus Michaels](https://de.linkedin.com/in/marcus-michaels-2896258a), I'm now Head of Software Development at [SVG](https://svg.de) in Frankfurt, leading a bunch of cool software designers and engineers on developing good and relevant software ... and my creativity is demanded day by day.\n\nI'm still first and foremost fascinated by the technology on building software, in particular in creating pleasing, but functional UI's, a user wants to works with, even if I spend my daily working time on management stuff. So it is not surprising that I sit at my laptop in my spare time, working on my private projects or trying out new technologies.
