    <description>Writing about the state of the world as a cusp Millennial/Gen Z that grew up in the optimistic Obama era, contrasting that with what today holds for us.</description>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Let me write a personal blog entry today. The world shows no signs of slowing down, of the catastrophe being calmed. There is no extinguisher in the arson'd room with us.</p><p>And I think I'm okay with that. I have found myself steadfast on a handful of principles. To help as much as I sustainably can, and to not let the oppressive and violent forces of the world remove my joy nor optimism for a hopeful, better future.</p><p>The suffering is nothing new, the modality of suffering is novel for our generation, though. We were supposed to bear witness to world peace, economic stability, civil discussion and debate. A well-nourished community of diverse neighbours who welcome us with open arms.</p><p>I am a cusp baby<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://brennan.day/#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, I was born in 1996. This is on the edge of marketing generational demographics known as millennial and generation Z. I do not know a lot of people my age in comparison to other ages, because there are statistically not a lot of people my age. There was a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_12.pdf">lull in birth rates</a> in the 1990's. The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10071841/">overall birth rate declined 15 percent between 1991 and 1997</a>, and <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/the-decline-in-u-s-fertility/">fertility rates fell across all groups during that decade</a>. We are a smaller cohort, caught between the echo boom of the late 80s and the millennial surge of the early 2000s.</p><p>And I bring this up because I grew up in a world that was only looking upward and progressive. I was twelve-years-old when <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/november-4/barack-obama-elected-as-americas-first-black-president">Obama became President of the United States on November 4, 2008</a>. After the geopolitical shift of 9/11 and the growing mainstream disapproval of the Iraq war, it seemed as though people were choosing love. Seeing that love is love. The American Experiment was still ongoing, still heartbeating.</p><p>I know now, nearly twenty years later, what an illusion this all was. There certainly was nothing progressive about Obama. But much worse than that, the great pendulum began swinging the other way once again. A pendulum I grew up believing could only go one way. I grew up in schools hosting assemblies to fight homophobia and racism. The walls were covered in the impact-font propaganda posters of acceptance and openness and tolerance. I went to my first pride parade when I was in middle school, and felt completely safe.</p><p>In my own province of Alberta, the conservative party lost their 44-year reign in 2015 when <a href="https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/02/19/Rachel-Notley-Actually-Achieved/">Rachel Notley of the NDP (New Democratic Party, more left than Canada's Liberal party) was elected premier</a>. The <a href="https://albertaviews.ca/orange-chinook/">so-called &quot;Orange Chinook&quot;</a> swept through the province on May 5, 2015, ending <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/blue-giant-alberta-pcs-now-longest-serving-government-in-canadian-history">the longest-serving provincial government in Canadian history</a>. Even the stereotype of this cowboy-drenched oil-slicked city was turning a tide. Surely.</p><p>We know this did not hold. We know that malevolent powers-that-be itched for more. Power, money, resources. Anything. Not love, though.</p><p>We lost a lot in 2016. <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/election-results-2016-clinton-trump-231070">Trump's victory over Clinton</a>, just months after <a href="https://www.jrf.org.uk/public-attitudes/brexit-vote-explained-poverty-low-skills-and-lack-of-opportunities">Britain voted to leave the European Union</a>, felt like the certitude of a turning point. Apolitical centrists and those on the right told us we were overreacting, deranged, or hysterical.</p><p>It has only taken a decade for us to be proven wholly correct. Children in cages. American citizens murdered by federal law enforcement. Elsewhere, genocides occurring with the help of American tax-paying money. With <em>my</em> tax-paying money.</p><p>But I echo back my original sentiment: what we had prior to 2016 was a nice, well-kept illusion. 2016 did not just spontaneously happen. It was just far easier to ignore, far easier to focus on the unimportant quarrels which distracted us from the well-hidden atrocities.</p><p>Hm. Why do I write all of this? I think to help myself recalibrate. I need to recalibrate often. I need to take stock of all that I ought to be grateful for, and by God, it is so much. And I need to remind myself that the optics are not the thing. The aesthetic of America's downfall is vibrant and pulsing right now, but the rot has been growing underneath the floorboards. We've known this.</p><p>I meditate on the immense suffering but I do not let myself fall into the seductive, gaping maw of the abyss it holds. It is my civic duty to continue, to forge hope and love where it is so desperately needed, and to share it with those who can no longer forge it for themselves.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/ginsburg-s-pendulum">Ruth Ginsburg</a> said:</p><blockquote><p>“I am optimistic in the long run. A great man once said that the true symbol of the United States is not the bald eagle. It is the pendulum. And when the pendulum swings too far in one direction it will go back.”</p></blockquote><p>I think this is why I am still stubbornly an institutionalist. I believe we can claw back civility. We can create a better future without yet another apocalypse. Maybe. I have faith in our governing capabilities the way I have faith in God. But how I wrestle. How could I not? The atheist can go line-by-line and so easily articulate my foolishness. But the sacred is invisible and the colour of the wind.</p><hr class="footnotes-sep" /><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Zillenials are described as being &quot;raised less by optimistic Boomers and more by skeptical Xers and pragmatic Gen Jonesers, who raised them to focus more on the practical rather than the aspirational.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusper#cite_note-UblWalden2017-21">Source</a><a href="https://brennan.day/#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section>

    <description>How creative ambition transforms into a trap of endless expansion, examining YouTube essayists, neoliberal work culture, and the pressure to constantly optimize artistic output</description>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Everyone suffers from scope creep, especially good artists finding their footing. A good visualization of this is with YouTubers, specifically video essayists. They'll start with simple production and whichever B-roll is affordable in order to present their points. And from the experience of producing a video essay, their next is better-researched and with a higher production value with a longer runtime. The next after is even more elaborate, taking months now instead of weeks.</p><p>Sometimes, these YouTubers will make second channels that have shorter, off-the-cuff videos that are reminiscent of their original work. But if they're <em>really</em> good, even these secondary YouTube channels will fall victim to scope creep. Again, the production value will go up, the time between videos as well.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ContraPoints">Natalie Wynn</a>, known as ContraPoints, is a good example. When she started making videos in 2016, she was in front of a camera talking about politics and philosophy. Over time, her production evolved into theatrical productions with <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2021/02/16/the-rise-of-the-video-essay-as-art-contrapoints/">dramatic lighting, costumes, and set designs</a>. Videos that journalists have called &quot;the mold of Oscar Wilde by way of Weird Twitter.&quot; What began as accessible video essays became hour-long films taking months to produce, each one more ambitious than the last.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hbomberguy">Harris Brewis (HBomberguy)</a> followed a similar trajectory. His channel started with straightforward video responses and gaming critiques. Now he produces heavily-researched, multi-hour documentaries. His 2023 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDp3cB5fHXQ">plagiarism investigation</a> ran four hours. I can't imagine how much fact-checking and consultation with experts went into it. Production timelines keep stretching out endlessly. And what for, exactly?</p><p>Even Big Joel, whose main channel features analysis of media and culture, created <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@littlestjoel">Little Joel</a> as a secondary outlet for looser, more casual content. Joel himself has mentioned losing &quot;the bone in my body that tweets&quot; after making Little Joel videos. His attempt at a more relaxed format began demanding his creative energy. It's so antithetical.</p><h2 id="the-weight-of-neoliberal-expansion" tabindex="-1">The Weight of Neoliberal Expansion <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-weight-of-neoliberal-expansion" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>I believe all of this is symptomatic of being part of a Neoliberal world. To feel compelled to always expand, always do more. The entire world's media digest has become more radical and hyperbolic. And it feels as though we need to follow suite.</p><p>I sympathize. There is just <em>so</em> much to consume, after all. And most of it can be consumed for free or on a subscription service people are already paying for.</p><p>&quot;<a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/transformation/oppressiveness-of-creativity/">Being creative today means seeing the world around you as a resource to fuel your inner entrepreneur.</a> Creativity is a distinctly neoliberal trait because it feeds the notion that the world and everything in it can be monetised.&quot;</p><p>The constant pressure toward entrepreneurialism and productivity has mutated creativity itself in the pressure cooker of advanced capitalism. We are trapped in the pressure cooker to be ever more creative and original; such demands are an inescapable part of the capitalist structures we occupy.</p><p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03098168211022208">Research on neoliberal work culture</a> shows how management's enforcement of targets and the expectancy to overwork generates psychological distress, instability, pressure and a negative working environment. We believe we must constantly optimize, improve, produce more with better quality has become the &quot;commonsense way we interpret, live in, and understand the world.&quot;</p><h2 id="my-own-treadmill" tabindex="-1">My Own Treadmill <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#my-own-treadmill" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>I confess I am not immune to the artist's treadmill. I have been writing non-stop the past few months. It's been fun, I think I had a backlog of ideas that was brimming because I was in university for fall, winter, spring, and summer semesters four years straight. I had no free time to work on my own writing.</p><p>Those years blur together now. The turning of seasons marked only by course schedules. Spring and summer semesters meant two classes each, not only to finish school on time but frankly because it allowed me to continue getting student loans. Four years of writing papers for professors instead of for myself. Four years of watching leaves turn gold outside library windows while I highlighted passages about other people's ideas. Four years of storing up my own thoughts. Water behind a dam.</p><p>But I need to actively, intentionally remind myself that the entire reason I created <a href="https://brennan.day/">https://brennan.day</a> was to have a joyful <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> personal site that I could do whatever the hell I wanted on. It is not supposed to be parity with my Medium account where I now make a full-time living writing near-daily.</p><h2 id="the-paradox-of-good-intentions" tabindex="-1">The Paradox of Good Intentions <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-paradox-of-good-intentions" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>I think a lot of the scope creep comes from a place of well-intention. We feel obligated to our already-existing audience to give them more, to provide value and utility. Not out of wanting validation, but because we want to benefit people; we want to do good for the world.</p><p>I've actually been posting <em>more</em> on brennan.day than Medium, mostly it has been coding tutorials after adding features to my website, because I want to share that with others, I want to make the act of creating your own IndieWeb personal site easier. The gates always need to be lowered.</p><p>But it all feels so serious, so white-knuckled and with my shoulders-tense. As though there is a part of me that is pathologically unable to just output whatever, to shitpost or to get loose-goosey with it.</p><p>I've been trying to deliberately resist these inclinations. I guess that's partly why I started a personal journal on my <a href="https://tilde.town/">tilde.town</a> account. And I guess that's also why I wrote my first satire a few days ago. But it's still all so neat and tidy.</p><h2 id="the-absurdity-of-self-imposed-standards" tabindex="-1">The Absurdity of Self-Imposed Standards <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-absurdity-of-self-imposed-standards" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Nobody is asking me for what I do. I think my audience are nomadic by nature because of how I just write whatever the hell I want. And also because I'm inexperienced and not nearly as skillful as writers who have amassed loyal fans. All of that is fine, it just makes the idea that I am so stringent with my standards all the more absurd.</p><p>I end up coming across as this deeply serious, pretentious person when I'm the furthest thing from. I think so lightly of myself and take so few things seriously. It is a bizarre persona born from years of masking that it hard to shake off.</p><h2 id="ways-forward" tabindex="-1">Ways Forward <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#ways-forward" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>So how do I—how do we—break out of this cycle? What could I be doing on brennan.day that would open things up for me?</p><p><strong>Embrace the quick and dirty.</strong> Set a timer for 15 minutes and publish whatever comes out. No editing. No second-guessing. The <a href="https://jennyinneverland.com/2020/11/23/blogging-for-fun/">spirit of early blogging</a> was exactly this. Raw thoughts, unpolished edges, the authentic voice.</p><p><strong>Create deliberate constraints.</strong> Instead of always adding more, try adding less. A 200-word post. A single photograph with a caption. A poem written on your phone. Your website should be a place where you &quot;<a href="https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started">can post anything you want, in any format you want, with no one monitoring you.</a>&quot;</p><p><strong>Establish &quot;shitpost Saturdays&quot; or &quot;draft Thursdays.&quot;</strong> Give myself permission to publish the unfinished, the half-baked, the weird thoughts. Make it a recurring thing.</p><p><strong>Experiment with different formats.</strong> Voice notes transcribed directly to text. Screenshots of your Notes app. A running list of things that made you laugh this week. A photo dump with zero context.</p><p><strong>Remember why you began.</strong> Before the analytics, before the audience, before the pressure to perform. What was the joy? What was the play? What made you want to create in the first place? Go back to that.</p><p><strong>Lower the stakes.</strong> Not everything needs to be a polished thinkpiece that &quot;provides value.&quot; Sometimes a website can just be a website. A place where you exist, where you think out loud, where you make something because making things is fundamentally human.</p><p>Good work comes from imperfect, messy, shitty margins. From not trying so hard. Creativity is supposed to be joyful. The scope creep happens when we forget that. When we turn play into work, spontaneity into strategy, self-expression into self-optimization.</p><p>Lower the gates for ourselves as much as for everyone else.</p>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>I am somebody that dives into both the literary (which is typically navel-gazing thinkpieces that are philosophical in air quotes) and the technical (where I usually just wrestle with a weird npm build bug for several hours).</p><p>One of the biggest topics I've been focused on the past while is the IndieWeb, also known as the independent Internet. In the simplest terms, this means owning your content and platform instead of using corporate social media that engages in dark practices like surveillance capitalism. Nearly every single person that uses the Internet does NOT use the IndieWeb. We're all on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, or God forbid, X.</p><p>Why do I care so much about this? Beyond the unethical practices of these platforms who are solely aligned to gaining maximum profits to their shareholders, the truth is I am trying to find viable alternatives and harm reductions because <em>everyone</em> is addicted to the Internet, or at the very least are extremely dependent on their Internet-connected devices.</p><p>There are some people that advocate for no-tech or &quot;digital detoxes&quot;, but these are equivalent to crash diets. I believe transitioning to the IndieWeb is the most sustainable, best solution for people.</p><p>But, frankly, the IndieWeb is still incredibly nerdy and technical. I've gotten comments on my previous articles of people saying they didn't know where to start.</p><p>The last thing I want to do is alienate my audience, which is what happens sometimes when I am writing whatever the hell I want to.</p><p>But, of course, this is also by design. It is easy and free to sign up to corporate social media (although it is getting increasingly difficult, isn't it? Having to verify your identity or even hand over your ID to these private companies? I certainly hope you haven't done that!)</p><p>So, all of this is to say I am writing this article to hopefully get people that have ZERO technical knowledge onto the IndieWeb.</p><p>Now, this guide isn't perfect. Being truly independent requires a level of technical knowledge. Even with my own <a href="https://brennan.day/">personal site</a> which I built from scratch, I'm still hosting on Netlify and my code is on <a href="https://gitlab.com/brennankbrown/brennan.day">GitLab</a>.</p><p>But there are absolutely options to begin the transition. You'll be using someone else's platforms, but your work will be far easier to import/export. My recommendations are platforms that are not seeking to maximize profits by <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/the-last-days-of-social-media/">any means necessary</a>, or run by <a href="https://www.advocate.com/opinion/tim-cook-melania-trump">billionaires that are friendly</a> with the Trump administration.</p><p>The core principle is <strong>own your domain, own your content, own your identity.</strong></p><h2 id="a-domain-of-ones-own" tabindex="-1">A Domain of One's Own <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#a-domain-of-ones-own" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Before anything else, the best thing you can do for yourself it to buy a domain. <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a> is my recommendation, with some first-year costs being as low as a couple dollars. Choose something personal or fun, like your name, a phrase you love, whatever feels right. This is yours! The IndieWeb wiki has <a href="https://indieweb.org/A_Domain_of_One%27s_Own">a good article</a> on this.</p><p>Now, what do you <em>do</em> with this domain? You'll connect it with one of the platforms I'll be showing below. Now, this <em>is</em> a little technical, but it essentially boils down to changing some numbers and words on the settings page. This is different for each domain manager and platform, but I promise it isn't as scary as it seems with all the technical words like DNS records and CNAME and IP addresses. I will help you about this one-on-one free-of-charge if you need!</p><h3 id="e-mail-bonus" tabindex="-1">E-mail Bonus <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#e-mail-bonus" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>An aside: Another thing I love about Porkbun is that they have effortless email forwarding. What does this mean? That you can give people the email name@yourwebsite.xyz and have any emails send to that address forwarded to your actual already-existing email. For instance, I have <a href="mailto:mail@brennanbrown.ca">mail@brennanbrown.ca</a>, which looks a lot more professional than <a href="mailto:brennankbrown@gmail.com">brennankbrown@gmail.com</a></p><h2 id="the-actual-guide" tabindex="-1">The Actual Guide <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-actual-guide" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><em>&quot;But I'm Not Technical!&quot;</em> I hear you say.</p><p>I have an English degree, not a computer science degree. I learned to code because I wanted to build things, not because I was naturally gifted at it. You don't need to be. You just need to be curious and willing to try.</p><p>The IndieWeb has options for every skill level:</p><h3 id="level-0-no-code-required" tabindex="-1">Level 0: No Code Required <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#level-0-no-code-required" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>Start with platforms that handle the technical stuff for you:</p><p><strong><a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/brennan">omg.lol</a></strong> ($20/year) gives you a domain, a simple profile page, a status log, email forwarding, and access to a genuinely kind community. You can write posts using their weblog feature without touching a single line of code. The founder, Adam Newbold, explicitly rejects surveillance capitalism and AI scraping. It's $20 a year.</p><p><strong><a href="https://pika.page/">Pika.page</a></strong> (free for 50 posts, then $6/month) is a beautiful blogging platform with a guestbook, image uploads, and simple theming. The writing experience is clean and distraction-free. When you hit 50 posts, you'll know you're serious enough to either pay for it or graduate to something more complex.</p><p><strong><a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a></strong> (free) is ultra-minimalist—just text, no frills. If you don't need images or fancy formatting, this might be perfect.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/">DreamWidth</a></strong> is a more old-school feeling blogging site that is a spiritual successor to the more well-known LiveJournal. It's user-funded but has a flexible free tier, and it also has the option to enable comments. There's a lively community there!</p><p>These platforms give you a domain, RSS feeds, and the ability to own your content. You can export everything and move elsewhere if you want. You're not locked in.</p><p>You'll learn <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, which is just plain text with simple formatting, and that renders into HTML. You write like this:</p><pre class="language-markdown"><code class="language-markdown"><span class="token title important"><span class="token punctuation">#</span> This is a heading</span>This is a paragraph with <span class="token bold"><span class="token punctuation">**</span><span class="token content">bold text</span><span class="token punctuation">**</span></span> and <span class="token italic"><span class="token punctuation">*</span><span class="token content">italic text</span><span class="token punctuation">*</span></span>.<span class="token list punctuation">-</span> This is a list<span class="token list punctuation">-</span> With multiple items</code></pre><h3 id="level-1-a-little-html-goes-a-long-way" tabindex="-1">Level 1: A Little HTML Goes a Long Way <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#level-1-a-little-html-goes-a-long-way" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>If you're willing to learn some basics, <a href="https://neocities.org/">NeoCities</a> (free) lets you build your own site from scratch.

Text with some angle brackets telling the browser what's a heading, what's a paragraph, what's a link. CSS is the styling—colors, fonts, layout. That's it. You're not writing complex algorithms.

I use <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, a static site generator that takes Markdown files and turns them into a full website.</p><p>Eleventy handles the rest. Generating pages, creating navigation, building RSS feeds, etc. You can start with a template (like my <a href="https://github.com/brennanbrown/11ty-Indie-Web-Blog-Starter">11ty IndieWeb Blog Starter</a>) and customize it as you learn.</p><p>Static sites are fast, secure, and cheap to host. No database to maintain, no server to manage. Just files.</p><h2 id="what-you-actually-get" tabindex="-1">What You Actually Get? <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#what-you-actually-get" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>My site at <a href="https://brennan.day/">brennan.day</a> is <em>mine</em>. The design reflects my personality—rainbow gradients, a Gruvbox-inspired color scheme, 88x31 badges from the '90s web. I can change anything I want, any time I want. No brand guidelines, no platform restrictions.</p><h2 id="community" tabindex="-1">Community <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#community" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>So, how do you find new people to connect with?</p><p>First, get on <a href="https://mastodon.social/">Mastodon</a>! It's like an old-school, decentralized Twitter. Free and open source. You can <a href="https://mastodon.social/signup">sign up</a> and join the <a href="https://indieweb.social/">IndieWeb community</a>. Then, you can use a service like <a href="https://echofeed.app/">Echofeed</a> to automatically publish your blog posts to your Mastodon account when you publish them on your own site.</p><p>I'm also part of several different <a href="https://indieweb.org/webring">webrings</a>, which are collections of websites linked together. When someone visits my site, they can click &quot;next&quot; or &quot;random&quot; to discover other sites in the ring.</p><p>I have a <a href="https://brennan.day/blogroll/">blogroll</a>, a list of other blogs I read. When I find something interesting, I link to it. That's how we used to build community online, and it still works.</p><p>Much more advanced: I built a comment system using <a href="https://indieauth.com/">IndieAuth</a>, which means people can comment using their own websites as identity. No creating yet another account. No giving an email to yet another company. Just their domain name.</p><p>Much more advanced: Using <a href="https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/">Micropub</a> and <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a>, I can <a href="https://brennan.day/posting-to-your-static-site-with-quill-and-micropub/">write posts from my phone and publish them to my site</a>. I don't need to log into a Git repository or edit files directly. The IndieWeb has thought about usability.</p><h2 id="multiple-homes" tabindex="-1">Multiple Homes <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#multiple-homes" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>One of the great things about the IndieWeb is that it is super easy to mirror/back-up your stuff. My site is mirrored to <a href="https://brennanday.neocities.org/">NeoCities</a> automatically (I wrote about that <a href="https://brennan.day/deploying-an-eleventy-site-to-neocities-with-gitlab-ci-cd/">here</a>).</p><p>I also have a presence on <a href="https://tilde.town/~brennan">Tilde.town</a>, an SSH-based community. And I post to <a href="https://status.lol/">status.lol</a>, which syncs to my site's <a href="https://brennan.day/twtxt-simple-decentralized-microblogging-with-status-lol/">twtxt</a>.</p><p>If any platform disappears tomorrow, I still have my site. My content doesn't vanish with someone else's business model. The site is the hub and everything else is a spoke.</p><h2 id="reaching-readers" tabindex="-1">Reaching Readers <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#reaching-readers" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><em>&quot;If I'm not on a platform, how will anyone find my work?&quot;</em></p><p>The truth is, most people on platforms aren't finding your work either. The algorithm shows your posts to a tiny fraction of your followers. You're shouting into a void that occasionally echoes back.</p><p>On the IndieWeb, you build an audience differently:</p><p><strong>RSS feeds</strong> let people subscribe to your site. When you publish something new, it shows up in their feed reader.</p><p><strong>Directories and webrings</strong> help people discover your site. <a href="https://blogroll.org/">Ye Olde Blogroll</a>, <a href="https://ooh.directory/">Ooh Directory</a>, and <a href="https://personalsit.es/">Personal Sites</a> are all human-curated collections of independent websites.</p><p><strong>Search engines</strong> still exist. <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb/">Kagi</a> has a Small Web search specifically for independent sites. <a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/">Marginalia</a> favors text-heavy websites over SEO-optimized content farms.</p><p><a href="https://webmention.io/"><strong>Webmentions</strong></a> are more advanced, but they notify you when someone links to your post from their own site. It's a thoughtful version of retweets, people are writing actual responses, not just hitting a button.</p><p>The audience you build is smaller but more engaged. These are people who chose to follow you, not people who doomscroll past your posts between ads.</p><h2 id="challenges" tabindex="-1">Challenges <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#challenges" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>There's a learning curve. Even simple platforms require learning new tools. You'll need to understand domains, hosting, and basic web concepts.</p><p>Building a site takes time. Customizing it takes more time. Writing posts, maintaining links, engaging with the community. All takes time.</p><p>You will have fewer readers than on Substack or Medium, at least initially. If your goal is maximum reach, corporate platforms <em>are</em> more efficient.</p><p>Things will break. Links will stop working. You'll need to troubleshoot. But there are guides and such a helpful community.</p><h2 id="its-worth-it" tabindex="-1">It's Worth It <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#its-worth-it" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Every word you write on Medium or Substack or Threads is subject to their terms of service. They can delete it, hide it, or change how it's displayed. Entire platforms come and go. MySpace, Google+, Vine? taking millions of posts with them. Your domain and your files persist as long as you maintain them.</p><p>Your site is yours forever.</p><p>No ads unless you choose them. No feeds to make you anxious. Just your words and the people who want to read them.</p><p>The IndieWeb community is genuinely kind and looking to help newcomers. People share their code, answer questions, and celebrate each other's work.</p><h2 id="how-to-start-today" tabindex="-1">How to Start Today <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#how-to-start-today" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>If you're ready to try, here's what I recommend:</p><p>Buy a domain from <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a> ($10/year). Choose something personal—your name, a phrase you love, whatever feels right. This is your digital land.</p><p>Start with <a href="https://pika.page/">Pika.page</a> or <a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/brennan">omg.lol</a>. Both are beginner-friendly and give you a working site immediately. Write your first post. Don't overthink it.</p><p>Write about yourself with an <code>/about</code> page. What do you care about? What do you write? Why should someone read your work? This is your <code>/about</code> page, and it's more important than you think.</p><p>Then, if you're so inclined, you can create more <a href="https://slashpages.net/">slash pages</a>, detailing your interests, your projects, your collections, whatever you like!</p><p>Find other IndieWeb sites through <a href="https://ooh.directory/">directories</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.org/webring">webrings</a>. Comment on posts you enjoy. Link to work you admire. Start building your corner of the web.</p><p>Then, try the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days to Offload</a> challenge, write 100 posts in a year. Join the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb community</a>. Experiment with <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">RSS readers</a>. See what resonates.</p><h2 id="the-writing-matters-most" tabindex="-1">The Writing Matters Most <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-writing-matters-most" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><strong>The technology serves the writing, not the other way around.</strong></p><p>I can teach you about the technology all I want, but at the end of the day, you do just need to write. You don't need a perfect site. You don't need to understand every technical detail. You just need a place to post, and the willingness to share it.</p><p>I've imported and written over 80 posts on my IndieWeb site in the past two months, stuff I've written since the start of 2025. Technical tutorials, personal essays, and some just silly observations. None approved by algorithms or optimized for engagement.</p><p>I write what I want, when I want, how I want. That freedom is worth every hour I spent learning HTML.</p><h2 id="harm-reduction" tabindex="-1">Harm Reduction <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#harm-reduction" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>You don't have to choose. This isn't all-or-nothing. You can keep your social media and start an IndieWeb site. My entire ethos here is to start small but keep at it, do what works for you.</p><p>The IndieWeb philosophy is <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a>.Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. Your site is the canonical source, but you can share your work wherever your readers are.</p><h2 id="an-invitation" tabindex="-1">An Invitation <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#an-invitation" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>The independent web is already here, quietly thriving while Big Tech is collapsing in real-time under its own extractive weight.</p><p>Writers, artists, poets, and creators are building their own spaces, linking to each other, forming communities based on shared interests rather than algorithmic recommendations.</p><p>You don't need to be technical to join us. You just need to be willing to try something different.</p><p>Start small. Buy a domain. Write a post. Link to someone else's work. See how it feels to own your corner of the internet. The tools are here. The community is welcoming.</p><p>The only thing missing is you.</p>

Our ability to grow not despite devastation, but <em>because</em> of it. To always continue. To be first.</p><p>This is the spirit I'm building a writing community around.</p><h2 id="i" tabindex="-1">I. <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#i" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><strong>You want to be a writer.</strong> You are brimming with stories inside of you waiting to be told. Where do you begin? I think a good answer to that question is right here. <a href="https://fireweed.school/"><strong>Fireweed Writing School.</strong></a></p><p>Fireweed Writing School will be an online creative collective focusing on a mission with two simple objectives: making you write <em>better</em> and making you write <em>more</em>.</p><p>I am starting this online school because it is exactly what I needed myself when I started writing over fifteen years ago. A community of like-minded (and weird) creatives and a focal point for the sacred art of writing.</p><p>I'm not going to bury the lede here. A lot of courses are on websites with expensive subscription models and ridiculous price tags. This is different.</p><p>I'm not tied to any corporation or company. I'm fully independent with nothing to upsell you with. What I'm announcing here is a writing school that charges <strong>$5* per class</strong>, running every two weeks, for a total of $10 per month.</p><p><small>* In Canadian dollars, so it's probably even cheaper for you.</small></p><h2 id="ii" tabindex="-1">II. <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#ii" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><strong>Who am I to say I have what it takes to be paid to teach you?</strong> I think that's an excellent question. My name is <a href="https://brennan.day/">Brennan</a>, but my friends call me Kenny. I started writing seriously over fifteen years ago. I've been <a href="https://bkpoetry.com/">writing poetry</a> and <a href="https://750words.com/person/brennan">in my journals</a> for a decade and a half. Over one million words and hundreds of works.</p><p>I've independently published nine of my own books, five of which are <a href="https://brennanbrown.gumroad.com/">available on Gumroad</a>. Not only did I do the writing, but I did the cover design, layout, formatting, and copyright. These books span over 1,500 pages total.</p><p>I recently graduated from Mount Royal University with a 3.8 GPA majoring in English Honours with a minor in creative writing. During my time in school, I published <a href="https://doi.org/10.29173/mruhr768">a scholarly article on Indigenous resilience</a> and my <a href="https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.25021.37600">honours thesis</a> which examined the importance of the English Degree and writing in today's age.</p><p>I also founded Write Club, a creative writing collective of young adults that grew from a couple students to 100+ members. I was the president of this club where we hosted open mics, fundraising events, and I ran dozens of workshops with hundreds of students for three years. We published two anthologies under my tenure: <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Fringe-Collection-Filth-Dana%C3%AB-Webb/dp/B0CYQ1NRY9"><em>&quot;On the Fringe: A Collection of Filth&quot;</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Fringe-Collection-Felix-Costa-Gomez/dp/B0F4PKFRZQ"><em>&quot;On the Fringe: A Collection of Community&quot;</em></a>, which are available to buy.</p><p>I'm a Queer Red River Métis, I know how important it is to centre marginalized voices and be mindful of how political writing is. Our voice and our ability to have a platform is directly imbued into my teaching.</p><p>What am I up to now? Well, I'm making a living by being a writer full-time on <a href="https://blog.brennanbrown.ca/">Medium</a>. I write articles on writing craft, literary criticism, digital culture, and Indigenous studies. I've published 200+ articles with my top pieces reaching 30,000 views. I write enough to have this be my job, and I'll be honest, it's my dream job.</p><p>That's exactly what I want to offer you.</p><h2 id="iii" tabindex="-1">III. <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#iii" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><a href="https://dailyprompt.com/blog/nanowrimo-shut-down-what-happened-rumors-explained-and-what-s-next-for-writers"><strong>NaNoWriMo imploded</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The organization that once provided structure for thousands of aspiring novelists <a href="https://www.the-plottery.com/blog/the-nanowrimo-shutdown-hurts-for-all-the-wrong-reasons">collapsed under its own weight</a>. <a href="https://littlevillagemag.com/nanowrimo-no-more/">Forum moderation failures that left minors unsafe</a>. <a href="https://cassmorriswrites.com/2024/09/02/no-more-nanowrimo/">A terrible AI stance</a> alienated writers who needed the organization most. <a href="https://selfpublishing.com/nanowrimo-controversy/">High-profile resignations</a>. The disconnect so profound between leadership and community that <a href="https://www.the-plottery.com/blog/the-nanowrimo-shutdown-hurts-for-all-the-wrong-reasons">even donated support was met with silence, blame, and deflection</a>.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month">On March 31, 2025, Executive Director Kilby Blades announced the closure</a>, citing &quot;financial struggles and community vitriol.&quot; No acknowledgement of harm. No recognition of grace offered and refused. An empty space now exists where that institution used to be.</p><p>There is an empty space there, now. And I'm not trying to replace NaNoWriMo, but the Fireweed Writing Club takes that empty space and plants something new.</p><h2 id="iv" tabindex="-1">IV. <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#iv" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><strong>My focus is Imagist-first.</strong><a href="https://triggerfishcriticalreview.com/historical-view-of-wcwilliams-no-ideas-but-in-things-by-ed-wickliffe/">No ideas but in things</a>. <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(14)00184-0/fulltext">William Carlos Williams</a> wrote those words in 1927, in <em>Paterson.</em> The physician-poet who <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(14)00184-0/fulltext">delivered more than 2,000 babies</a>, made innumerable house calls to the working-class triple-decker &quot;Bayonne boxes&quot; of Northern New Jersey, and somehow found the time to revolutionize American poetry. He died in Rutherford, the same New Jersey town where he was born. Consistency. Groundedness. <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/68731/william-carlos-williams-the-red-wheelbarrow">The belief that &quot;to speak about ideas, emotions, and abstractions, we must ground them firmly in the things of the world.&quot;</a></p><p>I'm going to teach you to avoid abstraction. To kill clichés and tropes before they murder the work. To create something genuinely your own.</p><p><a href="https://poetryispretentious.com/no-ideas-but-in-things/">Abstractions are lazy</a>. They let readers fill in their own meanings, which sounds democratic but actually creates distance. The concrete image, like the specific noun or the particular verb? That's what creates connection.</p><p>I want to teach writers to witness. To go out into the world, interact with it, find things, be curious, observe. To prioritize face-to-face experience and analog writing.</p><h2 id="v" tabindex="-1">V. <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#v" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><strong>The biggest barrier is psychology, not talent.</strong> Every aspiring writer I've worked with carries some version of the same wound: a self-imposed psychological barrier that tells them <em>they can't, they shouldn't, they're not good enough.</em> This barrier has a hundred names like imposter syndrome, perfectionism, or fear of judgment, but it all amounts to the same thing: silence.</p><p>There is no writer's block. You just write dogshit sometimes, and that's okay.</p><p>A hockey player doesn't get skater's block. A chef doesn't get cooking block. The act of writing is always available to us. We can always write something, even if it's bad. The constipation we feel is when we want to edit before we've created, when we want the first draft to be better than we're currently capable of producing.</p><p>The radical liberation I offer is the permission to write badly. Permission to write every day even when you don't feel like it. Permission to stop pressing backspace.</p><p>Write without editing. Write without stopping. Write garbage knowing the garbage composts into something rich.</p><h2 id="vi" tabindex="-1">VI. <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#vi" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><strong>What will we do?</strong> There will be several different components to this school. The biggest will be the workshops, where I'll lead and facilitate. These won't be your typical <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-iowa-flattened-literature/">Iowa-style workshops</a> that were <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2018/12/cia-helped-shaped-american-creative-writing-famous-iowa-writers-workshop.html">made popular during the Cold War era</a>.</p><p>Instead, I'll make sure the author is seen and heard. Drawing from <a href="https://lithub.com/how-to-build-an-antiracist-workshop/">anti-racist workshop practices</a> outlined in Felicia Rose Chavez's <a href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1552-the-anti-racist-writing-workshop"><em>The Anti-Racist Writing Workshop</em></a>, we'll create a <a href="https://www.antiracistworkshop.com/">safe space for creative concentration</a> where participants retain their own authority and artistic preferences throughout the creative process.</p><p>In addition to workshopping, I'll give you assignments. Beyond the assignments, I'll help you figure out how to carve time, space, and energy into your life for writing. For a lot of us, that seems impossible. And that's exactly what Fireweed School is here for.</p><p>This is also a community-driven collective, meaning we'll produce work together. There will be an active social channel, zine-making, and you'll have a chance to contribute to an anthology at the end of the semester.</p><p>I also want you to prioritize analog writing. I want you to keep a commonplace book dedicated to this class. A physical notebook where you allow yourself to get imperfect and messy. Collect quotes, observations, fragments, sketches of ideas.</p><p>Also, build your own reading list. I'll show you how to find books. Anna's Archive, Library Genesis, your local library, used bookstores. You'll curate your own literary education based on what you actually want to read, not what some syllabus demands.</p><p>Most importantly, I will do every assignment I ask you to do. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food"><strong>Dogfood</strong></a>.

From idea to first draft. From first draft to revision. From revision to query letter. From query letter to submission. From submission to publication.</p><p>I want to take you through the entire process. Not because getting published is the only valid outcome (it isn't) but because finishing work and sending it into the world is part of the craft. Too many writing classes treat publication as someone else's problem.</p><p>It's not. It's ours. We will create our own publication. What can we give the world? What do we collectively, as a class, enjoy and want to see more of? The answers to those questions will shape what we build together.</p><h2 id="viii" tabindex="-1">VIII. <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#viii" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><strong>I will also teach student writers how to be literary citizen journalists.</strong> Understanding the landscape of publication, of literary communities, of how work moves through the world. It means learning enough tech to get your own website and own your digital land.</p><p>The platforms will fail you. Substack will be acquired or pivot. Twitter has already burned to the ground. The only thing you truly own is your domain, your site, your email list.</p><p>I will teach you how to claim that for yourself.</p><h2 id="ix" tabindex="-1">IX. <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#ix" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><strong>A balance must exist between lifting the gates on academic ivory-tower elitism and recognizing that we must put in the work.</strong> We are not designed for expediency. We have so much of it already. So much content optimized for engagement rather than meaning. Writing existing to fill algorithmic slots.</p><p>This class asks you to slow down. To struggle. To revise and revise again. To read work that challenges you. To write work that challenges you. That doesn't mean gatekeeping. The craft is available to anyone willing to do the work. But <em>willing to do the work</em> is the key phrase.</p><p>I will not teach shortcuts.</p><h2 id="x" tabindex="-1">X. <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#x" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><strong>Finally, do not come to my class expecting to make it big or make a lot of money.</strong> You must want to elevate the craft of your writing. You must want to learn how to write every day even when you don't feel like it. I will not teach you to be a famous, wealthy author. I can't promise that, and anyone who does is lying.</p><p>But I will teach you how to be a writer.</p><p>By the end of your experience with me and this project, you will have a body of work. Actual pages. Actual publications. Actual evidence that you showed up and did the thing.</p><p>That's what I can promise.</p><h2 id="interested" tabindex="-1">Interested? <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#interested" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>I truly believe writing is medicine, and that there is something sacred when community is cultivated in good faith.

    <description>What is the future of coding bootcamps? Is there a future? And, more importantly, what is the future of junior developers in an industry with an effortless AI bubble?</description>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>On a damp October evening in 2013, a handful of developers in Vancouver's Gastown gathered around folding tables. It was a wonderful, ideal concept they discussed as their MacBook screens glowed. <em>What if you didn't need four years and six figures of debt to become a programmer?</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_Labs">Launch Academy</a>, now known as Lighthouse Labs, was founded.</p><p>The idea was already in the process of picking up momentum elsewhere, with the first coding bootcamps beginning in 2011. The idea was to take the disruption of Silicon Valley to the education that would teach their future developers: 12 weeks of sprinting and distilled focus, alchemizing baristas and accountants and oil workers facing layoffs all into employable web and software developers</p><p>That idea was good enough to hold for over a decade. Lighthouse Labs became <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/10-years-of-lighthouse-labs-lessons-learned">Canada's flagship coding bootcamp</a>, training an impressive 40,000 students across six cities in Canada. Cohorts graduated every few months, with students walking out as &quot;junior developers,&quot; GitHub portfolios brimming with green tiles indicating hard work done with React components and Flask APIs.</p><p>And the stats coming out of these bootcamps were impressive, weren't they? 80% placement rates with six-figure starting salaries. Pipelines straight into Google and Shopify and hundreds of venture-backed startups raising millions.</p><p>Let me ask you reader, where do you think this story goes from here?</p><h2 id="the-acquisition" tabindex="-1">The Acquisition <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-acquisition" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Last year, on <a href="https://www.bctechnology.com/news/2025/8/8/Canada-Wide-Technical-Training-Firm-Lighthouse-Labs-(and-Acquiring-Company-Uvaro)-File-for-Bankruptcy.cfm">January 14, 2025</a>, Lighthouse Labs announced its acquisition by Uvaro, a workforce development company.</p><p>The press release had the usual corporate euphemisms. It was a &quot;strategic expansion&quot; with &quot;Canada's largest workforce development organization&quot; ensuring &quot;future-ready skills for an AI-augmented economy.&quot;</p><p>Jeremy Shaki, Lighthouse Labs' co-founder and CEO, engineered the sale after two previous failed attempts to find a buyer of the bootcamp. The writing, he said later, had been on the wall for months.</p><p>&quot;<a href="https://betakit.com/still-processing-lighthouse-labs-co-founder-shares-lessons-from-sale-to-uvaro-and-bankruptcy/">All the headwinds are coming against us</a>,&quot; Shaki told an audience at Toronto's MaRS Discovery District in October, describing the company's final year. There were layoffs, the existential collapse of the entry-level job market.</p><p>And, of course, AI. The posthuman spectre controlling what a junior developer was worth, now.</p><p>Uvaro raised capital to fund the acquisition. They were planning to integrate Lighthouse Labs' technical training with Uvaro's sale and customer success programs to create a &quot;full-spectrum&quot; workforce platform. For seven months, classes continued as normal. Students showed up and instructors taught. The lights stayed on.</p><figure><img src="https://brennan.day/assets/images/blog/lighthouse-bankrupt.jpg" alt="Lighthouse Labs website showing bankruptcy trustee notice" /><figcaption>LighthouseLabs.ca now redirects to a bankruptcy trustee notice</figcaption></figure><p>On <a href="https://vantechjournal.com/p/uvaro-owner-of-lighthouse-labs-files-for-bankruptcy-37e0">August 1, 2025</a>, both companies filed for bankruptcy. <a href="https://betakit.com/bankruptcy-docs-claim-faltering-sales-pipeline-sunk-uvaro-and-lighthouse-labs-post-acquisition/">All employees from both companies were terminated immediately</a>.</p><p>Digital skills courses already in session stopped instantly. Students had course access revoked mid-program.</p><p>The trustee's bankruptcy documents explained how Lighthouse Labs had approximately $230,000 in assets against liabilities exceeding $3 million. And Uvaro listed $1.6 million in assets against $5.7 million in liabilities.</p><p>The collapse was as sudden as it was total. <a href="https://lighthouselabs.com/">Websites</a> redirected to bankruptcy trustees. Phone lines went dead. Slack channels where thousands of alumni chatted were shuttering.</p><p>&quot;I watched someone for six months who ran it with really good intentions and strong vision, strong capabilities, make mistakes that I didn't have the control over,&quot; Shaki reflected months later, still processing. He acknowledged the toll:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Nobody called me an asshole, but [I] felt like one because [I] walked away with an exit and [I] gave the pieces to somebody, and now they did something with it... and it ended in the antithesis of what I had tried to build for 12 years.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The proximate cause was prosaic enough. Uvaro's &quot;<a href="https://betakit.com/bankruptcy-docs-claim-faltering-sales-pipeline-sunk-uvaro-and-lighthouse-labs-post-acquisition/">forecasted sales pipeline and government contract awards didn't come to fruition within its predicted timeline</a>.&quot; Companies run out of cash. It happens.</p><p>The end of Lighthouse Labs was not an isolated failure. It was a canary in the coal mine.</p><h2 id="the-great-bootcamp-die-off" tabindex="-1">The Great Bootcamp Die-Off <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-great-bootcamp-die-off" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>In the past few years, <a href="https://bluewavelabs.ca/are-coding-bootcamps-on-life-support-examining-the-north-american-shutdown-wave/">a dozen prominent North American coding bootcamps shut down</a>. San Antonio's Codeup suddenly ceased operations in late December 2023. Indianapolis-based Kenzie Academy stopped accepting new enrollees. Raleigh's <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2024/04/01/triangle-coding-bootcamp-momentum-closes-citing-ai">Momentum Learning cited the rise of AI</a> when it closed after six years and over 400 graduates. California's Rithm School halted applications. Massachusetts's Launch Academy paused its immersive program. Oregon's Epicodus, Washington's Code Fellows, and Toronto's Juno College of Technology all followed suit.</p><p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/tech-innovation/teaching-learning/2025/01/09/changes-boot-camp-marks-signal-shifts-workforce">Southern New Hampshire University</a> shut down its coding bootcamp in 2023, citing &quot;low-cost competition and the broad adoption of AI tools.&quot; <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/2025-year-in-review-coding-bootcamp-news">Women Who Code shuttered</a>, citing lack of funding. Viking Code School, Telegraph Academy, Orange Code School, Alchemy Code Lab.</p><p>A roll-call of closures reading like an obituary page.</p><p>In December 2024, 2U, the online program management giant that had partnered with over 50 universities to run coding bootcamps, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/tech-innovation/teaching-learning/2025/01/09/changes-boot-camp-marks-signal-shifts-workforce">announced it was exiting the bootcamp sector entirely</a>. No selling the business or exiting. Shutting it down. Their $750 million investment held, as one education sector banker noted, &quot;little or no market value.&quot; The business line wasn't even worth selling.</p><p>The economics here are brutal. Bootcamps were thriving in the 2010's, and it made sense. You pay a mere twenty grand, study for four months, and suddenly you're landing a job that pays a salary of $70,000/year. Of course enrollment exploded. At its peak in 2017 there were over 90 full-time bootcamps operating in the United States and Canada. The industry was unstoppable.</p><p>Except it wasn't, at all. There was a fragility baked-in to the model. Bootcamps relied heavily on government subsidies and corporate partnerships.</p><p>When Lighthouse Labs received <a href="https://www.bctechnology.com/news/2025/8/8/Canada-Wide-Technical-Training-Firm-Lighthouse-Labs-(and-Acquiring-Company-Uvaro)-File-for-Bankruptcy.cfm">$21.2 million from the Canadian government</a> in February 2023, it was really a lifeline. Many students paid little or nothing out of pocket since governments covered the bill.</p><p>Then, the funding dried up. Without subsidies, the full $15,000-$20,000 sticker price became the burden of the students. Enrollment collapsed. Bootcamps hemorrhaged cash. And the jobs those graduates were supposed to land? Oh yeah, those were vanishing, too.</p><h2 id="vibe-coding" tabindex="-1">Vibe Coding <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#vibe-coding" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>In a glowing 2023 anniversary interview, Khurram Virani, Lighthouse Labs' co-founder and Head of Technology, acknowledged AI's impact but remained optimistic.</p><p>&quot;<a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/10-years-of-lighthouse-labs-lessons-learned">Makers and technologists will be able to build more amazing things faster by leveraging generative AI</a>,&quot; he said. &quot;It's an exciting time.&quot;</p><p>Do you think it was an exciting time, reader?</p><p>Coined by AI expert Andrej Karpathy, vibe coding described the use of AI tools to handle the heavy lifting of code generation, while the &quot;developer&quot; processes things with natural, English language. Tools like <a href="https://medium.com/@niall.mcnulty/vibe-coding-b79a6d3f0caa">Cursor</a>, Replit, and Windsurf let anyone—designers, product managers, even complete non-coders—build (seemingly) functional applications by describing what they wanted.</p><p>Replit's CEO noted that <a href="https://medium.com/@niall.mcnulty/vibe-coding-b79a6d3f0caa">75% of Replit customers never write a single line of code</a>. They describe what they want, and the AI generates it.</p><p>The &quot;grunt work&quot; once served as training ground for junior developers—writing boilerplate code, setting up APIs, debugging basic syntax errors. That was all automated, now. The entry-level ladder was collapsing.</p><p>Daniel Pianko, managing director of Achieve, an education-focused private equity firm, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/tech-innovation/teaching-learning/2025/01/09/changes-boot-camp-marks-signal-shifts-workforce">put it bluntly</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Ten years ago, employers wanted people who could convert business practices into programming languages. But in 2025, AI-powered machines can do much of that programming, which has elevated demand for higher-level workers who have an understanding of the specific business problems you want to solve rather than specific coding skills.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Coding bootcamps taught JavaScript fundamentals, React components, and REST APIs. This is what AI-only coding could now replicate. Not perfectly, but well enough.</p><p>AI never asked for benefits and never called in sick. A compliant, obedient servant.</p><h2 id="an-entry-level-apocalypse" tabindex="-1">An Entry-Level Apocalypse <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#an-entry-level-apocalypse" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/12/26/ai-vs-gen-z/">Stanford Digital Economy Lab analysis</a>, U.S. entry-level tech job postings dropped 67% between 2023 and 2024. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-effect-entry-level-jobs">Entry-level hiring at the 15 biggest tech firms fell 25%</a> from 2023 to 2024.</p><p>Google and Meta are <a href="https://codeconductor.ai/blog/future-of-junior-developers-ai/">hiring roughly 50% fewer new grads</a> compared to 2021. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff <a href="https://codeconductor.ai/blog/future-of-junior-developers-ai/">announced the company would hire no new software engineers in 2025</a>, citing AI-driven productivity gains.</p><p><a href="https://codeconductor.ai/blog/future-of-junior-developers-ai/">Job listings for software developers are down approximately 70% from their 2022 peak</a>, according to Indeed data. Computer science graduates face a <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/12/26/ai-vs-gen-z/">6% unemployment rate</a>, while computer engineers are at 7.5% which is nearly <em>double</em> the general unemployment rate.</p><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-effect-entry-level-jobs">Programmer employment fell 27% between 2023 and 2025</a>, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Internship postings on Handshake, a recruitment platform, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/12/26/ai-vs-gen-z/">dropped 30% for tech roles since 2023</a>.</p><p>And <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/12/26/ai-vs-gen-z/">70% of hiring managers surveyed said they believe AI can do the jobs of interns</a>, and 57% said they trust AI's work more than that of interns or recent grads.</p><p>If you are a junior developer in 2025, you were now competing with not just other jr. devs, but GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude Sonnet.</p><p>Bootcamp graduates had invested months of their lives and thousands of dollars to acquire skills that employers no longer valued. Reddit threads filled with despair. &quot;<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/tech-innovation/teaching-learning/2025/01/09/changes-boot-camp-marks-signal-shifts-workforce">Bootcamps will not get you a job right now. Stop asking</a>,&quot; read one popular post.</p><p>A student named Tim Lum, featured on an <a href="https://www.jackimwoods.com/the-future-of-coding-bootcamps-how-ai-is-reshaping-the-market/">EdSurge podcast</a>, described haphazard classroom environments with widely varying skill levels. Students essentially taught themselves using the bootcamp's curriculum. He ultimately decided a traditional computer science degree was necessary, and enrolled in community college.</p><p>It's a cruel irony that bootcamp students had often come from dying industries, themselves. Oil workers laid off in Calgary's downturn. Retail employees fleeing automation. Journalists watching newsrooms shutter.</p><p>They were told they could retrain and pivot into tech because that was a future-proof safe bet of a career.</p><h2 id="the-calgary-canary" tabindex="-1">The Calgary Canary <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-calgary-canary" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Two thousand kilometers from Vancouver, in a back-of-house space on Level 3 of <a href="https://www.calgarylibrary.ca/library-news/community-partner-brings-tech-training-to-libraries">Calgary's Central Library</a>, there's another coding bootcamp still operating.</p><p><a href="https://inceptionu.com/">InceptionU</a> had been born in 2017 from the same optimistic fervor as Lighthouse Labs. Three Calgary professionals—Margo Purcell, Jill Langer, and Greg Hart—witnessed the city's economy crater with oil prices and decided the narrative needed to change. They founded InceptionU (originally with the full-stack programmed called EvolveU) to retrain Albertans for the digital economy.</p><p>The &quot;Full Stack Developer&quot; bootcamp was a flagship six-month immersive course. Beyond just coding, InceptionU emphasized they taught &quot;MetaSkills like critical thinking, systems thinking, design thinking.&quot; Project-based learning with students building real applications for real clients.</p><p>There was funding from the Hunter Family Foundation, and later the <a href="https://www.inceptionu.com/blog/inceptionu-origin-story">Alberta government</a> covered most tuition costs. Over <a href="https://www.inceptionu.com/blog/inceptionu-origin-story">230 learners completed the program</a>; most found employment in Calgary's growing tech sector.</p><p>For over a dozen consecutive cohorts, InceptionU ran back-to-back. Every few months, a new class began learning JavaScript, React, Flask, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. They debugged together, built together, celebrated together.</p><p>I would know because I was a member of <a href="https://brennan-evolveu.netlify.app/">Cohort 4 in 2020</a>.</p><p>Then, in the past few months, the government funding ended.</p><p>InceptionU's Full Stack Developer program cost $19,000 out of pocket. In a city <em>still</em> reeling from oil industry contraction, in an economy where tech jobs are now evaporating, that price is prohibitive.</p><p>Instead of naming a fixed starting date, <a href="https://inceptionu.com/individuals/full-stack-developer-program">InceptionU's website</a> now simply says the next cohort is &quot;coming soon&quot;.</p><p>In January 2026, InceptionU's leadership sent an email to alumni. A 90% discount on new short courses. &quot;AI in the Wild&quot; (18 hours, normally $2,900, now $290) and &quot;Cybersecurity Launchpad&quot; (18 hours, normally $1,099, now $109.90). Limited seats. First-come, first-served. It was, in the parlance of dying industries, a liquidation sale.</p><h2 id="what-we-lost" tabindex="-1">What We Lost <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#what-we-lost" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>It's too easy to dismiss coding bootcamps as simply part of the larger collapse of Silicon Valley's unicorn ventures. For a decade there was a rapid, accelerating demand for software developers as hundreds of companies were raising millions. You know these companies. Uber. AirBnB, Slack, Pinterest. <a href="https://www.fullstackeconomics.com/p/the-end-of-silicon-valleys-20-year">Where do they stand, now?</a></p><p>I think this narrative is too neat and tidy, though, actually.</p><p>At their best, bootcamps democratized access to tech. People overlooked by traditional compsci were recruited. The mid-career professionals, the parents returning to work, the people without the time or money for four-year degrees. A lot were immigrants or newcomers, I saw that first-hand myself. There was a community proving programming was actually not exclusive to 22-year-olds with Stanford degrees.</p><p>Lighthouse Labs' 40,000 graduates include people who rebuilt their lives. Oil workers who became full-stack developers. Teachers who pivoted to data analytics. Single mothers who found flexibility and dignity in remote work.</p><p>These were not grifts. These were real transformations.</p><p>The instructors were experienced developers who loved teaching and believed in mentorship. They lost their livelihoods, as well. When Uvaro and Lighthouse Labs filed for bankruptcy, every employee was terminated immediately. Years of curriculum development, pedagogical innovation, relationship-building with employers. All vaporized.</p><h2 id="the-future-that-isnt-coming" tabindex="-1">The Future That Isn't Coming <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-future-that-isnt-coming" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>There are, of course, optimists. AWS CEO Matt Garman <a href="https://codeconductor.ai/blog/future-of-junior-developers-ai/">argues that juniors are affordable, quick to adopt AI tools, and essential for long-term growth</a>. Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke <a href="https://codeconductor.ai/blog/future-of-junior-developers-ai/">calls fears of junior developer obsolescence &quot;overblown&quot;</a>, noting that juniors bring fresh thinking and diverse backgrounds.</p><p>Google's Sundar Pichai <a href="https://codeconductor.ai/blog/future-of-junior-developers-ai/">sees AI as a productivity booster</a>, not a replacement, and says Google will hire <em>more</em> engineers in 2025 because AI-powered productivity lets them do more with the same workforce.</p><p>I think it's a pipe dream to think this is merely a painful transition and not an ending.</p><p>People are now sending out hundreds of applications and getting automated rejections. People are now competing for roles that expect &quot;3-5 years of experience&quot; for &quot;entry-level&quot; positions. People are now watching LinkedIn posts where senior developers complain about burnout while companies refuse to hire juniors.</p><p><a href="https://byteiota.com/junior-developer-extinction-67-hiring-collapse-explained/">Companies are foolishly optimizing</a> for short-term cost savings by refusing to train the next generation. There is going to be a catastrophic leadership vacuum in the next five years.</p><h2 id="eulogy" tabindex="-1">Eulogy <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#eulogy" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>When Lighthouse Labs filed for bankruptcy, I think an era ended.</p><p>Whiteboards covered in JavaScript. Midnight debugging sessions and stale coffee, leading to demo days of nervous students presenting capstone projects to future employers. Slack channels buzzing with job leads and code reviews and meme .GIFs and inside jokes. Of a future and a possibility that technology could save us.</p><p>That era is over.</p><p>Rest in peace, Lighthouse Labs. You lit the way for 40,000 people. The darkness that follows your extinguishing is deeper than you knew.</p><hr /><p><em>Disclosure: The author was a member of InceptionU Cohort 4 in 2020.

    <description>What is the meaning of life? Is there more than one correct answer? I&#39;ve decided to take a rather long-winded exploration of how different cultures approach the sacred, the dead, and the transcendent, suggesting that multiple paths can lead to the same fundamental truths.</description>

But while the expression is unnecessarily violent, by the time you finish this essay, you'll understand why I think the sentiment behind it is incredibly important.</p><h2 id="prologue-an-odd-expression" tabindex="-1">Prologue: An Odd Expression <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#prologue-an-odd-expression" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><a href="https://grammarphobia.com/blog/2021/08/skin-a-cat.html">The earliest version of the phrase appears in 1678</a> in John Ray's collection of English proverbs, the equally horrible-and-bizarre &quot;there are more ways to kill a dog than hanging.&quot; By the early 1700s, the British were saying <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/there-is-more-than-one-way-to-skin-a-cat.html">&quot;there are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream,&quot;</a> a delightfully absurd image if you think about it, as if choking a cat with dairy were the default method anyone would consider. The modern American version <a href="https://grammarist.com/phrase/more-than-one-way-to-skin-a-cat/">first appeared in print around 1840</a> in Seba Smith's &quot;The Money Diggers,&quot; where he wrote</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This is a money digging world of ours; and, as it is said, 'there are more ways than one to skin a cat,' so are there more ways than one of digging for money.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Smith wrote as though everyone already knew the phrase. <a href="https://www.worldwidewords.org/qa-mor1.html">Mark Twain used it in 1889</a> in <em>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;She was wise, subtle, and knew more than one way to skin a cat&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Meaning she knew multiple strategies to get what she wanted. Some optimistically claim the &quot;cat&quot; is actually short for catfish, which must be skinned before cooking since they lack scales. But the <a href="https://grammarphobia.com/blog/2021/08/skin-a-cat.html">phrase's evolution from dogs to cats, from hanging to choking to skinning</a>, suggests this is regional reinterpretation of a much older proverbial pattern.</p><p><a href="https://proverbs_en_uk.en-academic.com/3573/there_are_more_ways_of_killing_a_dog_than_by_hanging">Before cats entered the picture at all</a>, the English said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;There are more ways to the wood than one.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>A gentler metaphor about reaching a destination via different paths. That isn't what stuck, though. Somewhere along the way, we traded walking peacefully to the forest for the visceral, violent image of removing an animal's pelt.</p><p>The violence makes it memorable. Makes us wince. The discomfort is why the saying has endured.</p><p>We are forced to reckon with the fact that solutions to problems, even when they achieve the same end, can look radically, disturbingly different from one another.</p><p>I invoke this phrase now, despite its grimness, because I am trying to articulate what has been gnawing at me. How we live in a world demanding singular answers. One right way, one true path, one correct interpretation. But this expression suggests the opposite.</p><p>There are profound truths we all reach for, but we reach in such different ways, we kill and wage war with one another over this. The conclusions we come to are not only incorrect, but will damn us eternally.</p><p>I believe the opposite. The multiplicity doesn't diminish the truth; it confirms it.</p><p>Multiple ritual and moral languages may be different ways of touching the same 'more-than-material' reality (or at least the same human recognition of meaning). There are things we cannot prove, but universally recognize. The materialist explanation for human behaviours: the reduction of love to oxytocin, how grief to neural firing patterns, how the sacred to adaptive evolutionary behaviour. Both true and utterly insufficient.</p><p>Different paths can lead to the same human end—if the end is earnest, and pursued in good faith And what I'm trying to say is this: maybe the goal we're all reaching for, across every culture and century, is to acknowledge that the material world is not all there is. We are surrounded by mystery. Something beyond the measurable shapes everything we are.</p><p>And there are more ways than one to reach toward that mystery correctly.</p><h2 id="part-one-beauty-of-the-dead-and-rituals" tabindex="-1">Part One: Beauty of the Dead and Rituals <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#part-one-beauty-of-the-dead-and-rituals" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>There are more ways than one to respect the dead.</p><figure><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5771/30675124431_16b7d03331_c.jpg" alt="The well clad ancestors by Collin Key, on Flickr" /><figcaption>The well clad ancestors by Collin Key, on Flickr.

Here, death is not a single moment but a slow unfurling across days, weeks, years. Families practice funeral ceremonies lasting 3-10 days where deceased members are kept at home, dressed, given food. For they are not dead until buried properly. The journey to Puya is gradual, the afterlife waiting beyond the mountains. The air fills with the sound of drums and the bellowing of water buffaloes, sometimes fifty, sometimes a hundred, whose sacrifice marks the status of the departed.</p><p>Every few years comes <a href="https://authentic-indonesia.com/blog/5-sacred-and-unique-funeral-traditions-in-toraja/">Ma'nene</a>, when families climb to ancient cliff-face vaults, bring down their ancestors, wash their bones, dress them in fresh silk and batik, brush their hair.

Families descend on ancestral tombs with bands playing salegy music, horns bright in the tropical air. Crypts are opened, unwrapping the bundled dead from old shrouds. Handling bones that have been slowly giving back to earth with grace. Fresh silk, handwoven and perfumed, are wrapped around each ancestor while families dance, lifting bodies above their heads, circling the tomb seven times.</p><p>The Malagasy believe the dead appreciate celebration and joy. Remembering the music they once danced to. Spirits don't ascend to join ancestors until fully decomposed, and until then, they deserve parties. Expecting women take fragments of ancestral shrouds, believing the blessing of the dead can quicken new life.</p><figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/JazzFuneralWratten.jpg" alt="Musicians of 'Algiers Brass Band' at 'jazz funeral', New Orleans" /><figcaption>Musicians of "Algiers Brass Band" at a jazz funeral in New Orleans. 1980's or 1990's. | <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JazzFuneralWratten.jpg">source</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/ghana-fantasy-coffins/">In Ghana</a>, master carpenters build fantasy coffins shaped like Mercedes-Benzes for businessmen, oversized fish for fishermen, enormous Bibles for the devout—believing the dead continue their professions in the afterlife, buried to honour their earthly work. <a href="https://nga.gov.au/first-nations/the-aboriginal-memorial/burial-ceremonies/">In Aboriginal Australia</a>, bodies are placed on tall platforms covered in leaves and left for months to decompose, the spirit returning to the land before being reborn. <a href="https://64parishes.org/entry/jazz-funerals-and-second-line-parades">In New Orleans</a>, jazz bands lead funeral processions, playing dirges until the dead are buried, then shifting to jubilant music, dancing through the streets to celebrate the life that was lived.</p><hr /><p>And so I ask, is only one tradition correct? A single path to salvation? That seems like such a narrow and ridiculous question to ask. It is perhaps more logical to say, simply, <em>none</em> of them are correct. That none of this is actually respecting the dead because there is no actual way for us to communicate with those who have died, and that all we have is this one finite, brief, and absurd life.</p><p>This thinking can be applied to a lot of things, can't it? It is easy to succumb to this conclusion and to perceive the universe as cold and mechanical, and that there is no meaning or purpose for any particular thing, and that it is all for naught.</p><h2 id="part-two-our-inherent-nature" tabindex="-1">Part Two: Our Inherent Nature <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#part-two-our-inherent-nature" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5902524/">Babies born blind smile</a>.

Colours change throughout the day. Yellow, orange, red, and pink in the morning as the sun rises, grey at midday, then pink and red again, finally orange and yellow as the sun descends. When conditions align at sunset, <a href="https://traveltalesoflife.com/chinook-winds-calgary/">the sun's rays illuminate the underside of the arch</a>, and the entire sky ignites. <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/calgary-sunset-combined-with-chinook-arch-sets-the-sky-on-fire_n_4350890">Shades of red, pink, and orange</a> bleeding across hundreds of kilometers of clouds. The sight stops people mid-stride on frozen sidewalks, makes them pull their cars to the shoulder, stand transfixed as the heavens burn. Something in us recognizes this as beautiful and meaningful, without anyone teaching us to feel this way.</p><p>We find beauty in things. We fall in love with people and the sky above us.</p><hr /><p>Inversely, there is a universal recognition of horror and immoral atrocity.</p><p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1368431002005001001">After the Holocaust</a>, the world struggled to establish universal moral criteria, standards for right and wrong that could prevent such atrocities from recurring. <a href="https://lewwaller.com/morality-and-altruism-after-the-holocaust/">Philosopher Zygmunt Bauman argued</a> that the Holocaust proves societal rules and norms cannot be the only source of morality. Perpetrators argued in court they were only following the laws of their country. How can we judge them if morals are products of relative social context? <a href="https://lewwaller.com/morality-and-altruism-after-the-holocaust/">Bauman proposed</a> instead that morality originates in a fundamental responsibility to another person in proximity. Unconditional, preceding knowledge, language, culture, and norms. When rescuers during the Holocaust <a href="https://lewwaller.com/morality-and-altruism-after-the-holocaust/">encountered someone in need</a>, someone who needed a hiding place, food, false documents, many described feeling they had no choice, that they <em>had</em> to act. &quot;What else could I do?&quot; they asked. This is not learned. This was something deeper.</p><p>We have an innate ability to recognize a morality that is not wholly subjective nor relative.</p><p>Even if evolution explains the mechanism, it doesn't settle the question of meaning or why these experiences feel like more than just biology. The fact that our brains are wired for certain responses doesn't eliminate the mystery of why those responses exist at all, or why they carry the weight of significance they do.</p><h2 id="part-three-the-foundation" tabindex="-1">Part Three: The Foundation <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#part-three-the-foundation" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>And these are the simple facts of which we must build a foundation of understanding: that there is perhaps a meaning that is not derived from the naïve, coping philosopher who is desperately trying to point to something to distract himself from oblivion.</p><p>Instead, rather, there is something beyond the material and beyond what we can actually observe with any sort of sensory instruments. And I do not think of this as pointing to any particular religion, but it is perhaps something extranatural.</p><p>Maybe I am just repeating sentiments that have already been declared, such as <em>&quot;all roads lead to God&quot;</em> and that there is a universalism within our spirituality. There is truth to that, but it is not precise to what I am trying to articulate here.</p><p>What I am saying here, rather, is that there's more than one way to skin a cat.</p><p>We do not know the exact rules for this universe that we were spontaneously born into. We do not know the laws of our physical being. But we do know how to love, and we do know how to take care of one another, and we know how to forge community, and we know how to exist, and we know how to grow medicine. and we know how to heal other living things. Just to give an example of the wide range of the spectrum of our competency and knowledge.</p><p>And from this spectrum arise our perplexing habits that we separate from the profane and declare sacred, and that are most often times so intricate and colourful and woven with rare and highly valuable objects, where we recite beautiful poetry in languages that we have long forgotten.</p><p>And the anthropologist truly can give a rational explanation for these habits that is satisfactory to the materialist, who does not subscribe to a world beyond the world we know.</p><h2 id="part-four-the-anthropologists-predicament" tabindex="-1">Part Four: The Anthropologist's Predicament <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#part-four-the-anthropologists-predicament" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Not to single out a particular field, but when looking at how humanity has reckoned with our greatest questions, the anthropologist has an answer for everything. <a href="https://jamesbishopblog.com/2020/02/08/clifford-geertz-religion-as-a-system-of-symbols/">Clifford Geertz</a>, who spent years living among the Javanese and Balinese, who documented their rituals with meticulous care, <a href="http://hypergeertz.jku.at/GeertzTexts/Religion_System.htm">defined religion as</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;A system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>He argued that <a href="https://nideffer.net/classes/GCT_RPI_S14/readings/Geertz_Religon_as_a_Cultural_System_.pdf">in ritual</a>, the world as lived and the world as imagined fuse together under symbolic forms, producing a transformation in one's sense of reality. <a href="https://egyankosh.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/27552/1/Unit-13.pdf">Sacred symbols</a>, he observed, provide blueprints for social existence, shaping the quality of human experience by inducing states transcending ordinary awareness.</p><p><a href="https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-anthropology-of-victor-turner-ritual-liminality-and-cultural-performance/">Victor Turner</a>, who lived with the Ndembu people of Zambia, introduced the concept of <a href="https://www.bookey.app/book/the-ritual-process">liminality</a>. Turner thought of the threshold space in ritual where participants are &quot;betwixt and between,&quot; stripped of their usual social identities, existing in a state of ambiguity and potentiality. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14634996241282143">In these liminal phases</a>, Turner argued, people experience <em>communitas</em>, defined as a spontaneous sense of connection and co-humanity which both violate and transcend typical hierarchies. <a href="https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-anthropology-of-victor-turner-ritual-liminality-and-cultural-performance/">Ritual serves to challenge and transform</a> social norms through sacred transgression, carving out new space.</p><p>For the anthropologist, when the Malagasy dance with their exhumed ancestors they are reinforcing kinship bonds and maintaining social continuity across generations. When Tibetan monks perform sky burials, they're enacting Buddhist beliefs about the impermanence of the body and the continuation of consciousness. When Catholics recite Latin prayers over ash, they're participating in a 2,000-year-old symbolic system that structures relationship to suffering, mortality, and the divine.</p><p><a href="https://oer.pressbooks.pub/beliefs/chapter/rituals/">The anthropologist documents</a>. Rituals embody worldviews, the sacred is an altered state of consciousness. Our traditions are transitions between social statuses. Synchronized ritual movements <a href="https://rai.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.14048">trigger neurobiological responses</a> promoting social bonding. And emotionally intense rituals create indelible episodic memories which then become part of participants' essential autobiographical selves.</p><p>The evolutionary advantages of ritual behaviour are easily traced. The adaptive benefits of group cohesion are explained through the biochemistry of shared transcendent experience. Every gesture has a function. Every symbol serves a purpose. Everything can be catalogued, analyzed, understood.</p><p>Hm, what does this anthropologist think of sunsets and their parents' funeral?</p><p>What happens when the anthropologist goes home for the holidays and sits at the table where their grandmother used to sit, now empty? When they light the candles on their own child's birthday cake? When they stand at their father's grave and cannot speak?</p><hr /><figure><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/3203/3066842867_211ca06332_c.jpg" alt="Banaue, Ifugao Village Elders, Philippines 1985" /><figcaption>Banaue, Ifugao Village Elders, Philippines 1985 by CanadaGood Gregory Melle, on Flickr. | <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/canadagood/3066842867">source</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Courses/Lumen_Learning/Book:_Cultural_Anthropology_(Lumen)/3:_Module_1/3.6:_Chapter_2:_Doing_Fieldwork:_Methods_in_Cultural_Anthropology">In 1981</a>, anthropologist Renato Rosaldo and his wife Michelle were conducting fieldwork with the Ilongot of Northern Luzon in the Philippines. For years, Rosaldo tried to understand the Ilongot practice of headhunting, a cultural tradition where men would kill enemies and take their heads after experiencing a significant loss, like the death of a loved one. Ilongots explained grief created an overwhelming rage in the heart, a weight which could only be lifted by literally taking another's head. Rosaldo listened, took notes, analyzed the practice through theoretical frameworks. Structural, symbolic, psychoanalytic. But he could not <em>understand</em>. He could not grasp the emotional force driving someone to such an act.</p><p>Then, Michelle Rosaldo fell to her death during their fieldwork. She slipped from a cliff edge, sixty-five feet down onto rocks below. She died instantly.</p><p><a href="https://pressbooks.pub/perspectives/chapter/doing-fieldwork-methods-in-cultural-anthropology/">Only through this devastating personal experience</a>---the overwhelming and otherworldly rage arriving with sudden, meaningless loss---did Rosaldo finally understand the headhunters. Not intellectually. Not theoretically. But within his body, and in his bones. In a howling void where his wife used to be. The rancour and rage of grief was no longer abstract and in theory. It wasn't data. There was only fire and suffocation. The world became meaningless and needing—<em>needing</em>—a violent release just to survive the next hour.</p><p>The result was influential ethnographic account, sure. But it was also an acknowledgment of the limits of detached observation. <a href="https://oer.pressbooks.pub/representations/chapter/ethnographic-research-methods/">Ethnographers keep personal journals</a> of emotions during fieldwork, recognizing their own humanity and personal responses are not separate from research, but integral to it. <a href="https://pressbooks.openeducationalberta.ca/anth/chapter/doing-fieldwork-methods-in-cultural-anthropology/">Ethnography is not an objective science</a>. There is no objective science. Everything researchers experience in the field is filtered through their personal humanity.</p><p>And so, I think about the anthropologist and the cynical nihilist. Do they get along? Are they roommates?</p><p>Perhaps they are. Perhaps the anthropologist explains to the nihilist how all rituals are adaptive behaviors and social constructs serving evolutionary functions. How the sense of the sacred is simply how our pattern-seeking brains interpret synchronized group activities. That grief is mere neurochemistry, love is mere oxytocin and dopamine, and transcendence is merely the prefrontal cortex going quiet.</p><p>And the nihilist nods, satisfied. <em>Yes. Exactly! Just mechanisms. Just meat and electricity. Nothing more.</em> But, then, what leads them to get out of bed every day?</p><p>Surely, the answer cannot simply be to work to pay for a roof over their head? A declaration that we must simply work for livelihood to sustain ourselves, and to exist for the sake of its own existence? It is a ridiculous circular logic.</p><p>The anthropologist, perhaps more than most, has stood in sacred space. She's participated in a ritual not as impartial neutral observer, but as a mourner and celebrant. As human being marked by transition. Feeling her throat tighten when the bell rings or the incense curls or the prayer begins. She's discovered, despite years of training in cultural relativism and symbolic analysis, that some things <em>feel</em> different even when they shouldn't, even when there's no rational reason they should.</p><p><a href="https://www.studocu.com/en-us/document/washington-university-in-st-louis/introduction-to-cultural-anthropology/ritual-and-religion/6394911">Geertz himself acknowledged</a> people do not live in the world of religious symbols all the time. Most live in it only at moments. The everyday world of practical acts is paramount. But in those moments when ritual draws us in, when we're caught in what Turner called the liminal space between states, something happens that analysis cannot fully capture.</p><p>The anthropologist explains <em>why</em> rituals create meaning and <em>how</em> they function. But when their own mother dies, when they stand at the graveside and the rabbi recites Kaddish or the priest says the final blessing or the rainset family pours Holy Water over the body wrapped in white cloth, the categorical difference between &quot;interesting cultural practice&quot; and &quot;this is my mother, this is unbearable, feelings-beyond-words are all I have&quot; collapses. It has always been collapsed.</p><p>What does the anthropologist think when asked to come home for the holidays? Is the symbolic significance of the family gathering analyzed? Or the ritual exchange of gifts and repeated narratives at the dinner table? Or do they just... go home? Because it is home.</p><p>What does the anthropologist think when she leans in for a kiss for the first time? The pair-bonding strategies and oxytocin release? Or is the chest hammering as the world narrows to a single point of contact.

Like seeing disturbances in a tranquil pond and to never glimpse what caused them.</p><p>Perhaps our rituals are ripples. Our inexplicable sense of the sacred are ripples. Our innate recognition of beauty and horror, perhaps these too, are ripples. Evidence of something totally unobservable yet shaping everything.</p><p>The materialist can catalogue every neuron firing when we witness injustice, every hormone released when we love, and can explain the evolutionary advantages of cooperation and the biochemistry of grief. The anthropologist, too, knows all this. Has written papers about it. Has published books analyzing how different cultures construct meaning from the raw ore and material of human experience.</p><p>But the fact that we can describe <em>how</em> a sunset scatters light through atmospheric particles doesn't stop the way it stops our breath.

The ordinary matter making up our bodies, our world, and everything we touch and taste and smell is <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/universe/overview/building-blocks/">5% of existence</a>. We will always be the rare exception, the strange bright things drifting through an invisible sea.</p><p>And somehow, across this vast darkness, separated by culture and language and centuries and mountain ranges, we have all independently decided certain things are sacred. Death deserves ceremony. Love matters. Beauty means something.</p><p>We all sense <em>something</em> beyond the material, we all create rituals to try to honour the liminal spaces where life touches death, we all recognize the difference between right and wrong even when it contradicts our culture's rules, we all stop to watch the sky burn orange and pink above the mountains even when we're late, even when we're cold, even when it makes no practical sense—</p><p>Maybe the consensus across every human society that has ever existed is itself the evidence. Not proof. But evidence. A ripple in the pond. The 95% of reality we cannot see, making itself known through what it does to us.</p><p>There is more than one way to honour the dead, to mark the sacred, to reach toward the transcendent. The Malagasy dance with their ancestors. The Tibetans return bodies to the sky. The Catholics recite Latin over ash. The Jews sit shiva. The Muslims turn toward Mecca. The Buddhists light incense. The Indigenous Peoples of countless traditions have countless ways of acknowledging that the material world is not the only world.</p><p>Perhaps they're all correct. There is something beyond what we can measure. The darkness is not empty. We are surrounded by mystery, and our rituals are how we mark its presence and honour what we cannot know, but still somehow recognize.</p><h2 id="conclusion-the-art-of-reaching" tabindex="-1">Conclusion: The Art of Reaching <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#conclusion-the-art-of-reaching" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>More than one way to skin a cat. More than one way to reach the unreachable.</p><p>We live immersed in what we cannot comprehend, and still we insist on meaning. Still we create beauty. Still we recognize injustice. Still we love. Still we gather to mark the sacred transitions, acknowledging that birth and death and transformation mean <em>something</em>, even if we don't know the exactitude of the what.</p><p>The universal human insistence across every culture that has ever lived declares we are more than matter in motion. Perhaps the insistence is, itself, the evidence we seek. The ripple revealing the invisible stone. The bending of light around an unseeable mass.</p><p>Through dance or prayer or silence or song, our reaching is how we acknowledge we are small bright things in an infinite darkness, surrounded by mystery, part of something vast we will never fully understand. But we sense it. All of us. In every culture. In every time. We sense it, and we reach.</p><p>More than one way to reach. But the reaching? That is what we share. That is what we're capable of. Written into our very faces before we ever learn to see.</p>

    <description>I transformed a messy tag list into an organized alphabetical sections, and there were a surprising amount of gotchas I encountered along the way.</description>

After writing and importing so many posts, it ended up being seventy-five tags in a messy pile. You'd have to parse through the wall of hashtags like <code>#academic-writing</code>, <code>#accessibility</code>, <code>#ai</code>, <code>#blogging</code>, <code>#chronic-illness</code> all jumbled together without any rhyme or reason.</p><p>What I envisioned instead was something with form and function, with tags starting with the same letter being grouped together, and as a bonus, a navigation bar to jump to each letter. That sounds easy, right?</p><p>Famous last words. Instead, spend a good couple hours <s>being confused</s> learning about the limitations of Nunjucks templating and implementing JavaScript filters for Eleventy collections.</p><h2 id="a-simple-start" tabindex="-1">A Simple Start <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#a-simple-start" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>My first instinct was to modify the existing <code>tags.njk</code> template.

tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Nunjucks templates are great for simple logic, but complex data manipulation should be moved to JavaScript filters. The template engine has limitations around complex object iteration, and string manipulation can confuse the parser.</p><p>Data normalization matters. There was a disconnect between normalized tag names in collections and original tag names in posts. I needed to consider how the normalized data would be used in templates when building collections.</p><p>When things go wrong:</p><ol><li>Verify data sources (what's actually in the collections?)</li><li>Check transformations (are filters working?)</li><li>Simplify templates (remove complex logic)</li><li>Add incremental debug output</li></ol><p>Custom filters, unlike templates, are powerful. Eleventy's custom filter system is great for data manipulation. Moving logic from templates to JavaScript filters makes things more readable, has better debugging, and is more maintainable.</p><p>My <a href="https://brennan.day/tags">tags page</a> now groups 75 tags into 18 alphabetical sections, provides sticky navigation for quick jumping, and maintains the existing tag filtering functionality.</p><p>Simple-sounding features almost always leads to interesting technical challenges. At least I get a blog post out of them!</p>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Like the rest of the full <a href="https://omg.lol/">omg.lol suite</a>, I love <a href="https://status.lol/brennan">status.lol</a>. It's become my go-to place for quick thoughts, updates, and micro-posts around once a day. <em>And</em> there's also an <a href="https://api.omg.lol/">easy-to-use API</a> that I've <a href="https://dev.to/brennan/version-controlled-omglol-auto-syncing-your-indieweb-with-github-actions-22eh">used before</a>. So, what if they could be part of the broader decentralized web?</p><p>That's when I decided to set up a <a href="https://brennan.day/twtxt.txt">twtxt feed</a> that automatically syncs with my status.lol updates.</p><p>Now, before I begin getting into the technical details, you might be asking what twtxt even is in the first place? Good question. twtxt is a decentralised, minimalist microblogging service for hackers.</p><p>From their <a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt">GitHub README</a>:</p><blockquote><p>So you want to get some thoughts out on the internet in a convenient and slick way while also following the gibberish of others? Instead of signing up at a closed and/or regulated microblogging platform, getting your status updates out with twtxt is as easy as putting them in a publicly accessible text file. The URL pointing to this file is your identity, your account. twtxt then tracks these text files, like a feedreader, and builds your unique timeline out of them, depending on which files you track. The format is simple, human readable, and integrates well with UNIX command line utilities.</p></blockquote><p>tl;dr: twtxt is a CLI tool, as well as a format specification for self-hosted flat file based microblogging.</p><h2 id="syncing" tabindex="-1">Syncing <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#syncing" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Now, I post once on status.lol, and it automatically appears on <a href="https://social.lol/brennan">social.lol</a> where my IndieWeb friends follow me, my site, and <a href="https://brennan.day/twtxt.txt">twtxt.txt</a>.</p><p>No extra work!

    <description>Beyond tipping culture, there are meaningful ways to support independent creators that don&#39;t involve money. Here are eight of the best.</description>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>So, you walk into your favourite coffee shop for a simple vanilla latte. Then, the barista smiles warmly as they flip around an iPad with three glowing buttons: 15%, 20%, 25%. The numbers stare you down while a line of impatient customers forms behind you. You hit 20% on a $7 drink because pressing &quot;No Tip&quot; is admitting you're a bad person. Later, you grab some delicious takeout at that new place nearby, the iPad is spun around again. Then, you decide to get a haircut at the barber and there's <em>another</em> spinning iPad with a display of percentages.</p><p>Even at the self-serve frozen yogurt place where you literally did everything yourself.</p><p>I get it. Even the auto repair shop you walk into at this point asks the same thing: A tip. A little extra on top of the money you're already (over)spending.</p><p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2023/11/09/tipping-culture-in-america-public-sees-a-changed-landscape/">Around 72% of Americans say tipping is expected in more places today than it was five years ago</a>, a phenomenon dubbed <a href="https://www.pew.org/en/trust/archive/winter-2024/americas-new-tipping-culture">&quot;tipflation.&quot;</a> Digital payment systems changed tipping, with <a href="https://www.mightytravels.com/2024/07/the-evolving-landscape-of-tipping-culture-a-look-at-emerging-trends-in-2024/">research showing people tend to tip upwards of 11% more when using digital methods</a> compared to cash. And who uses cash, anymore? The expansion of businesses accepting tips has been dramatic, with <a href="https://www.aarp.org/money/personal-finance/navigate-tipping-culture-rules/">the percentage of specialty food stores like bakeries and coffee shops accepting tips increased significantly from 2019 to 2024</a>, and <a href="https://www.aarp.org/money/personal-finance/navigate-tipping-culture-rules/">specialty retailers seeing a 50% growth</a> in tip acceptance during that same period. We're now being prompted to tip at <a href="https://www.aarp.org/money/personal-finance/navigate-tipping-culture-rules/">airport newsstands, movie theater concession counters, and auto repair shops</a>, all places that never expected gratuity before.</p><p>And there are a dwindling amount of places we can go to where this isn't the case. Public libraries, of course. City parks where you can walk among trees without anybody asking for 25% of the oxygen you breathe. The quiet corner booth at your local bookstore where you can flip through magazines without a screen demanding tribute (you might be asked to buy the magazine, though). But don't get me wrong, you <em>should</em> absolutely be spending more time in those kind of places, but that doesn't address the root issue here.</p><p>One of these few-remaining places that's free is our screens. The Internet. The majority of us are not paying for anything online and get hours of doomscrolling entertainment in return. There are, of course, actual heavy costs to this beyond money. Our privacy, our data, our well-being, to name a few. (Anybody remember PRISM?) There's a reason why the saying &quot;if you're not paying, you're the product&quot; is so popular.</p><p>The way you can ensure you're <em>not</em> being monitored, sold, or that your experience online is going to be a victim of enshittification? It's the answer you don't want to hear: by paying money for it.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, &quot;enshittification&quot; is a term <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/https-pluralistic-net-2024-04-04-teach-me-how-to-shruggie-kagi-caaa88c221f2">coined by tech critic Cory Doctorow</a> to describe how platforms decay over time. <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/3341-enshittification">First, they're good to users; then they abuse users to serve business customers; finally, they extract all value for shareholders</a>, leaving behind the bare minimum to prevent total collapse (temporarily, at least). It's <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374619329/enshittification">specific policy choices made by powerful people</a> who ignore warnings about the consequences.</p><p>But this isn't totally true, is it? You are paying. Regularly. You probably have <em>plenty</em> of subscription-based services, and they increasingly suck. <a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2025/12/another-disney-price-hike-leaves-subscribers-canceling-their-plans-sb1/">Netflix raised prices again in early 2025</a>, with Standard now at $17.99/month and Premium at $24.99/month. <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/streaming-prices-2026-netflix-spotify-amazon-paramount-11186550">Disney+ decided to include ads in its cheaper tier and raised prices in October 2025</a>, the ad-supported plan jumping to $11.99/month (up $2) and the Premium no-ads plan to $18.99/month (up $3). <a href="https://variety.com/2026/digital/news/spotify-confirms-ice-recruitment-ads-are-no-longer-running-1236626243/">Spotify ran ICE recruitment ads</a> on its free tier, featuring <a href="https://djmag.com/news/spotify-defends-running-ice-recruitment-ads-about-dangerous-illegals-part-of-us-government">fear-mongering language about &quot;dangerous illegals&quot;</a> before finally ending the campaign in late 2025 (though <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2026/01/08/spotify-tap-dance-ice-ads-issue/">they've left the door open to running similar government recruitment ads in the future</a>). Things get shitty even when you do pay money.</p><p>But not everything. Only big tech. Only giant companies that are held hostage to their money-hungry CEOs or shareholders who demand raises to quarterly earnings by any means necessary.</p><p>When you support small, independent businesses and creators, it allows for good work to be continued to be made without people needing to resort to working for a company that's part of a massive umbrella corporation that's going to suck.</p><p>Medium, specifically, is still independent. <a href="https://www.library.illinois.edu/infosci/is-publications/civilian-publications/medium/">It's owned by A Medium Corporation</a>, which means it hasn't been bought or acquired or sunset into oblivion. As I've advocated for plenty in the past, I think the $5/month subscription on Medium for membership is well-worth it. You get access and help support tens of thousands of writers just by reading and engaging with their work.</p><p>I'm fortunate enough to be earning a steady income just from my paywalled articles alone. And even though I do think membership is worth it, I've actually started to offer my articles for free on my personal website, <a href="https://brennan.day/">🔆 brennan.day</a>.</p><p>I think you should support small, independent creators who make work you consume regularly. Whether that's musicians, writers, YouTubers, streamers, artists, or anything else.</p><p>And while I do have links to my Ko-fi and Patreon on my site, this article isn't about me asking for money. I'm lucky enough to not need to do that. What I am going to do, though, is list out ways you can support me (and any other small creator) in ways that don't include money but truly do go a long way:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Share our work!</strong> Spread the word, share my stuff on social media (Mastodon, Bluesky, LinkedIn). Recommend <a href="https://brennan.day/projects">my themes/tools</a> to friends, colleagues, or your dev community. Link to my projects from your blog, portfolio, or documentation. Write about your experience using my tools, if you do!</p></li><li><p><strong>Star or contribute!</strong> If you're more on the tech-side, favourite one of <a href="https://github.com/brennankbrown">my repositories</a>, open issues, or submit pull requests. Fork and experiment with my themes and tools. Help with documentation by correcting typos (which I make <em>a lot</em> of) or by adding examples.</p></li><li><p><strong>Refer a client!</strong> Introduce me to nonprofits, collectives, or indie creators that could use help from my web dev business, <a href="https://berryhouse.ca/">Berry House</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Join the community!</strong> Join <a href="https://discord.gg/4qdJecDNkt">our Discord</a> or subscribe to the free tier of my <a href="https://patreon.com/brennankbrown">Patreon</a>. Attend a <a href="https://writeclub.ca/">Write Club</a> meeting, if you're in Calgary.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaborate!</strong> I'd love to work on something with other creatives, guest posting, going on your podcast, working on projects together, whatever it looks like. If you're doing something cool and important, I'd love to give <em>you</em> a shout-out.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invite me to speak!</strong> I'd love to do any virtual talks (or talks based in Calgary) on the IndieWeb, Indigenous issues, the craft of writing, or anything else you think I'd be suited for.</p></li><li><p><strong>Give feedback!</strong> Suggest ideas or give me criticism. I love when people comment on my posts or sign my <a href="https://brennan.day/guestbook">guestbook</a>, or just <a href="mailto:mail@brennanbrown.ca">email me</a> any thoughts you have.</p></li><li><p><strong>Subscribe!</strong> Via RSS, or join the newsletter (Medium is currently the only place I have an active newsletter, I'll be using Buttondown later via RSS but right now it costs too much to justify).</p></li></ol><p>Look, I know you're tired of being asked for money everywhere you go. I'm not adding another rotating iPad tip screen to your life. But when you engage with independent work (whether that's leaving a comment, sharing an article, or just telling a friend about something you loved), you're participating in an economy valuing quality over quarterly earnings.</p><p>You're helping build an internet that doesn't need to surveillance-capitalism its way into profitability. The big platforms will keep enshittifying, because that's what they're designed to do. But small creators like me? We're just trying to make good work and connect with people who care about it.</p><p>That relationship doesn't require a transaction. It just requires you to show up.</p>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>It's been over half a decade since COVID-19 became a global pandemic. I still distinctly remember the headlines of the bizarre, worrying cases of <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/novel-human-virus-pneumonia-cases-linked-seafood-market-china-stir-concern">&quot;Wuhan pneumonia&quot;</a> in January of 2020, only a few months before the entire world would be shut down.</p><p>The world has moved on, hasn't it? The pandemic is in past tense. A shared, collective trauma. A wound to our zeitgeist now healing. Something that still has lasting damage to our children's education and social skills, sure—but nobody has to worry about &quot;getting&quot; COVID-19 anymore, no countries are shut down anymore.</p><p>Right?</p><p>There is a smaller, radically different reality where this simply isn't the case. There are a group of people who are trying to shake everyone else awake—urgently trying to inform us that COVID-19 is ongoing. That COVID-19 is an existential threat.</p><p>I want to listen to them.</p><hr /><h2 id="where-we-stand" tabindex="-1">Where We Stand <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#where-we-stand" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>As of mid-January 2026, <a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/covid-symptoms-2025-holiday-surge-rcna249681">COVID-19 infections are growing or likely growing in 31 states</a>. The Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative estimates there are <a href="https://www.pmc19.com/data/index.php">over 700,000 new daily infections in the U.S.</a>, with rapid increases expected through the end of January. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html">COVID-19 activity is low but increasing nationally</a>, following the predictable winter surge pattern occuring since 2020.</p><p>Globally, <a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/summary">test positivity rates reached 11% in May 2025</a>, levels not seen since July 2024. The virus continues to mutate, with new variants driving the majority of current cases. <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/covid-19-2026-experts-explain-expectations-11214879">New variants are expected to emerge</a>, potentially more immune evasive than their predecessors.</p><p>Yet as of January 2026, only <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html">16.7% of adults</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html">6.9% of children</a> have received the updated 2025-2026 COVID vaccine. Fewer than <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929">25% of Americans received boosters</a> in the 2024-2025 season, the lowest uptake since COVID vaccines became available, and half the influenza vaccine uptake during the same period. We have collectively decided that COVID is over.</p><p>The virus disagrees.</p><h2 id="the-long-haul" tabindex="-1">The Long Haul <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-long-haul" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>The numbers are staggering, but they don't capture what it means to live with long COVID.

Soon, she began experiencing unusual symptoms. Difficulty climbing stairs, frequent sinus infections, and noticeable cognitive changes. Years later, she still lives with the effects.</p><p>Or consider Kerstin, who before COVID was <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/my-story/living-with-long-covid-kerstin-sailer">&quot;a really normal healthy and fit person.&quot;</a> Now, she says, <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/my-story/living-with-long-covid-kerstin-sailer">&quot;I felt like a battery that never charges properly. It felt like something is fundamentally wrong, but no one can tell me what it is.&quot;</a> Simple tasks like unloading a dishwasher leave her breathless.

The debilitating symptoms like fatigue, inability to sit or stand for long periods have all never gone away. As she notes, <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/public-health/infectious-diseases/long-covid-2025-symptoms-diagnosis-post-covid-treatments-and">over a third of Americans have not even heard of long COVID</a>.

Current estimates suggest that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_COVID">6-7% of adults and about 1% of children</a> develop long COVID after infection, though these figures vary widely based on methodology and definitions.</p><p>A <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11741453/">comprehensive meta-analysis of 429 studies</a> found that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11741453/">36% of COVID-19 positive individuals develop long COVID</a>, with regional variation: 35% in Asia, 39% in Europe, 30% in North America, and 51% in South America. For those still experiencing symptoms 1-2 years post-infection, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11741453/">the pooled prevalence was 47%</a>.</p><p>The numbers are staggering, but they don't capture the human reality. Long COVID presents with <a href="https://news.aai.org/2025/02/27/long-covid-an-often-invisible-disability/">over 200 documented symptoms</a>, affecting nearly every organ system. And critically, for a subset of patients, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_COVID">symptoms are expected to be lifelong</a>.</p><p><a href="https://news.aai.org/2025/02/27/long-covid-an-often-invisible-disability/">Fewer than 8% of people with long COVID fully recover</a>.</p><h2 id="me-cfs" tabindex="-1">ME/CFS <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#me-cfs" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>For many, long COVID is <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/long-covid-mecfs-and-the-importance-of-studying-infection-associated-illnesses">Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)</a> by another name.</p><p>A <a href="https://recovercovid.org/news/recover-study-finds-covid-19-increases-risk-developing-mecfs">RECOVER study found that 4.5% of people who had COVID-19 met ME/CFS diagnostic criteria</a>, compared to just 0.6% of those who never had COVID.

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, chronic Lyme disease, mast cell activation syndrome. These are debilitating, life-altering diseases our current science does not fully understand.</p><p>There is no cure. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_COVID">As of 2025, there are no established effective treatments for long COVID</a>.</p><h2 id="the-economy" tabindex="-1">The Economy <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-economy" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Research estimates the <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/long-covid-keeps-people-out-of-work-and-hurts-the-economy">annual global economic cost of long COVID at $1 trillion</a> which is about 1% of global GDP.

Brookings estimated in 2022 that <a href="https://news.aai.org/2025/02/27/long-covid-an-often-invisible-disability/">4 million Americans were out of work due to long COVID</a>, a number that has likely grown since. <a href="https://news.aai.org/2025/02/27/long-covid-an-often-invisible-disability/">Two-thirds of those affected have seen their ability to work diminished</a>, with many forced to sacrifice social activities and essential tasks just to stay employed.</p><p>One study concluded that <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/long-covid-keeps-people-out-of-work-and-hurts-the-economy">symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection may have contributed to over 12.9 million individuals not returning to work within three months of infection</a>.

A comprehensive California study found that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7106e1.htm">always using a face mask or respirator in indoor public settings was associated with 56% lower odds of testing positive</a> for SARS-CoV-2.

I'm going to assume you're in the majority and answer no. Maybe you think the need of face-to-face interaction takes precedent over the medical good masks do. Maybe you have your own respiratory issues that make masking difficult. Maybe you see the fascist cowards of ICE and don't want to partake in the same masking they're doing. Maybe you don't have the money for a consistent N95 supply.</p><p>Maybe you're just tired. It's been so long, you think. Let me host events and run my errands like things are back to normal.</p><p>Things are not back to normal. You know this. And it may seem as though <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2026/1/4/we-just-witnessed-power-kidnapping-the-law">kidnapping the president</a> of a foreign country and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/carney-greenland-soldiers-trump-tariff-nato-denmark-9.7050621">threats of warfare to capture another</a> or <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/474842/ice-enforcement-operation-culture-violence-minneapolis-border">the detention and murder of people</a> in the United States by federal law enforcement would take precedent over an illness that we have been vaccinated against for years, now.</p><p>I understand this urge and instinct. There can only be so many spinning plates. We can only stretch and spread ourselves so thin until we are a transparent membrane, see-through with no solid inner.</p><h2 id="the-social-schism" tabindex="-1">The Social Schism <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-social-schism" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>So why aren't we using these tools? Pandemic fatigue, misinformation, political polarization, and psychological reactance.</p><p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7888611/">Network analyses of anti-mask attitudes</a> found that the central nodes are (1) beliefs that masks are ineffective, and (2) psychological reactance. These attitudes are linked to anti-vaccination views, beliefs that COVID's threat has been exaggerated, disregard for social distancing, and political conservatism.</p><p>As of December 2025, <a href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/2025-national-survey-on-respiratory-diseases/">Democrats (34%) were more likely than Republicans (20%) or Independents (19%) to have received an updated COVID-19 vaccine</a>. Political affiliation has become a better predictor of COVID precautions than actual risk.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00561-4">adherence to protective behaviors like masking declined after vaccines were rolled out, the Omicron variant became dominant, and mask mandates were dropped</a>. The public declared victory and went home, even as the virus continued to spread and disable.</p><h2 id="the-unknown" tabindex="-1">The Unknown <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-unknown" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Let me tell you something important: this is hubris. There is so much we do not know. Our own bodies and biology and neurology are still as unknown to us as dark energy or the ecosystems at the bottom of our oceans.</p><p>And, because of that lack of understanding, and because these illnesses predominantly afflict women, they are not treated with the same urgency or legitimacy as other afflictions.</p><h3 id="medical-gaslighting" tabindex="-1">Medical Gaslighting <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#medical-gaslighting" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p><a href="https://www.concussionalliance.org/blog/2022/5/20/medical-gaslighting-of-women-and-people-of-color">Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with a mental illness when their symptoms are actually consistent with heart disease</a>. People of color face similar dismissal. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11967095/">False beliefs entrenched in medical education</a>—like the persistent myth that Black people's skin is thicker—lead to Black patients <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11967095/">being assigned lower pain scores and not receiving appropriate treatment</a> compared to their white counterparts.</p><p>In the context of long COVID specifically, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2025.1641411/full">many participants reported their symptoms were dismissed or misattributed to mental health conditions</a>. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2025.1641411/full">A study analyzing 334 individuals with long COVID</a> found widespread experiences of medical gaslighting. One researcher with long COVID wrote about <a href="https://www.abhmuseum.org/how-medical-gaslighting-ignores-black-women-with-long-covid/">witnessing &quot;woman after woman, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, race or country location, share stories about how doctors were not believing them about their COVID-19 symptoms&quot;</a>.</p><p>Our medicine and treatment plans for these illnesses often include CBT—cognitive behavioral therapy. Learning how to cultivate a positive headspace and mindset for any patient is a good thing, but it does not heal what needs to be healed. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6482658/">CBT for ME/CFS has been highly controversial</a>, with the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6498783/">influential PACE trial criticized for changing outcome criteria mid-study</a> and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6498783/">showing no objective improvement in fitness or physical function</a>. The <a href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">CDC removed CBT and GET (graded exercise therapy) recommendations from their ME/CFS guidance in 2017</a>.</p><p>These are illnesses with research underfunded in a field already severely under-resourced and overwhelmed. In a field where women and people of color are medically gaslit into thinking their pain isn't that bad and then die from lack of proper treatment. In a field where, conversely, doctors and nurses are subjected to verbal and physical abuse by patients.</p><p>ME/CFS <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor203173">receives only 7% of the funding that would be commensurate with its disease burden</a>, making it <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor203173">the most underfunded disease relative to burden among all diseases tracked by the NIH</a>. Research funding would need to increase <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor203173">roughly 14-fold to be commensurate with disease burden</a>. In 2025, <a href="https://mecfsscience.org/nih-funding-for-me-cfs-keeps-falling/">NIH funding for ME/CFS actually decreased</a> to $7.4 million for 18 projects, down from $10.1 million the previous year.</p><h2 id="living-in-the-schism" tabindex="-1">Living in the Schism <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#living-in-the-schism" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>This leaves those who still mask in an impossible position. We see the data. We understand the risks. We know people with long COVID, or we have it ourselves. We watch as <a href="https://news.aai.org/2025/02/27/long-covid-an-often-invisible-disability/">85% of disability claims are rejected on the first round</a>, as <a href="https://news.aai.org/2025/02/27/long-covid-an-often-invisible-disability/">additional medical expenses can run $8,000 per year per patient</a>.</p><p>We're living through what will be remembered as one of the largest public health failures in modern history. A preventable, mass disabling event that we collectively chose not to prevent.</p><h3 id="there-is-no-opinion-here" tabindex="-1">There is No Opinion, Here <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#there-is-no-opinion-here" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>The truth is, none of us have any ground to stand on when it comes to this argument. It is not simply a matter of opinion whether COVID-19 is an issue still or not. It is not an opinion whether masking is a good idea still or not. There is an ethical, moral answer here, and there is an unethical, immoral alternative which the majority of us are consistently choosing, whether deliberately or not.</p><p>As much as we are meant to be stewards of the land, we also must be stewards of each other. Of our community. Of those who cannot take care of themselves. Those who claim they care about accessibility must do the work to make socialization and gathering truly accessible and safe.</p><p>We must reckon with this complete schism in the perception of our current reality. We must tend and take care of our weak and ill. We must remember that empathy and love are the only ways out of this. We must remember that friction and good work are not things to run away from in exchange for convenience and expediency.</p><p>The pandemic isn't over. It never ended. We stopped caring.</p><p>And every day that disconnect continues, more people join the ranks of the disabled, more families face financial ruin, and more of our collective future is sacrificed on the altar of wanting things to be normal.</p><p>Normal isn't coming back. The question is how much more we're willing to lose before we accept that.</p>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>As I wrote about recently, I am not a full-stack developer. I have spent over a decade focusing on static-site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, and 11ty and other front-end work. All of my work online is hosted with services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. I'm grateful for these services, because they're free and accessible. But these are still platforms I don't which could close shop anytime. It's a fantastic way to get started, but it ultimately goes against the IndieWeb ethos.</p><p>I have over two dozen different projects online with Netlify, for instance, ranging from my main site <a href="https://brennan.day/">https://brennan.day</a> to a bunch of other projects, which you can view in <a href="https://berryhouse.ca/portfolio">my portfolio</a>. It's extremely cool how easy it is to take a git repo full of my files and have it online in a matter of minutes.</p><p>But Netlify is far from perfect. Does anybody <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/39062">remember GatsbyJS</a>? I was so excited to have a static-site framework that used React (mostly because everybody told me I needed to learn React to be employable, but that's beside the point). After <a href="https://www.netlify.com/press/netlify-acquires-gatsby-inc-to-accelerate-adoption-of-composable-web-architectures/">Gatsby was bought by Netlify</a>, the project died. It was clearly an acquihire but never stated as such.</p><p>This is just one problematic example of many, and proof that I need to start seriously thinking about running and hosting my own sites on my own bare metal. And that requires learning the back-end in earnest.</p><p>Why now? I certainly don't need to remind you that our world is in an fragile and unstable state right now. It would do everyone good to learn how to grow your own vegetables, sew your own clothing, learn proper first aid, and cultivate your own sourdough starter. Regardless of the state of the world, homesteading and permaculture are interesting and useful hobbies.</p><p>Before I go any further, I'm going to say here that <strong>nothing in this article has anything to do with artificial intelligence</strong>. This write-up is about timeless concepts and the things we carry. To work with our hands in the physical world, and maybe most idealistically of all, to restore our humanity.</p><h2 id="permacomputing" tabindex="-1">Permacomputing <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#permacomputing" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>I'm not the first person to work on the concept of digital homesteading, the idea of <a href="https://permacomputing.net/">permacomputing</a> has been around for a long while. I especially enjoy <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/permacomputing.html">Devine Lu Linvega's write-up</a> on the subject.</p><p>The term &quot;permacomputing&quot; was <a href="http://viznut.fi/texts-en/permacomputing.html">coined in 2020 by Ville-Matias &quot;Viznut&quot; Heikkilä</a>. Permaculture finds clever ways to let nature do the work with minimal artificial energy, and permacomputing asks: how do we make the most of existing computational resources rather than constantly demanding more power?</p><p>Maximize hardware lifespan, minimize energy usage, and use computation only when it has a strengthening effect on ecosystems. Instead of throwing away old hardware, find new purposes for it.</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Devine_Lu_Linvega_and_Rek_Bell_%282015%29.png" alt="Devine Lu Linvega and Rek Bell (2015) looking cool as hell.

In 2017, while trying to download a 10GB Apple Xcode update using only 5GB SIM cards, Devine Lu Linvega and Rekka Bellum had to put their iPhone in a bag and hoist it up the mast. This absurdity led them to create <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html">Uxn</a>, a tiny virtual machine that runs on everything from Game Boy Advance to Raspberry Pi Pico.</p><p>The first question permacomputing asks is: <strong>&quot;Where is technology not appropriate? Where can it be removed?&quot;</strong> Technology gets sold as a timesaver but just adds complexity and creates dependency on supply chains.</p><p>My project asks the question: what can I run myself, on hardware I control, that will work when third-party services don't?</p><p>The community has developed <a href="https://permacomputing.net/principles/">design principles</a> founded on permaculture's ethics: <strong>Earth Care, People Care, and Fair Share</strong>. Frugal computing means familiarizing yourself with using as little as needed while resources are available, similar to learning to use a first aid kit while still living in the city. You practice when correcting mistakes is still feasible.</p><p>Permacomputing exists as two intertwined strands: an incentive to reuse and repurpose existing technology, and evolving design principles to guide that reuse.</p><h2 id="my-own-project" tabindex="-1">My Own Project <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#my-own-project" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Despite graduating in April, I still have quite a few unused perks in my <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a> (which, by the way, you should definitely apply for if you're in school, even if you're not into computer science or programming). One of these perks is $200 in credits on DigitalOcean for a year. I've tried out DigitalOcean in the past, but don't currently use it for anything because it is overkill for my simple projects.</p><p>But this was a perfect opportunity for me to finally learn about cloud computing, databases, and devops with Docker and Caddy and break things without worry before transitioning over to using my own actual machines. My credits roughly translate to ~$16/mth which would buy me: <strong>2 GB Memory / 1 Intel vCPU / 70 GB SSD Disk / running Ubuntu 24.04 (LTS) x64.</strong></p><p>Going back to digital homesteading, my idea is this: I want to have a homelab monorepo which uses several different software applications in containers with Docker. I want to primarily have a machine that would take care of everything for me in the event that I have electricity but no Internet, but on the offchance the Internet survives the apocalypse, I also want community features as well.</p><p>To be clear, this project is still being hosted elsewhere (DigitalOcean) and is violating a number of permacomputing guidelines and principles. But I need to start somewhere. I want to learn on someone else's dime before beginning to implement my own lab. That's punk, right? Here's what I have, so far:</p><h3 id="core-infrastructure" tabindex="-1">Core Infrastructure <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#core-infrastructure" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><ul><li><strong>brennan.page</strong> - Landing page with service status dashboard</li><li><strong>docker.brennan.page</strong> - <a href="https://portainer.io/">Portainer</a> Docker management UI</li><li><strong>monitor.brennan.page</strong> - System monitoring with real-time stats</li><li><strong>files.brennan.page</strong> - <a href="https://filebrowser.org/">FileBrowser</a> file management interface</li><li><strong>wiki.brennan.page</strong> - Git-backed static documentation wiki</li></ul><h3 id="productivity" tabindex="-1">Productivity <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#productivity" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><ul><li><strong>tasks.brennan.page</strong> - <a href="https://vikunja.io/">Vikunja</a> task management system</li><li><strong>notes.brennan.page</strong> - <a href="https://hedgedoc.org/">HedgeDoc</a> collaborative markdown editing</li><li><strong>bookmarks.brennan.page</strong> - <a href="https://linkding.link/">Linkding</a> bookmark manager</li><li><strong>music.brennan.page</strong> - <a href="https://navidrome.org/">Navidrome</a> music streaming service</li></ul><h3 id="community-platforms" tabindex="-1">Community Platforms <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#community-platforms" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><ul><li><strong>blog.brennan.page</strong> - <a href="https://writefreely.org/">WriteFreely</a> minimalist blogging platform</li><li><strong>forum.brennan.page</strong> - <a href="https://flarum.org/">Flarum</a> community discussion forum</li><li><strong>rss.brennan.page</strong> - <a href="https://freshrss.org/">FreshRSS</a> feed aggregator</li><li><strong>share.brennan.page</strong> – <a href="https://plikshare.com/">Plik</a> temporary file sharing</li><li><strong>poll.brennan.page</strong> – <a href="https://rallly.co/">Rallly</a> meeting/poll scheduler</li></ul><p>Due to the rather weak specs, I didn't have enough overhead to implement certain software I wanted to, like <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> for media, but this was certainly a good-enough start. The important thing was learning how to use all of this stuff, and keeping track of my learning with the wiki and monitoring that would be in the server itself.</p><h2 id="implementation" tabindex="-1">Implementation <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#implementation" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>What started as a philosophical exploration quickly became practical education in backend development and systems administration. I broke the project into distinct phases.</p><h3 id="phase-1-foundation-infrastructure" tabindex="-1">Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#phase-1-foundation-infrastructure" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>The first step was establishing the core infrastructure. This meant setting up Docker as the container runtime, Caddy as a reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS, and a few management tools like Portainer for Docker management and FileBrowser for file ops. I created a simple landing page for all services on the root domain.</p><h3 id="phase-2-monitoring-and-documentation" tabindex="-1">Phase 2: Monitoring and Documentation <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#phase-2-monitoring-and-documentation" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>You can't manage what you can't measure. I implemented a monitoring system and a Git-backed wiki using MkDocs. Every configuration, troubleshooting step, and architectural decision is (supposedly) documented there.</p><p>Everything follows a local-first development workflow: I write content locally in Markdown, build it into a static site, and deploy it via rsync to the server.</p><h3 id="phase-3-personal-productivity" tabindex="-1">Phase 3: Personal Productivity <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#phase-3-personal-productivity" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>I moved on to implementing tools for personal productivity. This required setting up a shared PostgreSQL database to serve multiple applications. I deployed Vikunja for task management, HedgeDoc for collaborative note-taking, Linkding for bookmark management, and Navidrome for music streaming. Each service is containerized with proper resource limits and network isolation.</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/0*4P1GQVEGkMP3OeCY" alt="Photo by Oberon Copeland @veryinformed.com on Unsplash" /></p><h2 id="aside-mirroring-the-internet-to-preserve-knowledge" tabindex="-1">Aside: Mirroring the Internet to Preserve Knowledge <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#aside-mirroring-the-internet-to-preserve-knowledge" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>What happens when we lose access to human knowledge stored? The internet is fragile. <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/link-rot-study/">Websites disappear</a>, services shut down, and access can be cut off by infrastructure failures, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5gegrdq3go">censorship</a>, or economic collapse. This is where offline knowledge preservation becomes critical.</p><h3 id="wikipedia-in-your-pocket" tabindex="-1">Wikipedia in Your Pocket <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#wikipedia-in-your-pocket" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>A good solution is <a href="https://kiwix.org/en/">Kiwix</a>, an offline reader providing free access to knowledge for everyone without an internet connection, making educational content available in remote areas or during emergencies.</p><p>The entire English Wikipedia, including images, compresses down to approximately 89GB. Small enough to fit on a USB drive. For someone with limited storage, you could download a &quot;mini&quot; version of all Wikipedia with no images (around 12GB) plus topic-specific collections like computer science or medicine.</p><p>Kiwix also offers access to Wikisource, Wikiquote, Wikivoyage, Wikibooks, and Wikiversity, along with Project Gutenberg's open texts, TED conference talks, and Crash Course videos. The <a href="https://library.kiwix.org/">Kiwix library</a> contains thousands of ZIM files covering everything from Khan Academy lessons to medical wikis.</p><p>Setting up Kiwix is straightforward. Download the <a href="https://www.kiwix.org/en/downloads/">Kiwix tools</a>, grab your desired ZIM files from the <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/kiwix/zim/wikipedia/">Wikimedia dumps</a>, and run kiwix-serve to host the content locally. The entire process can be containerized with Docker, making it work with a homelab setup.</p><h3 id="additional-archiving-tools" tabindex="-1">Additional Archiving Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#additional-archiving-tools" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>While Kiwix specializes in wiki content, other tools handle different preservation needs:</p><p><strong>Internet Archive's Offline Mirror</strong>: The Internet Archive has developed <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/dweb-mirror">dweb-mirror</a>, an open-source project for creating offline mirrors of their vast collection. The project aims to make online collections available regardless of internet availability, addressing the significant factor that lack of internet access plays in educational outcomes and poverty.</p><p><strong>ArchiveBox</strong>: For personal web archiving, <a href="http://archivebox.io/">ArchiveBox</a> preserves bookmarks, research papers, social media content, or creating legal evidence archives. The data remains readable without needing to run ArchiveBox itself.</p><p><strong>HTTrack Website Copier</strong>: <a href="https://www.httrack.com/">HTTrack</a> is a free, open-source tool that downloads websites to your local directory, recursively building all structures and preserving the original site's link architecture.</p><p><strong>Project Gutenberg Mirroring</strong>: For those interested in preserving literature, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mirroring.html">Project Gutenberg offers mirroring guidelines</a>. The collection includes around 2 million files in over 60 languages and dozens of different formats, with new eBooks added almost daily. Using rsync, you can maintain a complete mirror of over 70,000 free books.</p><h3 id="implementation-1" tabindex="-1">Implementation <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#implementation-1" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>For my homelab, I'm planning to add a Kiwix container serving a curated selection of offline content:</p><ul><li><strong>Wikipedia &quot;mini&quot;</strong> (12GB): Coverage with article lead sections</li><li><strong>Computer topics &quot;nopic&quot;</strong> (443MB): Full articles for technical reference</li><li><strong>Project Gutenberg</strong> (via ZIM): Classic literature and reference texts</li><li><strong>Stack Exchange dumps</strong>: Programming Q&amp;A for offline reference</li></ul><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*GshC0rFQZLAeqPp0" alt="Photo by P.

It took me back to the days I was a teenager using a similarly-specced machine bought from Kijiji. The infrastructure currently runs on approximately 800MB of RAM usage (40% of available allocation), leaving headroom for growth.</p><h3 id="resource-management-strategy" tabindex="-1">Resource Management Strategy <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#resource-management-strategy" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Memory Limits</strong>: Every container has explicit memory limits to prevent runaway usage</li><li><strong>Shared Database</strong>: Instead of separate databases per service, I use a single PostgreSQL instance with multiple databases and users (though certain services require different database schemas)</li><li><strong>Lightweight Images</strong>: I prefer Alpine-based containers for their minimal footprint</li><li><strong>Network Segmentation</strong>: Docker networks are organized by function (caddy, internal_db, monitoring)</li></ul><h3 id="security-considerations" tabindex="-1">Security Considerations <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#security-considerations" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>The project implements good-enough security practices:</p><ul><li>SSH key authentication only (no password auth)</li><li>UFW firewall with minimal open ports</li><li>Docker network isolation between services</li><li>Automatic SSL certificates via Caddy</li></ul><h3 id="local-first" tabindex="-1">Local-First <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#local-first" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>All configurations are written and tested locally before deployment.

Why?</p><ul><li><strong>Version Control</strong>: Every change is tracked and can be rolled back</li><li><strong>Offline Development</strong>: I can work on configurations without internet access</li><li><strong>Disaster Recovery</strong>: The entire infrastructure can be rebuilt from the Git repository</li></ul><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>My current system hosts 11 active containers serving 8 different services, all with HTTPS certificates and monitoring. Response times are consistently under 200ms, isn't that impressive?</p><p>It's nice that now all my data resides on infrastructure I control, and there's no third-party data collection or advertising tracking. I'm not locked into any particular service provider's roadmap.</p><p>My homelab embodies permacomputing principles without me even realizing it. Working with a 2GB RAM constraint made me think like those <a href="https://permacomputing.net/">demoscene artists</a> who squeeze work from restricted resources.</p><p>I want to create ecosystems of services that work together, and yet have systems that can operate independently. And like our real world, it's important to make efficient use of limited resources, and to use open-source tools that can be endlessly modified and extended for our unknown future.</p><hr /><p>Of course, this isn't actually everything. I am still reliant on domain name registrars, payment processors, and a thousand other things. I've already quoted Carl Sagan previously, that if you want to bake an apple pie, you must first invent the universe. There is a lot at play here that aligns with that thinking. On the other hand, there is already so much that's here for us to use.</p><p>My homelab project is to take meaningful steps toward digital resilience, learning valuable skills, and building systems aligning with my values. In this world we share, having the knowledge and ability to maintain your own infrastructure is a radical act of hope.</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*GyUMPC4HATFzgD77" alt="Photo by Oberon Copeland @veryinformed.com on Unsplash" /></p>

    <description>A delightful surprise from an author I initially dismissed. Gilbert&#39;s Big Magic explores creativity as sacred play, rejecting the tortured artist myth for a lighter, more joyful approach to creative work.</description>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps like most people, my only exposure to Elizabeth Gilbert was knowing that she was the author of the very famous memoir with the eye-rolling title <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em>. I did not think she was a serious author, or someone I ought to read. And it's interesting—where does this instinct arise from? Simply because the title of her most well-known book so closely resembles <em>live, laugh, love</em>?</p><p>That is embarrassingly shallow of me. And truth be told, the only reason I decided to try to read Big Magic was because I read how Gilbert wrote about fantasizing about murdering her cancer-ridden girlfriend (after making her relapse into her addiction) in her newest book, <em>All the Way to the River: Love, Loss, and Liberation</em>. That, too, is still shallow.</p><p>Gilbert is, in reality, a literary figure. She has written several rich novels taught in classrooms. She has, in fact, devoted herself to the craft of writing. And with that, I will say how delightfully surprising <em>Big Magic</em> was.</p><p>It could be argued the thesis of this book is that ideas and creativity are transcendental, ethereal, not-of-this-world. I have personally found myself becoming increasingly religious over the years myself, and do not subscribe to the idea that the truth of reality can be known by only its material or my mere biological substrate. So already, off to a good start of mutual understanding, there.</p><p>I do disagree with Gilbert's notion that ideas have consciousness—the way she describes them as sprites that want so badly to manifest as real, and are always on the lookout for an artist to materialize them. And yet it is a wonderful way of operating.</p><p>And I certainly do believe creativity is sacred—and also, as she writes— simultaneously not sacred. There are a lot of contradictions to hold in understanding Gilbert's perception of creativity. And the paradoxes are deeply enjoyable and understandable.</p><p>Paraphrasing her friend and brilliant writer Robin Wall Kimmerer, Gilbert notes how we have lost touch with our relationship with nature. We love nature, but we do not believe nature loves us in return. And yet gardens can only be grown by us. We must choose to believe nature loves us, to no longer be deaf and blind to our reciprocal relationship with our surroundings.</p><p>And, Gilbert tells us, we must believe writing loves us the way we love writing. I believe this is the true thesis of the book, and it is so brilliant. The myth of the tortured artist—of suffering and martyrdom—is not only toxic but simply untrue.</p><p>When she was only a teenager, Gilbert made vows that she would do the work to be a writer for her entire life, and in exchange she just wanted the ability to write her entire life. She did not ask for success, she did not ask to produce good work. She asked merely to be able to work.</p><p>Because she loves the work. And it is so obvious yet so elusive. Creativity resembles religion because, in the idealised form, we surrender and have faith. We write and then we write more. The muse—whether sprite ideas or otherwise—are not cruel harsh creatures. Creativity finds us out of love.</p><p>Gilbert tells us there's a duality, a choice we can make: suffering or love. To have the dark, machismo death instinct of suffering is to be anti-creative. You will hoard the few ideas you have and treat them so, so seriously. Your works are not your babies—you are creativity's baby. Every piece you bring into the world matures <em>you</em>, makes you understand things a little better. You will be eaten alive by your own ego.</p><p>The alternative is light. A lightness, a playfulness. A gentle curiosity towards experiment. We must be the trickster instead of the martyr. And I think it is so telling that &quot;silly,&quot; once meant &quot;holy,&quot; &quot;blessed,&quot; or &quot;innocent&quot; in Old English. The holy fool is so full of wonder and curiosity. Creativity is joy!</p><p>We can try to divine creativity's motives, but they will remain occult. Our creations are best when we shrug our shoulders at the outcome but fiercely work at ensuring we finish the damn thing to a good enough state. And then, after that, we must keep writing. Going onward and wayward ever, never backward, onto the next thing.</p><p>The frustration, the disillusionment and disappointment we will inevitably face? They are not obstacles from the work and art. They <em>are</em> the work, just as much as the (many fewer) rancorous highs are.</p><p>Perhaps Gilbert is preaching to the choir here, perhaps I already write for the sake of writing. I have made it a promise to write 750 words a day, and I've kept that promise to myself for over a year now. Nonetheless, I think it was important for me to take a writer seriously who I previously scoffed at. Nonetheless, it is validating to see such a famous writer reject suffering and substitute it instead for the life instinct.</p>

    <description>A month of building, connecting, and discovering the independent web. Small technical joys that turned solitude into dialogue. Treat the Internet like a personal playground and lab!</description>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Around a month ago, after discovering <a href="https://omg.lol/">omg.lol</a> and writing <a href="https://blog.brennanbrown.ca/omg-lol-is-the-internet-we-need-right-now-3538199d5dea">an article</a> on it (which turned out to be one of my most popular, ever). I decided I finally needed to get serious about my own contributions to the IndieWeb. Sure, I've have <a href="https://brennanbrown.ca/">a portfolio</a> for years, but so what? This is performative and designed for recruiters and potential future employers.</p><p>No, I needed something entirely different, entirely just for me. to buy a new domain on <a href="https://porkbun.com/">PorkBun</a>, sign up on <a href="https://gitlab,.com/">GitLab</a> to build a <a href="https://gitlab.com/brennankbrown/brennan.day">new site from scratch</a> with a <a href="https://brennan.day/building-brennan-day-part-one-design-rainbows-and-accessibility/">design that sparked joy</a> for me, and finally sink my teeth and immerse myself into the independent Internet.</p><p>There are so many things that I could list off that have been positive in this experience so far. Creating all the different <a href="https://slashpages.net/">slash pages</a> for my site made me do an inventory of myself: what matters? what do I care about? What do I use on a daily basis that I ought to be grateful for? You can see all my different pages <a href="https://brennan.day/slash-pages/">here</a>.</p><p>These are not the kind of introspective questions you find yourself asking on a consistent basis on typical social media platforms (Instagram, TikTok, or God forbid X). There's just an overwhelming amount of content, of new information and stimuli to ever just meditate.</p><p>I found myself no longer merely writing navel-gazing articles and thinkpieces, I was actively trying to figure out how to improve my site for others and, in turn, share those improvements for others to copy. Because my site is entirely free and open source, meaning that anybody can outright take any code or ideas I share. And I encourage it!</p><p>I'd like to go over a few pieces of tech that I have been developing on my site since I began (warning: ultra-nerdy talk ahead):</p><ul><li>To start, I used <a href="https://indieauth.com/">IndieAuth</a> to add <a href="https://brennan.day/building-an-indieauth-comment-system-for-your-static-site/"><strong>a comment section</strong></a> to my blog posts. This means that other people can respond without needing to make yet another account and remember yet another password. All you need is your own website, which you really ought to have! This turned my website from a guy talking to himself into a proper dialogue, a to-and-fro.</li><li>I can <a href="https://brennan.day/posting-to-your-static-site-with-quill-and-micropub/"><strong>write posts anywhere online</strong></a> using the same code that I used to add a comment section, I also turned my website into an API that allows me to publish blog posts from <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a> with Micropub.</li><li>I got into the weeds and <a href="https://brennan.day/from-65-to-83-attempts-at-performance-optimization/"><strong>improved optimization,</strong></a> figuring out how to implement good coding practices to make my site load faster. For instance, my massive from-scratch CSS stylesheet was split up into fourteen different parts, with each part hashed so that the unchanged parts remain cached in people's browsers.</li><li>I extended the functionality of Robb Knight's <a href="https://brennan.day/extending-the-post-graph-plugin-adding-clickable-links-and-tooltips/"><strong>post graph plugin</strong></a>, which allows me to have a cool visualization of my posts on my homepage that's now fully interactable.</li><li>I found out about <a href="https://88x31.nl/history.html">the history of <strong>88x31 badges</strong></a>, and discovered over a dozen badges that I'm totally in love with to display on my own site, and also found <a href="https://ritual.sh/resources/button-generator/">a really awesome generator</a> to create my own!</li><li>To connect with others on the IndieWeb, I searched and added myself to <a href="https://anjackson.net/2022/12/17/revisiting-web-rings/"><strong>web rings</strong></a>, which are ways of connecting sites and adding social discoverability to your site without search engines.<ul><li>My site is now part of the <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/#brennan">XXIIVV Webring</a>, <a href="https://webring.bucketfish.me/">Bucketfish Webring</a>, <a href="https://hotlinewebring.club/">Hotline Webring</a>, <a href="https://static.quest/">Static.Quest Webring</a>, <a href="https://webring.dinhe.net/">Dinhe.net Webring</a>, the <a href="https://fediring.net/">Fediring</a> and of course, the <a href="https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/">IndieWeb Webring</a>.</li></ul></li><li>I used <a href="https://brennan.day/deploying-an-eleventy-site-to-neocities-with-gitlab-ci-cd/"><strong>GitLab's CI/CD</strong></a> to mirror my site to <a href="https://brennanday.neocities.org/">NeoCities</a>, giving me both a redundant backup of my site, but also allowing my site to live within NeoCities' ecosystem rather effortlessly.</li><li>I created a <a href="https://brennan.day/auld-lang-syne-the-commonplace-micro-log/"><strong>gratitude log</strong></a> that lives at <a href="https://log.brennan.day/">log.brennan.day</a>. This is particularly interesting because this subdomain is a site that lives in a separate repository that I'm <a href="https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/gratitude">tracking with Beeminder</a>. This means I need to update the site with my daily gratitude journal each day or else I have to pay! Talk about accountability and pushing myself to do what I know I ought to be doing.</li><li>I discovered even <a href="https://brennan.day/resources-for-the-personal-web-a-follow-up-guide/"><strong>more resources</strong></a> about the IndieWeb people could use to get started and immersed into the subculture.</li><li>I went through and made sure my website worked for people who have <a href="https://brennan.day/respecting-the-no-js-choice-making-your-site-work-for-everyone/"><strong>disabled Javascript</strong></a> on their web browser (or who don't have it at all, in the first place). Developers who rely on heavy frameworks like React or Vue are creating websites that will work for <em>most</em> people, sure, but not everyone. Creating an accessible website for everyone means <em>everyone</em>.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://brennan.day/assets/images/blog/tilde.jpg" alt="A terminal-style personal website for ~brennan@TTBP.

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>A few posts ago, I wrote up about how I <a href="https://brennan.day/setting-up-decap-cms-with-jekyll-a-real-world-example/">used IndieAuth to create a comment system</a> for my static site. The next stepped seemed to naturally be to add the ability to post content myself to my site from external clients.</p><p>I've tried different solutions for this in the past, <a href="https://brennan.day/setting-up-decap-cms-with-jekyll-a-real-world-example/">headless CMS like Decap</a>, but Micropub seemed like a more elegant solution for several reasons which I'll get into.</p><p><a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a> is probably the most popular Micropub client, letting you write posts to your site from a simple web interface. This post will be explaining how I built another endpoint for my site and how it fits together with my already-existing IndieAuth setup!</p><h2 id="what-is-micropub" tabindex="-1">What is Micropub? <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#what-is-micropub" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Let's start off by explaining what exactly <a href="https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/">Micropub</a> is. It's a W3C recommendation (meaning it’s reached the W3C’s highest maturity level for a web technology) that standardizes how you create, update, and delete content on your site.</p><p>Instead of logging into a custom domain panel, any Micropub-compatible client can post to your site. Your website becomes your API, and that's the really nice part about the IndieWeb, you can then choose what tools work best for you. Quill is one such client. It provides a clean, distraction-free writing interface sending posts to your site via the Micropub protocol.</p><h2 id="why-micropub" tabindex="-1">Why Micropub? <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#why-micropub" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>There are several reasons why somebody might want to use this setup. For starters, it means I can post from my phone using a Micropub client, which is <em>way</em> easier than trying to use an interface that play well with Git. It also means I am not locked into just one interface, because my site is my API, and I own my content. In the future, I could also build tools to post to my site programmatically, since this allows interoperability.</p><figure><img src="https://brennan.day/assets/images/blog/quill-screenshot.jpg" alt="Quill interface showing the post editor with the title 'Posting to Your Static Site with Quill and Micropub' and content being written." /><figcaption>Quill's clean, distraction-free writing interface means you can write a static post from anywhere. The rich text editor supports formatting while maintaining simplicity.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="architecture" tabindex="-1">Architecture <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#architecture" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>As we've already established, my site is static with no database or backend running. HTML files are generated by 11ty and deployed to Netlify, so how are posts recieved from Quill? Serverless functions, just like the comment system. The flow looks like this:</p><p>Quill sends a Micropub request to <code>https://brennan.day/micropub</code>, Netlify Function recieves the request, validates, and processes the content. The GitLab API commits the new post to the repository. Then, Netlify detects the new commit and rebuilds/redeploys the site with the new post online.</p><h2 id="quill-setup" tabindex="-1">Quill Setup <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#quill-setup" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>To get started, I configure Quill to communicate with my site, which requires a couple pieces of information: the Micropub endpoint which we already discussed, the Authorization endpoint and the token endpoint, both of which we can reuse from the comment system.</p><p>The authentication flow was already working from my comment system. Quill has additional scope requests, <code>profile create update media</code> with the &quot;create&quot; permission is allowing me to post content.</p><p>Now, let's get into the code itself.</p><h2 id="the-micropub-endpoint" tabindex="-1">The Micropub Endpoint <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-micropub-endpoint" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>The Micropub endpoint is a Netlify function that handles different types of requests.

    <description>A journey into making a website gracefully degrade for users without JavaScript, including the CSS-based .no-js approach, testing with Lynx, and creating an informative experience for all users.</description>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>In my most recent posts, I've been <a href="https://brennan.day/extending-the-post-graph-plugin-adding-clickable-links-and-tooltips/">tinkering</a> and <a href="https://brennan.day/from-65-to-83-attempts-at-performance-optimization/">getting into the weeds</a> of programming my site.</p><p>A lot of developers, I feel, are programming for a rather homogeneous end-user: they are viewing the site on the latest mobile or desktop device with the latest operating system, and on the latest supported browser (which most likely has Chrome underneath the hood).</p><p>There are luckily some wins we still keep up with, like responsive design due to the wide array of different screen sizes (there was a point in time where app developers only needed to have their app in one screen size on iOS, because there was only one iPhone screen resolution). But otherwise, it is a monolithic responsibility given to the end user: you need to buy recent devices, you need to run a certain up-to-date OS, and you have to use a web browser that most likely doesn't respect your privacy.</p><p>This is a lot to ask for, if not outright hostile to the end-user.</p><p>With this in mind, I've been thinking about accessibility and optionality. Not just screen readers or keyboard navigation (those kind of things should be default baked-in), but accessibility respecting user choice and how they choose to interact with the Internet.</p><p>With that, I decided to go through the process of better making my site properly degrade for users without JavaScript.</p><h2 id="why-bother-with-no-js" tabindex="-1">Why Bother with No-JS? <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#why-bother-with-no-js" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>If we're being honest, most web developers demand JavaScript be used by the end-user. Sites are built with extensive (read: <a href="https://dev.to/williamnogueira/the-problem-of-bloat-in-web-development-do-we-really-need-front-end-frameworks-14ma">bloated</a>) frameworks like React or Vue, fetching data dynamically and adding all sorts of complex interactivity where JavaScript is absolutely required.</p><p>But what about users who choose to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">disable JavaScript</a>? There are many reasons for this decision:</p><ul><li>Privacy-conscious users who block all scripts by default</li><li>People on slow connections or who are using older technology where JavaScript lags the experience or might not even be an option</li><li>Certain users of assistive technology</li><li>Terminal browser users</li><li>People simply trying to conserve battery on mobile</li></ul><p>Like with all accessibility principles, the end result is a better experience for <em>all</em> users, not just those who the accessibility is built for. Disabling JavaScript is a choice, and as web builders, we need to respect that choice.</p><h2 id="what-was-breaking" tabindex="-1">What Was Breaking? <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#what-was-breaking" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>In my process of adding various easter eggs and extending functionality, I have ended up with several JavaScript-dependent features on my site:</p><ul><li>The comment system (<a href="https://indieauth.net/">IndieAuth</a> authentication, form submission)</li><li>Status.lol widget in the sidebar</li><li>Theme toggle for dark/light mode</li><li>Search functionality (Pagefind)</li><li>Newsletter signup form</li><li>Post graph visualization</li><li>Various other interactive elements (tooltips, easter eggs, etc.)</li></ul><p>Without having JavaScript enabled, users were given no explanation nor any alternative. Parts of the experience simply broke with awkward empty spaces.</p><h2 id="the-solution-css-based-progressive-enhancement" tabindex="-1">The Solution: CSS-Based Progressive Enhancement <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-solution-css-based-progressive-enhancement" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>The approach I settled on is this: start with <code>no-js</code> and let JavaScript remove it. This is a form of <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/">progressive enhancement</a>, which differs from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Graceful_degradation">graceful degradation</a>.</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token doctype"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;!</span><span class="token doctype-tag">DOCTYPE</span><span class="token name">html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span><span class="token attr-name">lang</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>en<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>no-js<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><p>Then, the very first script that runs:</p><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// Remove no-js class immediately when JS is enabled</span>document<span class="token punctuation">.</span>documentElement<span class="token punctuation">.</span>classList<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">remove</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'no-js'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><p>This creates two states automatically:</p><ol><li><strong>With JavaScript</strong>: <code>.no-js</code> is removed, everything works normally</li><li><strong>Without JavaScript</strong>: <code>.no-js</code> stays, and we can style accordingly</li></ol><h2 id="hiding-the-right-things" tabindex="-1">Hiding the Right Things <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#hiding-the-right-things" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>With the <code>.no-js</code> class in place, I can now hide JavaScript-dependent features:</p><pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token comment">/* Hide JavaScript-dependent features when JS is disabled */</span><span class="token selector">.no-js .js-required</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token property">display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> none <span class="token important">!important</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token selector">.no-js #theme-toggle</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token property">display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> none <span class="token important">!important</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token selector">.no-js .comments-section</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token property">display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> none <span class="token important">!important</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token selector">.no-js #status-lol-container</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token property">display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> none <span class="token important">!important</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>But just hiding things isn't enough.

A slightly better alternative will have messaging asking the user nicely to enable JavaScript (so the site can work and stop being broken). Even better than that, a site will acknowledge and state that &quot;some features require JavaScript&quot;.</p><p>But the best thing you can do is outright state that it's okay for the end-user to not use JavaScript, and provide an explanation of what they're missing out on and what alternatives you can offer them.</p><p>This is what I did. The link in the noscript message goes to <a href="https://brennan.day/no-js">/no-js/</a>, which is a dedicated page explaining:</p><ul><li>What works without JavaScript (all content, navigation, RSS, etc.)</li><li>What requires JavaScript and why</li><li>Alternatives for each feature</li><li>My commitment to accessibility</li></ul><p>It's a resource for users to understand the trade-offs and make informed decisions, which is their right.</p><h2 id="testing-with-lynx" tabindex="-1">Testing with Lynx <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#testing-with-lynx" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>How do you know if your site really works without JavaScript?

The noscript message appeared at the top. The status section showed empty (as expected). The search page had no search interface.

    <description>The Greenland debate keeps asking whether the U.S. could take it, or whether Denmark should keep it. The missing question is: What do the Greenlanders want? They’ve already answered: &#39;We don’t want to be Americans. We don’t want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders.&#39; This is about Indigenous sovereignty and the quiet billionaire scramble for Greenland’s resources.</description>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>We have, regrettably, been privy to Trump's desire of taking over Greenland in an imperial, hostile manner for a long while now. I don't know how many people even remember how he <a href="https://time.com/5653167/trump-buy-greenland-memes/">announced the claim during his first presidency</a> back in 2019, when he wasn't banned on Twitter, and when Twitter existed.</p><p>Back then, the claim was regarded as a &quot;meme&quot;, a rather hilarious proposition only in how absurd it was. The logistics were impossible. There was no gravity pulling the claim back to the actual living world.</p><p>How things have changed. The progressive few (and yet always growing) have been telling everyone else <em>over and over</em> that claims like these were, in fact, <strong>not</strong> made in jest.</p><p>We have been promised that <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/ice-and-deportations-how-trump-reshaping-immigration-enforcement">ICE, who has turned into Trump's Schutzstaffel, would detain every undocumented immigrant in the country</a>. We have been promised that <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/11/department-of-education-dismantling-trump/">education in the United States would collapse as we know it</a>, that <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/trump-administration-plans-deep-cuts-to-social-security-disability-insurance-particularly-for">social security and any other public benefits would be irreversibly transformed for the worst</a>. None of this has been bluffing or hypothetical rhetoric. It is all happening.</p><p>Where we stand now is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6387569079112">pundits on Fox News</a> and elsewhere now trying to ascertain the logistics and probability of a United States takeover of Greenland. Trump's cabinet is preparing plans, and instead of impeachment and sanctions, the world is carefully hedging <em>just how exactly</em> grim and atrocious such a takeover would be.</p><p>And this isn't actually about Greenland. Trump has made numerous comments about <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-remarks-on-canada-becoming-the-51st-state-raise-a-lot-of-questions">Canada being the 51st state</a>, has said that <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/5/trump-threatens-colombias-petro-says-cuba-looks-like-its-ready-to-fall">Cuba needs to fall</a>, and that it would be 'OK' <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/trump-us-military-cartels-mexico-land.html">launching strikes in Mexico to fight drug smuggling</a>.</p><p>When you line all of these comments up alongside the fact that <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/5/venezuelas-abducted-leader-maduro-wife-to-appear-in-nyc-court">the president of Venezuela was kidnapped by the United States</a>, and Trump recently posted a photo of himself as <a href="https://time.com/7345445/trump-venezuela-acting-president-wikipedia-truth-social/">&quot;sitting president&quot; of the country</a>, the picture becomes clear. Trump wants the United States to be the United States of <em>Americas</em>, north and south.</p><p>Such aggression, on such a scale, has not been witnessed since the second world war. And yet here we are, clutching our pearls in uncertain terms, dislocating our cognitive capabilities towards a new frontier of dissonance.</p><h2 id="who-are-the-greenlanders" tabindex="-1">Who are the Greenlanders? <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#who-are-the-greenlanders" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>All of this, though, is mere prelude. Is mere context. I do, in fact, want to discuss Greenland specifically, because there is a specific conversation I don't see anybody having.</p><p>The current pop culture rhetoric looks at Greenland being threatened by Trump and rightfully being land owned by Denmark.</p><p>But Greenland is 90% Inuit, 90% Indigenous. Where are their voices in this conversation?</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/greenlands-party-leaders-firmly-reject-trumps-push-for-u-s-takeover-of-island"><em>&quot;We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,&quot;</em></a><em>Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and four party leaders said in a statement Friday night.</em></p></blockquote><p>The Inuit population of Greenland has been fighting for sovereignty of their land for decades. Positive progress was being made. And now, perhaps all of that progress is catastrophically gone.</p><p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/3942/15406132357_9de3b4df4a_c.jpg" alt="Dog Sledding in Uummannaq, Greenland" title="Dog Sledding in Uummannaq, Greenland" /></p><p>As though when a crybully nation such as the United States comes into the fray, any sort of optics of caring or valuing Indigenous livelihood is tossed away. The white men must determine who owns the land. History is the future is history.</p><p>The Inuit have inhabited Greenland for thousands of years, yet <a href="https://origins.osu.edu/read/greenland-sovereignty-denmark">Denmark colonized Greenland in 1721</a> when missionary Hans Egede arrived to convert the population to Christianity. For over 230 years, <a href="https://visitgreenland.com/articles/modern-greenland/">Greenland existed as a Danish colony</a>, with Greenlanders having no voice in their own governance. Denmark tightly controlled the island, restricting Greenlanders from commerce with other nations, suppressing Indigenous cultural practices, and forcing assimilation.</p><p>The Inuit have inhabited Greenland for thousands of years (<a href="https://www.freezeframe.ac.uk/collection/photos-british-arctic-air-route-expedition-1930-31/p48-16-259">Source</a>)</p><p>It wasn't until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Greenland">1953 that Denmark integrated Greenland as a county</a>, ending its official colonial status, though this was done without a referendum, a point still controversial. The fight for true self-determination began in earnest in the 1970s. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2154896X.2024.2342117">In 1979, Greenlanders achieved Home Rule</a>, establishing their own parliament and gaining control over domestic affairs like education, health, and housing.</p><p>The most significant victory came with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenlandic_independence">the 2009 Self-Government Act</a>, passed after 75% of Greenlanders voted in favour. This historic agreement <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2026/01/who-owns-greenland">recognized Greenlanders as a distinct people under international law</a> with the right to self-determination and the ability to pursue full independence through referendum. The Greenlandic language replaced Danish as the official language. Natural resources, including the vast mineral wealth and potential oil and gas reserves, came under Greenlandic control.</p><p>This was much more than administrative reorganization; it was <a href="https://www.diis.dk/en/research/why-is-greenland-part-of-the-kingdom-of-denmark-a-short-history">the recognition of Indigenous sovereignty</a> after centuries of colonial rule. The Inuit of Greenland were finally on a path to determining their own future, building economic self-sufficiency to support full independence. As the Greenlandic economy becomes less dependent on Danish subsidies—which currently constitute about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenlandic_independence">two-thirds of the government budget</a>—the path to full sovereignty becomes more viable.</p><p>That path is under serious jeopardy by a government responsible for the <a href="https://www.theindigenousfoundation.org/articles/a-brief-history-on-the-trail-of-tears">Trail of Tears </a>and genocide of multiple Indigenous Peoples throughout Turtle Island. This should come as no surprise to anybody though, should it? Even in present times, <a href="https://ictnews.org/news/five-native-americans-detained-by-ice-during-ongoing-raids-in-minneapolis/">ICE has detained Native Americans for being undocumented citizens</a>, yet another example the pure absurdity bleeding from of our wild, wild wasteland.</p><p>And what makes this entire spectacle even more grotesque is that the colonial imagination does not merely express itself through statecraft and gunboats. It expresses itself through venture capital and strategic &quot;investments.&quot; The moment Trump began floating the idea of &quot;acquiring&quot; Greenland, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinadilicosa/2026/01/09/these-billionaires-bet-big-on-greenland-after-trump-took-interest/">a constellation of billionaires—including Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg, Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, and Ronald Lauder—moved quickly to secure stakes</a> in Greenland's freshwater, mineral, and energy sectors.</p><p>We are told this is about green innovation and rare earths and market opportunity, but the pattern is unmistakable: yet again, outsiders positioning themselves to extract value from Indigenous land without Indigenous consent. Billionaires treating Greenland as unregulated frontier for lithium and freshwater capitalism, and we continue the old territorial colonialism of Europe and the new resource colonialism of Silicon Valley. It is not enough for Greenland to be seized by a state—it must also be carved up by capital. The Inuit become incidental to the transaction, reduced to scenery in someone else's speculative prospectus.</p><p>Perhaps the most useful thing I can write here is that the fight for Indigenous sovereignty matters because it means actually being value-aligned and invoking proper praxis. We can argue amongst ourselves online about the right thing to say, or what the right take is on one of dozens of currently-ongoing atrocities, but that is not pushing us forward.</p><p>Our brothers and sisters, those who are keepers of this land, who understand the sacred around us, ought to be listened to. There is, within the Indigenous imagination, a hopeful possibility for a better future. A way through the horror, a way we can find light from the mere glints in our shared overwhelming darkness.</p><p>Trump's imperial warmongering threatens Greenland's political status. The United States now threatens to erase the hard-won progress of an Indigenous people's decades-long struggle for self-determination.</p><p>When powerful nations treat territories as chess pieces to be traded or seized, we return to the colonial mindset: Indigenous voices don't matter, centuries of occupation grant more legitimacy than millennia of habitation. The Greenlanders have made their position clear. The question is whether the world will listen. Or whether, once again, Indigenous sovereignty will be sacrificed to the ambitions of empires in bloodlust.</p><h2 id="learn-more-about-indigenous-greenlanders" tabindex="-1">Learn More About Indigenous Greenlanders <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#learn-more-about-indigenous-greenlanders" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>For readers who want to go further, here are some resources on Kalaallit Nunaat (Greenland), and whose culture, language, and political identity shape the island's contemporary reality.</p><p>For Indigenous rights and political context, the <a href="https://iwgia.org/en/kalaallit-nunaat-greenland.html"><strong>International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs</strong></a> maintains a detailed profile on Inuit self-government, decolonization, and ongoing challenges.</p><p>To situate Greenland within broader circumpolar Indigenous politics, the <a href="https://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/"><strong>Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC)</strong></a> represents Inuit from Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Chukotka and publishes position papers on sovereignty, environmental governance, and Arctic policy.</p><p>For deeper political analysis on devolution and independence, <a href="https://www.northernpublicaffairs.ca/greenlandic-inuit-sovereignty-independence"><strong>Northern Public Affairs</strong></a> has published work on sovereignty, the 2009 Self-Government Act, and the pathway toward full independence.</p><p>For cultural and historical background, <a href="https://www.native-languages.org/greenlandic.htm"><strong>Native Languages of the Americas</strong></a>provides accessible context on Inuit language, traditions, and cultural continuity:</p><p>Finally, UNESCO's profile on <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/kujataa-greenland-norse-and-inuit-farming-edge-ice-cap"><strong>Kujataa</strong></a>, a World Heritage site at the edge of the ice sheet, offers insight into millennia of Inuit adaptation and land use.</p>

    <title>From 65 to 83: Attempts at Performance Optimization</title>

    <description>A humble look into the performance optimizations boosting my Lighthouse score from 65 to 83, including critical CSS, layout shift fixes, and image optimization while maintaining the site&#39;s design and user experience</description>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight, I went to <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-brennan-day/0pwed2f655?form_factor=mobile">PageSpeed Insights</a> ran a Lighthouse audit on my site. The results? A performance score of 65.</p><p>Let's be honest: for a JAMstack site, this is a failure. A static site should be hitting +95s across the board. We're talking about pre-built HTML, minimal JavaScript, and a CDN. This is supposed to be the fast lane of the web.</p><p>I have made design choices that prioritize aesthetics and user experience over raw speed. And I think that's okay. I use Google Fonts instead of web fonts (Zach Leatherman would hate this, I know.) I use PT Serif, Public Sans, and JetBrains Mono for body, headings, and metadata respectively.</p><p>Right off the bat, that's three font files adding ~750ms to first paint. I could easily use system fonts and shave off that time, but I would lose design. Speaking of fonts, I also use FontAwesome icons to add visual context and personality to the interface. The cute little envelope icon next to &quot;Contact&quot; and the RSS icon in navigation? Not essential at all, but they make the site feel more human and approachable. That's another 340ms.</p><p>A bigger elephant in the room is that I currently have CSS architecture with 13 separate files, because it keeps my code organized and maintainable. Until yesterday, I actually was stuffing all my CSS into one massive file. This was over 3,000 lines because I get so in-the-weeds with styles, and bloated the critical path.</p><p>I try my best to keep my use JavaScript to things that are optional and not actually improtant. Like hovering tooltips, the post graph being clickable, the scroll progress bar, theme toggling, and a few easter eggs. All of this adds bytes and execution time, but I like to think the joy and fun it adds to the UX is worth it.</p><p>You can read more about my design choices in my <a href="https://brennan.day/colophon/">colophon</a>.</p><p>After some simple fixes, I was able to get the score to 83 through a series of optimizations, each tested individually to ensure nothing broke.</p><h2 id="the-starting-line" tabindex="-1">The Starting Line <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-starting-line" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Here's what Lighthouse initially told me:</p><ul><li><strong>Performance</strong>: 65</li><li><strong>First Contentful Paint (FCP)</strong>: 4.2s</li><li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</strong>: 4.8s</li><li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</strong>: 0.142</li><li><strong>Estimated savings from render-blocking resources</strong>: 1,050ms</li><li><strong>Estimated savings from image delivery</strong>: 71 KiB</li><li><strong>Forced reflows</strong>: 74ms each, happening twice</li></ul><p>The audit identified several key issues: render-blocking CSS, layout shifts, missing image dimensions, and some JavaScript performance problems.</p><h2 id="1-critical-css-the-biggest-win-1-050ms-savings" tabindex="-1">1.

This was because the SVG symbols use <code>fill=&quot;currentColor&quot;</code>, which required a different CSS approach than the old font icons.</p><p>Instead of trying to override <code>fill</code> on the SVG elements, I needed to set the <code>color</code> property on the parent SVG containers:</p><pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token selector">.verify-card h2 svg,.verify-card .verify-links svg</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token property">color</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token function">var</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>--card-accent<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token important">!important</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>This is a great example of how SVG icons differ from font icons - they inherit colors through <code>currentColor</code> rather than directly accepting <code>fill</code> properties in all cases.

The critical CSS strategy that helped mobile was causing massive layout shifts on desktop, with a CLS score of 1.438!</p><p>Critical CSS included the grid layout change but not the actual sidebar styles. On fast desktop connections:</p><ol><li>Content rendered immediately in single-column layout</li><li>When deferred CSS loaded, the sidebar appeared, shifting the main content dramatically</li><li>This created a worse user experience on desktop than before optimization</li></ol><p>The fix was to add essential sidebar styles to the critical CSS block:</p><ul><li>Added <code>.sidebar</code>, <code>.sidebar .module</code>, and related styles inline</li><li>Added <code>font-display: swap</code> for all fonts to reduce font-loading shift</li><li>Added preconnect hint for status.lol (which is a whole 'nother thing) to reduce network latency</li></ul><p>This is a reminder performance optimizations aren't one-size-fits-all. What helps mobile might hurt desktop, and vice versa. Test across different devices and network conditions!</p>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>I'm sure I'm not the only person that's motivated by GitHub's contribution graph. Of course, they have their fair share of <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/2020-05-29-github-activity-graphs-are-meaningless/">valid criticism</a> and can easily be <a href="https://github.com/Shpota/github-activity-generator">exploited</a>. But when they are used for their as they're supposed to, as a way of simply keeping track and visually displaying progress, I think they're fun and fuflling.</p><p>I'm not the only one that thinks this. Creator of web curios, <a href="https://rknight.me/">Robb Knight</a>, created the <a href="https://postgraph.rknight.me/">eleventy-plugin-post-graph</a>, which emulates the contribution graph for posts on your 11ty blog.</p><p>And it was 2 AM (maybe 3 AM) and I couldn't sleep. I was having one of those nights where my brain just wouldn't shut off. I was staring at my homepage, clicking through the archive, and thought, &quot;wouldn't it be cool if these little green squares actually did something?&quot;</p><p>I decided that I wanted to enhance the features of this, specifically, I wanted users on desktop to be able to hover and click on filled squares and jump directly to corresponding posts. Here's how I did it.</p><p>The plugin <code>@rknightuk/eleventy-plugin-post-graph</code> is configured in <code>.eleventy.js</code> and rendered via this simple shortcode:</p><pre class="language-njk"><code class="language-njk"><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token operator">%</span><span class="token variable">postGraph</span><span class="token variable">collections</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token variable">posts</span><span class="token operator">%</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><h2 id="the-challenge" tabindex="-1">The Challenge <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-challenge" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>The plugin only tracked post counts per day, not <em>which</em> posts corresponded to which dates. While it does handle finding dates from either the frontmatter (<code>post.data.date</code>) or the file itself (<code>post.date</code>), there's no way to get the actual post URLs or titles from the plugin itself. It's purely a visualization tool.</p><p>Additionally, I needed to consider timezones, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/dates/#dates-off-by-one-day">a common pitfall</a> in Eleventy functionality. Some of my posts had timezone information (<code>2025-12-26T12:00:00-07:00</code>) while others were simple dates (<code>2025-12-11</code>).</p><p>First mistake? I tried monkey-patching the plugin. Don't do that. It's a mess, and honestly, I spent two hours before realizing I was being an idiot.</p><h2 id="solution-custom-shortcode-implementation" tabindex="-1">Solution: Custom Shortcode Implementation <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#solution-custom-shortcode-implementation" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Rather than modifying <code>node_modules</code> I decided to create to write custom shortcode, which gave me full control over the HTML output and data handling.

And using the same timezone handling the rest of my site has prevented any date alignment issues.</p><p>The graph remains functional even without JavaScript, following the principle of progressive enhancement. And semantic HTML and ARIA attributes are used for accessibility.</p><p>The post graph now provides an interactive experience, with the static visualization now an interactive navigation tool!</p><p>I want to also note that the original plugin had quite a few features I didn't implement. There's a <code>dayBoxTitle</code> option that adds basic date tooltips (which I expanded to include post titles), year linking for archive pages, support for multiple graphs with different styles, and even custom data options for unusual Eleventy setups. I kept things simple since I just needed the core functionality with my tooltip enhancement, but it's cool to see how much thought Robb put into the original plugin.</p><p>You can read the <a href="https://gitlab.com/brennankbrown/brennan.day/-/blob/main/.eleventy.js?ref_type=heads">full code here</a>, starting on line 431.

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, I wrote about <a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/brennan">omg.lol</a> on my Medium blog, and something unexpected happened. The response was surprising! <a href="https://blog.brennanbrown.ca/omg-lol-is-the-internet-we-need-right-now-3538199d5dea">Thousands of reads and a dozen of comments</a>, and dozens of people signing up with my referral, taking the leap into the independent web. People who had been lurking on the sidelines for years suddenly had their own corner of the Internet.</p><p>But with that excitement came questions. <em>Where else should I look? What other tools exist? How do I find others like me?</em></p><p>This follow-up is for all of you who read that article and thought, &quot;I'm ready for more.&quot; Whether you're a writer exhausted by algorithms dictating your reach, a creator wanting escape from the platform churn, or simply someone who remembers when the Internet felt <em>fun</em>, then this guide is your next step.</p><h2 id="the-state-of-search-why-this-guide-is-needed" tabindex="-1">The State of Search (Why This Guide is Needed) <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-state-of-search-why-this-guide-is-needed" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Before we dive into resources, we need to talk about why human curation matters more than ever.</p><p><a href="https://www.impactlab.com/2025/07/19/the-death-of-google-search/">Google search is collapsing.</a> Between 2021 and 2025, websites experienced traffic losses exceeding 60% from organic search, with quality content creators punished while AI-generated spam flourished. Confirmed algorithm updates decreased from 10 annually in 2021-2022 to just 4 in 2025, yet volatility reached record-breaking levels.</p><p>By 2025, much of the web has been consolidated into walled gardens, polluted by generative AI producing near-infinite low-quality articles, and <a href="https://ppc.land/seo-consultant-tracks-googles-shift-from-predictable-to-chaotic/">optimized to death by SEO tactics</a>. For news publishers specifically, Google Web Search traffic declined from <a href="https://ppc.land/news-publishers-lose-half-their-google-search-traffic-in-two-years/">51% to 27% between 2023 and 2025</a>.</p><p>This is less about nostalgia than it is survival. Search engines fail and AI floods the void with slop. Human curation becomes essential infrastructure. We need directories. We need blogrolls. We need people pointing to other people.</p><p>Forget about using LLMs for research. This is about moving toward a more human, less sterilized, boring Internet. Let's explore the tools that make that possible.</p><h2 id="part-one-sillyblogging-with-pika" tabindex="-1">Part One: Sillyblogging with Pika <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#part-one-sillyblogging-with-pika" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>I'm going to focus this guide for Medium writers and readers, for those who care about the craft of writing. There's a certain expectation when writing on Medium: you're expected to be well-researched, or at the very least, provide value to an audience.</p><p>That's important, obviously, but it can be detrimental to your writing if that's the <em>only</em> kind of writing you're doing. You end up obsessed with metrics, with what others are looking for you to write.</p><p>What you need is a playground. A sandbox. You might think your private notes or text documents count for this, but no, not really. You need to think in public, learn in public—and writing is one of the best ways to think and learn.</p><blockquote><p>Liberate yourself and give self-permission to write whatever you want, blog about whatever you like, no matter how silly!</p></blockquote><p>Maybe omg.lol is too technical or the cost doesn't seem worth it (even though $20/year is still far cheaper than other options). That's fine, because I found blogging platforms I enjoy even more than omg.lol that have free options.</p><p>The first is rather popular: <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>, an ultra-minimalist blogging platform—very web 1.0. If you don't mind having <em>only</em> text, then this option might be right for you.</p><p><img src="https://brennan.day/assets/images/blog/pika.jpg" alt="A bald person wearing glasses and a patterned sweater with a brown vest sits at a desk, smiling with a single tear on their cheek while working at a computer.

Good Enough is a zine publisher and small web dev company that makes <em>good</em> small products. Here's their full list:</p><ul><li><a href="https://pika.page/"><strong>Pika</strong></a>: A pretty good blogging platform that makes blogging easy and beautiful. Hop in and start writing for yourself. Barry did. Why don't you?</li><li><a href="https://letterbird.co/"><strong>Letterbird</strong></a>: A simple contact form on the web. Give people a great experience getting in touch with you, and stop giving out your personal email address.</li><li><a href="https://albumwhale.com/"><strong>Album Whale</strong></a>: A social-light platform where you can make beautiful lists of albums and discover new music through other beautiful lists. Let's bring back albums. And whales.</li><li><a href="http://doevery.day/"><strong>DoEvery.Day</strong></a>: A simple calendar and logbook for your daily practice, whatever that may be. Choose what you want to do every day, and do it, every day.</li><li><a href="https://guestbook.goodenough.us/"><strong>Printer</strong></a>: They have a little thermal printer hooked up to the internet where people can send them a drawing (won't you, please?).</li><li><a href="https://beta.quack.page/"><strong>Quack (beta)</strong></a>: A simple utility to share a beautifully rendered version of any markdown text. Also an excuse for them to draw a duck.</li></ul><h3 id="why-pika" tabindex="-1">Why <a href="https://pika.page/">Pika</a>? <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#why-pika" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>Pika has a list of features that I think are excellent and compelling:</p><ul><li>Guestbook entries (up to 50)</li><li>Image uploads</li><li>Simple, fun theming</li><li>Custom homepage (footer, CSS, etc.)</li><li>Verification to Mastodon</li><li>Export options</li><li>And, most importantly, a fantastic writing experience</li></ul><p>The only catch is that there is a limit of <strong>50 posts</strong> on their free tier. After that, it's $6/month or $60/year. Still miles cheaper than Squarespace or Ghost or any other typical options.</p><p>And you know what? That's a fantastic limitation to try to reach. How many of us actually produce fifty of anything? At that point, you're serious enough about your craft and public presence that you owe it to yourself to find a better solution and pay the cost that it's worth.</p><p>Fifty posts. They don't need to be long-form or deep and meaningful. What's important is that you're writing.</p><h3 id="the-100-days-to-offload-challenge" tabindex="-1">The 100 Days to Offload Challenge <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-100-days-to-offload-challenge" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3><p>There's actually a specific blogging challenge, created by <a href="https://kevquirk.com/">Kev Quirk</a>, called <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/"><strong>100 Days to Offload</strong></a>, where the challenge is to publish 100 posts on your personal blog within 365 days, starting whenever you want, writing about whatever interests you.</p><p>One blogger found it increased their web traffic by 20-30x, with some posts getting shared widely enough to receive 250x their usual pre-challenge daily traffic.</p><p>The <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/#hall-of-fame">Hall of Fame</a> includes people who've done it multiple times, with some as many as four times over.</p><p>Once you reach these kinds of numbers, you'll strengthen your writing, you'll have a voice and something meaningful to offer the world. Ever since I started <a href="https://brennan.day/">my own personal site</a>, I notice that not everything I write there ends up on my Medium, and that's okay.

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, webcrafter! I added a functional comment section to my static site using IndieAuth and thought it might be helpful to explain how I implemented things. There were quite a few pitfalls along the way that I want to make point of to help anybody else that wants to do something similar. Enjoy the read!</p><h2 id="why-not-just-use-disqus" tabindex="-1">Why Not Just Use Disqus? <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#why-not-just-use-disqus" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Before I start, I know that there are already more convenient solutions. But when you use 3rd-party comment systems, you're giving away conversations, community engagement, and often user data to someone else. Creating your own means you have full ownership and possibility, and you don't have to worry about the bloat from pre-created widgets.</p><p>But there's something else. I think it's important we figure out solutions for the IndieWeb and frontend-only JAMstack static websites. It can be tempting to try to figure out databases or start looking at a LAMP stack with PHP and SQL in the back, but I've been a firm believer that the Internet has evolved to a point where we no longer require a full-stack solution, especially when you're dealing with something as simple as a blog or a personal site or something informational.</p><p>The onus is on us as developers in this space to figure out solutions for dynamic content within the static space, that is the definition of JAMstack. And that's why I founded <a href="https://berry.house/">Berry House</a> in the first place.</p><p>I enjoy having a personal site because it means I can write and display my own personal work however I want. But I think it's also important to implement access to the commons—to have the ability for others to share their thoughts and respond just as easily as it is for me to present my own. I think aa lot of personal sites I've encountered does not have this capability, and they are simply exercising the act of sharing without feedback. Typically. people go to Mastodon or email or <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmentions</a> as a way to have communication with other people on the IndieWeb, but that doesn't satisfy the idea I have of commons and communication.</p><p>My wants are:</p><ul><li>Comments stored in my GitLab repository via a .JSON file</li><li>Authentication via users' own websites (IndieAuth)</li><li>No tracking, no ads, minimal JavaScript</li><li>Respect of privacy, open web, and digital commons</li></ul><p>To do this:</p><ul><li>Comment form that authenticates users via IndieAuth</li><li>Server-side functions to handle the authentication and comment storage</li><li>A lightweight frontend playing nice with the rest of my site</li></ul><p>The tools I am using:</p><ul><li><strong>11ty</strong> (Eleventy) for our static site</li><li><strong>Netlify Functions</strong> for serverless backend</li><li><strong>GitLab</strong> for comment storage</li><li><strong>IndieAuth</strong> for authentication</li></ul><h2 id="getting-started-with-indieauth" tabindex="-1">Getting Started with IndieAuth <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#getting-started-with-indieauth" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>First, what is IndieAuth? It's a way to sign in to websites using your own domain name. If you have a website, you can use it to log in anywhere that supports IndieAuth, no need for yet another username and password.</p><p>To set this up, you need to add two links to your site's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>link</span><span class="token attr-name">rel</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>authorization_endpoint<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>https://indieauth.com/auth<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>link</span><span class="token attr-name">rel</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>token_endpoint<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>https://tokens.indieauth.com/token<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><p>These tell IndieAuth providers where to send authentication requests and where to exchange authorization codes for access tokens.

I'm much more of a writer than I am a web developer (I got my degree in English instead of computer science, after all). And my favourite projects are the ones that are a hybrid of the humanities and sciences.</p><p>I really love the idea of people being able to freely submit their work and to collaboratively workshop and share in a space that isn't Google Docs or another corporate-owned silo with heavy surveillance and data exploitation.</p><p>I feel as though there's a lot of meat on this to chew on, like figuring out interesting ways to use handcoded HTML and CSS to make really interesting and creative zines.</p><p>And I understand that there's a lot of friction with these solutions right now, simply because they are rather obscure and niche, and a lot of people prioritize convenience over their privacy and freedom. But we're luckily seeing a shift in culture in the trade-off of expediency for our personhood and identity.</p><p>Maybe it's over-optimistic of me, and maybe I'm going to jinx it, but I truly feel that 2026 is going to be the year of the independent web. I feel as though there's a cascade and critical mass occurring of people who are going to discover that there are alternative, more ethical, and most importantly, more fun ways to use and create the Internet for all of us.</p><p>The tools are here.

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Losing a child to suicide is unbelievable tragedy, and so, what description would weigh heavy enough to accurately describe losing both of your children this way? It is a rare, profound occurrence when a person is faced with such a life and decides to give us art, like this writing. I can only think of a handful of other titles which reckon with such loss in profundity, such as <em>Man's Search for Meaning</em> by Viktor Frankl or <em>First They Killed My Father</em> by Loung Un.</p><p>Suicide is one of the only things treated as a genuine infohazard in our society. We learn there is reckless danger and risk in discussing the topic, and that it spreads as social contagion. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24998511/">Research clearly shows this is a myth</a> and the opposite is true: talking about suicide reduces, rather than increase, suicidal ideation. Talking about things in the open leads to better mental health.</p><p>This matter-of-fact memoir is meant for Li's second son, James, who she consistently refers to as her son that thinks. This is in contrast to her first son, Vincent, the son that feels and for whom she wrote <em>Where Reasons End</em> for after he ended his own life. Vincent receives a fictional heartfelt novel, and James an autobiography of facts and truths. It is a dichotomy she returns to again and again: how life is comedy for those who think and life is tragedy for those who feel. She notes how James read Camus' <em>Myth of Sisphyus</em> shortly before his death. She wonders outloud how he may have thoughtfully, calmly even, decided to act simply after coming to the conclusion life was not livable. And he came to that conclusion on a Friday like any other Friday, after his Japanese undergrad class at university.</p><p>In a way, it can be said this book is anti-grief. Li considers grief as having an end-point, as though there could be a finite amount that can be felt when both of your children, all of your children, choose death instead of life. There is no end point—as she quotes Plath, there is only &quot;now and now and now&quot;, and Larkin, for &quot;where can we live but days&quot;? We endure the abyss only within the mundane, present moment. Another one of her mantras is that children die while parents simply go on living—in the abyss.</p><p>In that anti-grief, there is an emotional compartmentalization and detachment, which I would say is necessary for continuance. Li is stoic, having already found a way to continue after suffering severe abuse in her childhood. Li is a loving mother, and yet she could not save either of her only children. Having such an abusive mother herself, Li believed she was better off dead than to force her own children to suffer and endure a mother so mentally unwell. She writes about her own suicide attempt a few years before Vincent's death, causing her to be institutionalized for a period, and questions if her actions &quot;thinned the partition between life and death&quot; for her sons. There are other deep-wounded questions gnawing at Li throughout the book, despite how careful and persistent she is.</p><p>And what choice does she have? As she writes, life is stubborn, and we must be more stubborn. Distraction is at times the only alternative to being pulled into the unlivability of life. One thing I deeply appreciate is that Li is both an author and a professor of creative writing at university, and she explicitly states how naive somebody has to be to think writing is difficult. Writing is not difficult, living is.</p><p>So, how does she reckon? It is really a question we must all ask ourselves: how do we reckon with this life? With this world that's so full of pain and suffering? Intellectualization is both an impressive talent and a maladaptive coping mechanism. There was far more thinking than feeling during my own suicide attempt in May of 2025, when I secretly ended up in an emergency room getting my stomach pumped. Though I have not endured tragedy anywhere close to Li, I have found myself in a similar position to her: I am persisting. I am, as Anishinaabe theorist Gerald Vizenor coined, survivance. And I think it is important to note that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6982559/">90% of medically-serious attempt survivors do not attempt again</a>. Ideation of escape and the totality faced at death are two radically different things. Life, waywardly, is worth it.</p><p>There is no neat conclusion of hope or revelation to be found. We are always in the process, and in the now. Near the end of the book, Li (rightfully) chastises others who write to her to express sympathies, but in reality try to centre themselves in her grief. Those who attempted to send her their manuscripts and asked for tips for finding a publisher shortly after she lost her children. Or others who tell her of a religious or spiritual silver lining to her situation. There is none. There is only the present moment, where things simply continue, and where things in nature merely grow.</p>

    <description>A manifesto on what we do when the world is on fire: Daywriting. The deliberate, daily documentation of ordinary existence as both personal archive and political resistance.</description>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The title of my honours thesis back in university was &quot;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388769322_HOW_THE_ENGLISH_DEGREE_WILL_SAVE_THE_WORLD_Queering_Decolonizing_and_Democratizing_Literary_Studies_for_Generation_Z">HOW THE ENGLISH DEGREE WILL SAVE THE WORLD</a>&quot;. I wrote about Queering, decolonizing and democratizing literary studies for Generation Z. My Pilot G-2 pen writing frantically on ruled paper, coffee rings blooming across the margins.</p><p>An overly-bold and arrogant title, I know. The sort of title you write at 2am when your desk lamp is the only light left in the building. My justification was that I saw far too many undergraduates, and even postgrads, hedge. Too modest and meek to stand up and triumphantly state themselves and their work. Voices dropping to whispers in seminar rooms, eyes fixed on scuffed linoleum floors, shoulders curved inward like closing parentheses.</p><p>During my writing, I ended up adding an autoethnographic section—this is a fancy academic term that simply means a research method where a researcher analyzes their personal experiences (auto) to understand broader cultural, social, or political meanings. A first-person account (not very different from creative nonfiction or a blog post, really) which stands as a waypoint for discovering and articulating something important.</p><p>In this, I coined the term &quot;bloodwriting&quot;.</p><p><a href="https://blog.brennanbrown.ca/bloodwriting-58757b8722d5">I shared the excerpt on my Medium blog</a>. This is what I wrote about bloodwriting:</p><p>Bloodwriting begins with a pulse. The thrum of your fingers against keys. Flutters in your chest when your mouse hovers over &quot;publish&quot;. A quiet conviction that your words—whether they appear as Times New Roman 12pt or 280 characters in sans-serif blue on BlueSky or Threads or Mastodon—deserve to exist in the world. It's not craft or talent or clout. Bloodwriting is the courage to leave a mark, to say: <em>Hi, I am here, I think, I feel, I exist.</em></p><p>When our ancestors painted on cave walls, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517102-700-science-ancient-artists-painted-with-human-blood/">they mixed their own blood with the ochre</a> to make the images more powerful. More alive. Everything that matters costs us something of ourselves. Every time you open a blank document, post a thread, share a story online, you're creating a small altar to possibility.</p><hr /><p>What I want to write about here, instead, is what I'm going to call <strong>daywriting</strong>.</p><p>In 1953, Phillip Larkin wrote the following <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48410/days-56d229a0c0c33">poem</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>What are days for?</em><br /><em>Days are where we live.</em><br /><em>They come, they wake us</em><br /><em>Time and time over.</em><br /><em>They are to be happy in:</em><br /><em>Where can we live but days?</em></p></blockquote><p>I encountered this poem recently and I have been mulling over it extensively. It already follows the same thought pattern and throughline in which I find myself:</p><p>All we have are our days. We do not, and cannot, live in grand moments or holidays or the climaxes of memories. Our brain, though, does an excellent job of curating memory and causing us to believe otherwise.</p><p>So, I've decided what I'm calling for here is daywriting: <strong>the deliberate, daily documentation of ordinary existence as both personal archive and political resistance.</strong> The accumulation of days—<em>your</em> days, documented in <em>your</em> words—is how we fight erasure and cultivate joy.</p><p>Daywriting is the daily practice of documenting your ordinary existence as an act of resistance and cultural preservation. Unlike bloodwriting's courageous mark-making in public, daywriting is the quiet, consistent archiving of the mundane.</p><p>Your neighbor's recipe, a conversation transcribed verbatim, the texture of hoarfrost on your window. <a href="https://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/archiving-activism-in-the-digital-age/">Archiving as activism</a>, creating what researcher Michelle Caswell calls &quot;liberatory potential through widespread technologies&quot; like the internet and word-processing software. Daywriting isn't about saving the world, rather it's about ensuring <em>your world</em> isn't erased.</p><p><a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/news/call-abstracts-2024-cdcs-symposium-everyday-forms-digital-activism-and-resistance">Countless people engage in mundane activism and resistance which contribute to collective wellbeing</a>, yet their contributions aren't fully recognized. To capture and chronicle when we feel unheard, reclaiming our agency through narrative. Scholar Rowen White shares this sentiment:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://rowenwhite.substack.com/p/journaling-as-resistance">Writing in times of duress is resistance</a>.</p></blockquote><p>There are many people who would say we live in far too interesting of times right now. Just yesterday, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/venezuela-trump-maduro-captured-attack-new-york-live-updates-b2894099.html">United States declared that it will 'run' Venezuela after President Nicolás Maduro was kidnapped</a> and taken to New York. I read while making coffee, my screen too bright in morning gray light, my thumb scrolling, scrolling.</p><p>And this is only a few days after over <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-drones-missiles-pound-ukraine-before-zelenskiy-trump-meeting-2025-12-27/">500 Russian drones and missiles attacked Ukraine's capital, Kyiv</a>. Each notification a small electric shock, each headline a stone added to an already impossible weight.</p><p>I understand, it can feel as though we no longer have days. No longer have simple mundane life. The gears of the status quo are collapsing in front of our eyes in real-time. And I know my own position here, what I try to tell you on my soapbox. It seems futile and absurd, maybe even arrogant and delusional.</p><p>But outside your bedroom, right now, the tree branches are encased in hoarfrost. Nobody is on the road at 7AM on January's first Sunday. The stray cat is curled under your neighbor's porch, and the squirrel is nested in oak tree hollows lined with shredded newspaper. The days still go on. Steam still rises from your coffee. Your breath still fogs the window. The radiator still clanks and hisses.</p><p>We persist. And our persistence is as absurd as our existence is itself. Billions of people around the world still work. Punching time clocks with calloused thumbs, stacking boxes in warehouses. Still cooking meals, chopping onions and scraping burned bits from cast iron pans, still measuring rice with the same chipped measuring cup their mother used. Still loving, still kissing foreheads before work, still holding hands on cold walks, still saving the last bite of dessert.</p><p>We persist and we resist. The act of being able to stay creative, the act of giving, the act of surrendering our rugged individualism for the sake of a broader community in solidarity will keep us moving forward.</p><h2 id="the-archive-as-resistance" tabindex="-1">The Archive as Resistance <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-archive-as-resistance" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>I ask you to daywrite. To keep track of what happens to you. You don't need to be an artist, you don't need to save anybody. You just need to have an archive of your existence.</p><p>The concept of autonomous archiving has become <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10502-023-09416-8">a significant part of the activist toolkit itself</a>. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01576895.2018.1468273">Community archives give marginalized populations an active role in creating cultural memory</a>, like the participatory South Asian American Digital Archive where contributors upload and contextualize records from personal collections.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the collection and archiving of personal narratives and artifacts contributed to documenting and preserving historical experiences. Your daywriting is part of this lineage, <a href="https://commonslibrary.org/activist-archiving-start-here/">the archiving efforts of those who came before help us learn from social movement history</a>.</p><p>Jot down events you want to go to, transcribe conversations with neighbours-turned-friends. Start an index card collection of struggle meal recipes. Keep an idea list of ways you can support even when you're low on cash and energy.</p><p><a href="https://qz.com/259730/lifes-mundane-moments-can-later-bring-unexpected-joy">There is real value in capturing life's mundane, everyday experiences</a>, and documentation of these moments can bring us &quot;unexpected joy&quot; in the future. The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09548963.2016.1204044">&quot;turn to the quotidian&quot;</a> is a theoretical move to reemphasize the sometimes mundane domain of the everyday, concentrating on lived experience. Kayti Christian pointedly wrote, <a href="https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/simple-things/">life is 99% mundane</a>. A person's life is a collection of all the moments that happen in the middle.</p><h2 id="how-to-start-daywriting" tabindex="-1">How to Start Daywriting <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#how-to-start-daywriting" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Let me give you specific, actionable ways to begin:</p><p><strong>The 100-Word Daily:</strong> Open Notepad or TextEdit. Set a timer for 3 minutes. Write 100 words about today. Not polished. Just: &quot;Woke at 6:47am. Cat knocked over water glass. Bread was moldy. Took last $8 to laundromat. Woman there helped me fold sheets even though we didn't speak same language. Her hands smelled like lavender. Trump announced [something]. Felt afraid. Made rice and eggs. Watched neighbor's kid draw with sidewalk chalk, they drew a house with 8 windows. Saved the photo.&quot; This is your archive. This is daywriting.</p><p><strong>Sunday Evening Inventory:</strong> Every Sunday at dusk, while the streetlights flicker on and the neighbourhood settles into that pre-work quiet, open a document called <code>2026-weeks.md</code>. Write three bullet points:</p><ul><li>Something you learned from a conversation (exact words if possible: &quot;Mrs. Rodriguez said her tomatoes won't grow anymore because the frost comes too early now&quot;)</li><li>One mundane object that defined your week (the chipped blue mug, the grocery receipt folded in your pocket, the sound of your radiator clicking on)</li><li>A small act of resistance or care you witnessed (neighbour's porch light left on all night, someone leaving books in the Little Free Library)</li></ul><p><strong>Monthly Recipe Swaps on the IndieWeb:</strong> The last Sunday of each month, post one &quot;struggle meal&quot; recipe to your omg.lol blog—real costs, real prep time, real substitutions. Tag it #strugglemealsolidarity. Link to other people's recipes. This isn't Instagram food porn. This is documentation of survival: &quot;Lentil soup: $3.47. One onion, bag of lentils, bouillon cube. Lasted 4 days. Tasted like my grandmother's kitchen.&quot;</p><p><strong>The Resistance-When-Tired List:</strong> Start a plain text file called <code>resistance-when-tired.txt</code>. In it, list small acts: &quot;Share mutual aid posts while coffee cools. Text check-ins during lunch break. Keep granola bars in coat pocket for unhoused neighbors.&quot; Number each line. Layer by layer, a stratum of care is created which costs nothing but attention.</p><h2 id="the-democratic-web" tabindex="-1">The Democratic Web <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-democratic-web" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Think of old GeoCities archives on mechanical hard drives. GeoCities, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">began in 1994 and by 1999 was reportedly the third-most-visited website on the World Wide Web</a>, was <a href="https://cybercultural.com/p/geocities-1995/">one of the first commercial internet services to make it easy for people to publish home pages</a>.</p><p>While these sites are regarded only as amateur creations, they were the first flowering of truly democratic digital literature. Anyone could share anything with anyone. Effortlessly. Free. Buried among the animated GIFs and comic sans were blog posts from the late 90s. Raw, sometimes-bizarre thoughts from people who weren't trying to build personal brands or monetize existence.</p><p>I'm reminded of Justin's Links from the Underground, one of the earliest personal websites launched in 1994 by Justin Hall. While early websites like his are now often dismissed as amateur, they were among the first flowering of truly democratic digital literature. Anyone could share anything with anyone. Effortlessly. Free. Justin chronicled his life in intimate detail long before the term &quot;blog&quot; even existed. In an interview, he said:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://worldhatchlearning.wordpress.com/2018/09/22/justin-hall-and-the-origins-of-blogs-on-the-internet/">&quot;The best use of our technology enhances our humanity. It lets us shape our narrative and share our story and connect us.&quot;</a></p></blockquote><p>Internet artist Olia Lialina notes that <a href="https://blog.geocities.institute/archives/6418">the point about the web before social networks wasn't that you had a profile on GeoCities</a>, but that you had a chance to build your cyber home outside of it. When Yahoo shut down GeoCities in October 2009, millions of pages disappeared overnight. <a href="https://www.headcountcoffee.com/blogs/corporate-legends-lost-empires/geocities-and-the-vanishing-neighborhoods-of-the-early-web">The disappearance</a> marked a shift where personal ownership gave way to centralized platforms, and creative messiness was replaced by standardized templates.</p><h2 id="joy-as-resistance" tabindex="-1">Joy as Resistance <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#joy-as-resistance" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Our greatest weapon has been, and always will be, our collective imagination. If we are able to be clever enough, if we are able to maneuver these marked number days with grace and intelligent determination, we will make it back to the boring. To a stability where we no longer have to choose between food and medicine and rent. Where identity and love will no longer be legislated.</p><p>But we also need joy. Dear God, we need joy.</p><p>adrienne maree brown's concept of <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/pleasure-activism-protest-movements-joy-resistance-political-framework-audre-lorde">&quot;pleasure activism&quot;</a> centres joy as a political framework, asserting that we all need and deserve pleasure, and that enjoyment gives us energy to bring about social change. Activist Shamillah Wilson writes that <a href="https://shamillahwilson.com/claiming-joy-as-an-act-of-resistance/">making space for joy opposes the pervasive imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchal ideology</a> that puts pressure on us to constantly produce. <a href="https://aestheticsofjoy.com/joy-is-an-act-of-resistance-how-celebration-sustains-activism-2/">The pursuit of joy amid great struggle is a way to tend our humanity</a> when it is most threatened.</p><p>Historian Kellie Carter Jackson found that during slavery, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/26/nx-s1-5646642/nprs-code-switch-joy-as-resistance">enslaved women would sometimes go deep into forests and throw dance parties</a> as a way to remind themselves they are fully human.</p><p>We need to have a space, both in our real lives and digitally, for silliness. For the ability to frolic and find merry and whimsy. Your call for silliness, frolic, and whimsy <em>is</em> survival.</p><h2 id="building-our-own-spaces" tabindex="-1">Building Our Own Spaces <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#building-our-own-spaces" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>You are probably glued to your phone every single day. That's okay. That's by their design. I'm not asking you for abstinence, I'm asking you to seek alternatives. Build and create instead of consume. Move from the siloed corporate social media platforms of Meta or the Nazi bar of X to the indieweb, to neocities and omg.lol.</p><p>In my recent article about <a href="https://blog.brennanbrown.ca/omg-lol-is-the-internet-we-need-right-now-3538199d5dea">omg.lol</a>, I explained <em>what</em> tools exist for reclaiming your digital space. Daywriting explains <em>why</em> we need them. <a href="https://indieweb.org/">The IndieWeb is based on principles</a> of owning your domain, publishing on your own site first, and owning your content. As one IndieWeb advocate notes, <a href="https://techplanet.today/post/the-personal-web-renaissance-how-individual-websites-are-fighting-corporate-internet-monopolies">when you own your domain and host your content</a>, no corporation can delete your work, change the rules, or hold your audience hostage.</p><p>Create your own shit, share it with others. These are the first steps towards not just organizing for a better future, but to nurture and cultivate joy.</p><p>I'm somebody who is stern, who can be regarded as cold when I am faced with conflict. But this is simply not who I am. I am one of the least serious people you'll meet. In my day-to-day life, I pull pranks, I am plain goofy, and I make awful jokes. I am trying to colour the web with that more. Join me?</p><hr /><p>Tomorrow morning, the hoarfrost will have melted. But you will have written down that it was there. That you saw it. That you existed in that specific moment on that specific Sunday in January 2026. That is daywriting. That is resistance.</p>

    <description>The lyrics &#39;You know the greatest films of all time were never made&#39; is obviously not about films. It is, somehow, about how we’re living on this planet for a fragile, finite amount of time and we have something inert within us to give, to gift. </description>

Prelude <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#i-prelude" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>The film canisters sit in a climate-controlled vault somewhere in Munich. A shot list is composed with over 450 camera positions. An hour of experimental colour tests performed, the film stock whirring through the camera, light and shadow dancing exactly as imagined.</p><p>This is all that remains of <a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/greatest-movies-never-made-alfred-hitchcocks-kaleidoscope/">Alfred Hitchcock's unmade film</a><em>Kaleidoscope.</em> The master of suspense was reduced to tears when Universal executives, disgusted by the script, cancelled the project in 1968. The tests are said to be beautiful. The film would have revolutionized cinema technique. We'll never see it.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lost_films"><em>London After Midnight</em></a>, starring Lon Chaney in 1927, now considered the &quot;holy grail&quot; of lost films, destroyed in the 1965 MGM vault fire along with hundreds of others, the silver nitrate burning at temperatures that could liquefy bone. <a href="https://paleofuture.com/blog/2014/7/2/roughly-90-of-movies-made-before-1929-are-lost-forever">Over 90% of films made before 1929</a> are gone forever. Think about that. Ninety percent. Not locked away in some archive—<em>gone</em>. Turned to smoke and ash. All those faces moving in lamplight, all those stories whispered in title cards, reduced to nothing.</p><p>And that's just the films that were made and lost. What about the ones never even filmed?</p><p>In 1942, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls073356642/">Andrei Tarkovsky began adapting Dostoevsky's <em>The Idiot</em></a>. He died before it could be realized. <a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/a-failed-rock-adaption-of-dune-might">Alejandro Jodorowsky's <em>Dune</em></a>, which would have featured Salvador Dalí, Orson Welles, Mick Jagger, with a soundtrack by Pink Floyd was killed before production began. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/13/stanley-kubrick-napoleon-philip-french">Stanley Kubrick spent two years researching <em>Napoleon</em></a>, amassing 15,000 location-scouting photographs, 17,000 slides of Napoleonic imagery, historical advisors from Oxford. The studios wouldn't fund it. Too big. Too expensive. Historical epics were out of fashion at the time.</p><p>Then there's the yellow-tinted basement of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, where <a href="https://dc.law.utah.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1320&amp;context=ulr">Jewish prisoners' artwork sits in filing cabinets</a>, claimed as property of the institution rather than the murdered artists who created them. Woodcuts made on New Year's Eve 1942. Sheet music composed in the Terezin ghetto. Plays performed in secret before the gas chambers. <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nazi-propaganda-and-censorship">Julo Levin was a highly regarded artist until 1933</a>, when the Nazis arrested him and forbade him to show his work publicly. Forced to instead work as a handyman at the train yard, he cleaned the blood from the wagons returning empty from the east.</p><p>How many other works have died in the thousand small violences of &quot;no&quot;?</p><h2 id="ii-the-lyric" tabindex="-1">ii. The Lyric <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#ii-the-lyric" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Yes, these are what I think about when I listen to Taylor Swift's &quot;the one&quot; from _Folklore _(her best album). There's a line that's been lodged in my skull like a splinter:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZ6tROaVOQ">&quot;You know the greatest films of all time were never made.&quot;</a></p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-the-one-annotated">correct interpretation of this line</a>, according to <em>Genius</em> annotations, is about relationships. How the best love stories, like unmade movies, remain forever shelved, &quot;trapped in the mythology of this idea.&quot; Swift is mourning a lost connection, trapped in romantic fantasy wondering what could have been.</p><p>But my brain, stubborn as always, refused the metaphor. It chewed on the words themselves, rolling them around like a stone in a shoe. I took it literally. What films <em>have</em> we missed?</p><p>How many would-be filmmakers never touched a camera? How many poets died with their best lines still unwritten? How many painters never picked up a brush because they were too busy surviving, because they were born in the wrong body or the wrong country or the wrong century, because someone told them no so many times that eventually they told themselves no? What creation is the world missing?</p><h2 id="iii-the-gift-of-creation" tabindex="-1">iii. The Gift of Creation <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#iii-the-gift-of-creation" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>In <a href="https://lewishyde.com/the-gift/"><em>The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World</em></a>, poet and essayist <a href="https://www.rabbitroom.com/post/art-is-a-gift-not-a-commodity-on-lewis-hyde-s-the-gift">Lewis Hyde writes</a>, <em>&quot;that a work of art is a gift, not a commodity. Or, to state the modern case with more precision, that works of art exist simultaneously in two 'economies,' a market economy and a gift economy. Only one of these is essential, however: a work of art can survive without the market, but where there is no gift there is no art.&quot;</em></p><p>Margaret Atwood, in her introduction to the 2019 edition, calls <em>The Gift</em><a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/09/16/the-gift-of-lewis-hydes-the-gift/">&quot;the one book I recommend without fail to aspiring writers and painters and musicians.&quot;</a> It explains &quot;the core nature of what it is that artists do, and also about the relation of these activities to our overwhelmingly commercial society.&quot;</p><p>Hyde draws on Indigenous potlatch ceremonies, where goods were given away until the giver was hollowed out. He examines Walt Whitman's erotic generosity, his willingness to dissolve the boundary between self and other. He warns us, through Ezra Pound's descent into fascism, what happens when the artist becomes obsessed with market forces distorting their work. <a href="https://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-the-gift-creativity-and-the-artist-in-the-modern-world/">The central thesis</a> is that <em>moving</em> art—the art capable of reviving the soul, delighting the senses, and offering courage for living—is received as a gift, regardless of whether we paid admission at the museum door.</p><h2 id="iv-gamble-of-the-harvest" tabindex="-1">iv. Gamble of the Harvest <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#iv-gamble-of-the-harvest" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>When _I _create something, most of what comes out is unremarkable. Forgettable. I know this. Most of it won't be cherished by anybody or remembered fondly. My poems aren't Dickinson. My essays aren't Annie Dillard. My code won't revolutionize anything.</p><p>But I keep doing it. I keep going. I keep getting a little better. I keep building and improving and planting seeds in the garden—some will sprout, most will rot, and that's fine. That's the gamble of the harvest. That's the deal.</p><p>At some point, in a long while, there will be something of worth. I will eventually create something great. And I say this not from ego or delusion, but from pure mathematics. You apply overwhelming force and don't let up. You play chicken with your own doubts. Risk it all. The law of large numbers says that eventually, if you make enough things, one of them will be good. A few might be very good. And if you're lucky—if you're blessed—one might be great.</p><p>This is what I mean by <em>the civic duty of the artist</em>.</p><p>If anything, this goes beyond mere civility. We need to do everything in our power to let ourselves create because that's the point. Everything else,<em>the day job, the survival, the performance of productivity,</em> all of it is secondary to what we can passionately do, given enough time and effort.</p><p>It is a lot of work. It is probably the hardest work because it's what we're most psychologically barred from. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2302269120">The more important something is, the higher the stakes, the less likely we'll even start</a>. The reality of failure paralyzes us from the gate.</p><p>Or we tell ourselves that making art is antithetical to survival. And in the grinding logic of capitalism? It often is. It can sound as though I'm speaking from a position of delusional privilege. But here's the truth that all the great religious traditions recognize: man cannot live on bread alone. We need meaning and beauty. We need those moments when something lifts us out of ourselves.</p><p>Without art—without the gifts we give each other through our creations—we're just biological machines processing inputs and outputs until we break down. With it, we become something else. Something larger.</p><p>This is the ethos of my purpose. I've been writing on <a href="https://blog.brennanbrown.ca/">Medium</a> for ten years. Two hundred articles and counting across personal essays, literary criticism, Indigenous studies, disability representation, creative writing craft, digital minimalism. Most of it get double digits. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B0DQTPYKHD">I've self-published nine books</a>, poetry chapbooks, essay collections, memoir. I founded <a href="https://writeclub.ca/">Write Club</a>, a creative collective in Calgary that's raised funds for literacy nonprofits and created space for marginalized voices. I've built <a href="https://github.com/brennanbrown">20+ open-source coding projects</a>, Jekyll themes, Eleventy starters, static site generators. All of it freely given.</p><p>There's no money in this. It's probably one of the least lucrative ways I could be spending my time, measured in the currencies that supposedly matter. Dollars, followers, career advancement. I am not doing it for brownie points, either. I don't give a shit about salvation or redemption. I don't write because I think God is keeping score.</p><p>Art is gift, coming and going. It's a gift to the artist first, ask any creator about those moments when the work feels like it arrived from somewhere else, when the words pour out faster than you can type, when the solution to a problem appears fully formed in the shower. You didn't earn it exactly. You showed up, yes. You did the work. But the <em>good</em> parts, the parts that sing? Those feel gifted.</p><p>We are gift creatures. Our solidarity, our very humanity, comes from what we can give others.</p><h2 id="v-the-pattern" tabindex="-1">v. The Pattern <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#v-the-pattern" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Vincent van Gogh sold exactly <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/van-gogh-sold-only-one-painting-4050008">one painting during his lifetime</a>, to a close friend. Probably out of pity. He lived in grinding poverty with mental illness gnawing at him like rats in the walls. And he created nearly 1,000 works in his last two years. Today, his <em>Sunflowers</em> sells for $39.9 million. <em>Irises</em> for $53.9 million. Numbers that would have fed him for lifetimes. He dies at 37, a gunshot wound in a wheat field, never knowing.</p><p>Emily Dickinson published <a href="https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/emily-dickinson/poetry/">fewer than twelve poems while alive</a>. She wrote 1,800. She retreated from the world so completely that she would speak to visitors only from behind a closed door, her voice disembodied and ghostlike. The people of Amherst knew her mostly as legend, as the woman in white in the big house who never came out. Her poems were discovered in a locked chest after her death, tied in bundles with ribbon, each one a small bomb of compressed language that would detonate across the next century.</p><p>Vivian Maier was a full-time nanny, died in 2009. Her street photography work was found by accident at an auction, stored in boxes, never shown in any gallery while she lived. <a href="https://www.vivianmaier.com/about-maloof-collection/">Over 100,000 negatives.</a> Now her photographs hang in major museums. Critics compare her to Helen Levitt and Robert Frank. But she saw none of it. She died unknown.</p><p>The pattern repeats. The pattern repeats. And repeats. The pattern repeats until you can't ignore it. <em>We lose them</em>. We lose them because genius is fragile and the world is hard. Because making art requires time and space and faith, and those are luxuries most people can't afford. Because recognition often arrives too late, if at all.</p><h2 id="vi-2026-is-a-cultural-reset" tabindex="-1">vi. 2026 is a Cultural Reset <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#vi-2026-is-a-cultural-reset" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p><em>&quot;You know the greatest films of all time were never made</em>&quot; is obviously not about films. It is, somehow, about how we're living on this planet for a fragile, finite amount of time and we have something inert within us to give,_to gift. _We have skills, either by fluke or by hard, bloody-knuckle work. We owe it to ourselves and everyone else to cultivate those skills.</p><p>Not for recognition, or money. We do it because those unmade films haunt us. Because Vincent van Gogh should have lived to see people weeping in front of his paintings. Because Emily Dickinson should have known that her words would echo across centuries. Because every lost artist is a tragedy, yes, but also a warning_, This could be you. This could be me. This could be the person sitting next to you on the bus with a novel in their head they'll never write._</p><p>I refuse to be another ghost in that litany. I refuse to let fear or practicality or the sneering voice of &quot;realism&quot; silence what wants to be born through me.</p><p>This is what I'm trying to centre myself on for 2026. We're entering what feels like a cultural reset, a moment when we could tip toward darkness or tilt back toward light. To return to form. To trying. To a mustard seed of optimism that we can steer ourselves out of the apocalypse.</p><p>And you, reading this right now, are needed for this.</p><p>Not metaphorically. Not symbolically. You, specifically, with your particular gifts and strange obsessions and the things only you can make. We cannot have a bright, joyful future without you. I promise you that.</p><p>Because somewhere in you is something unmade. Maybe it's great. Maybe it's just good. Maybe it's weird and small and only three people will ever care about it. Make it anyway. Give the gift.</p><p>The world has lost too much already.</p>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>So, I have to first admit how bizarre this new year day is for me. I wanted to fight the Hogmanay! Never before have I begun a year with my resolutions already successfully underway. To start, I've completed an <a href="https://750words.com/person/brennan">entire year</a> of writing 750 words daily each day.</p><p>And then, starting around November, I began publishing a full-length article nearly each day as well. I also restarted my poetry blog and began posting a new poem daily.</p><p>In regards to coding, I updated a bunch of my previous projects and started a bunch of new ones. I founded a indie web dev. studio with my amazing partner Yvonne called <a href="https://berryhouse.ca/">🍓 Berry House</a> and finally created the IndieWeb personal site of my dreams, <a href="https://brennan.day/">brennan.day</a>.</p><p>All of this is to say, well, where do I go from here?</p><p>The answer will probably make you roll your eyes, but it's another coding/writing project.</p><p>One of the reasons writing is so important to me is because having a daily written record means that I don't forget things. It means that days have proof of existence and aren't entirely wasted. I archive and collect and curate my life for the sake of examination. I believe meaningfulness can only be derived from examination.</p><p>Since I've transitioned from daily private journal writing to daily public blog posts, I've put less focus on my consumption. On one hand, this is a good thing. I think we all consume too much, and I love how I've been in such a creative, creating mode.</p><p>But on the other hand, you can't really make good work without appreciating the good work of others and standing on the shoulders of giants. I do not want to stop reading books or watching films or listening to music. Rather, I want to make sure I am far more intentional and deliberate about my media choices.</p><p>I also want to, well, remember what I consume. I enjoy using Letterboxd and Storygraph to keep track of my film-watching and book-reading respectively, but there is a lot of friction and piecemeal in that approach.</p><p>More importantly, my habit of keeping a gratitude journal has fallen to the wayside. I believe this to be one of the most important habits a person can have. I have so much to be grateful for.</p><p>So, with all of this in mind, I've decided to create a stand-alone project I'm calling my commonplace log and gratitude journal. It will live at <a href="https://log.brennan.day/">https://log.brennan.day</a> and will mostly just be for my own sake.</p><p>One of the biggest reasons I decided to make another site/project is because I'm a Beeminder zealot. I absolutely love the service and I make use of it a lot. (I actually have a tattoo of their logo, but that's a story for another blog post).</p><p>Beeminder has syncing service called <a href="https://doc.beeminder.com/gitminder">GitMinder</a>, which allows you to track the commits pushed to a specific repository on GitHub (and if you don't, you pay cold hard cash). Back in the day, you could keep track of all the commits you push, but GitHub changed their API so now it's repo-only. Which is actually great! This means that now I can hold myself accountable to ensuring I write out what I'm grateful for every day, and it will remove the friction of jotting down any media I've consumed or specific things I want to make note of.</p><p>So, this was my original napkin spec sheet of the site:</p><blockquote><ul><li>An ultra simple brutalist 11ty blog called &quot;daily gratitude&quot;, at the repo <a href="https://github.com/brennanbrown/commonplace">commonplace</a>.</li><li>Extremely simple, no CSS framework, monospace web fonts, etc.</li><li>Extremely accessible as well, good-looking on desktop and mobile without any responsive design</li><li>Homepage will render the date and note of gratitude of that day, it will be more like microblogging, so no titles, tags, images, etc.</li><li>Each month of posts grouped.</li><li>In addition to gratitude, I think it would be fun to also use this daily microblogging to track what I consume (books, videos, music), locations I go, quotes, anything else like that like a commonplace book.</li><li>Each type of data /media tracked has its own emoji/colour, and they're all optional.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Now, with all that out of the way, let's get into the technicalities of the site. Of course you might be thinking that a project this simple wouldn't need a technical write-up, I did too when I first started writing out the spec sheet. But oh my God, I was totally wrong.</p><h2 id="the-deceptively-simple-spec-sheet" tabindex="-1">The Deceptively Simple Spec Sheet <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-deceptively-simple-spec-sheet" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>I began with Eleventy because I've been using it more and more, and it seemed like the perfect tool for this. Static site generator, supports Nunjucks templates, excellent for blogs. What could go wrong?</p><p>Well, I found myself going down a rabbit hole of timezone bugs, Nunjucks template escaping issues, and collection sorting headscratchers.</p><p>I scaffolded out a basic structure:</p><pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">src/ _includes/ base.njk post.njk posts/ 2025-01-01.md 2025-01-02.md index.njk css/ style.css</code></pre><p>Each post would be a simple markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing all the different types of data I wanted to track:</p><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token punctuation">---</span><span class="token key atrule">date</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token datetime number">2025-01-02</span><span class="token key atrule">gratitude</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token string">"The silence of early morning before anyone else is awake is precious."</span><span class="token key atrule">books</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token punctuation">-</span><span class="token key atrule">title</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token string">"The Dispossessed"</span><span class="token key atrule">author</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token string">"Ursula K.

The Beeminder integration would work by me committing a new markdown file each day.</p><h2 id="html-escaping" tabindex="-1">HTML Escaping <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#html-escaping" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>The first issue hit me when I tried to render the posts on the homepage. Everything was showing up as plain text. Not styled text, but literally the raw HTML tags were visible on the page. Angle brackets everywhere. It looked like I was teaching an HTML 101 class.</p><p>The culprit was Nunjucks' default behaviour of escaping HTML for security. Which is great when you're dealing with user input, but not so great when you're trying to render your own templates. The fix was adding the <code>| safe</code> filter to the content in the base layout:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>main</span><span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>main<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span> {{ content | safe }}<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>main</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><p>Static site generators are secure by default, which means you need to explicitly tell them when you trust your own content.</p><h2 id="timezone-shenanigans" tabindex="-1">Timezone Shenanigans <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#timezone-shenanigans" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>I'd create a post dated <code>2025-01-02</code>, but it would show up on the homepage as January 1st. Or worse, it would show up in the wrong month entirely in the archives. December posts were appearing in November.</p><p>The issue? JavaScript's <code>Date</code> object was interpreting my YAML dates as local time and then converting them based on my timezone. Since I'm in a negative UTC timezone, dates were being shifted backward. A post from January 2nd at midnight was becoming January 1st at 1 PM the previous day. This is a known <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/dates/#dates-off-by-one-day">pitfall</a> in the 11ty docs. RTFM.</p><p>The solution required two fixes:</p><p>First, parse all dates as UTC by appending the timezone:</p><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">const</span> date <span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token keyword">new</span><span class="token class-name">Date</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>dateObj <span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token string">'T00:00:00Z'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><p>Second, use string comparison instead of date math for sorting:</p><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">sort</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">a<span class="token punctuation">,</span> b</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">=></span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token keyword">return</span><span class="token function">String</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>b<span class="token punctuation">.</span>data<span class="token punctuation">.</span>date<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">localeCompare</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">String</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">.</span>data<span class="token punctuation">.</span>date<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre><p>Even with these fixes, I hit another timezone snag. When grouping posts by month, January 1st was showing up in December 2024! The issue was that <code>date.getFullYear()</code> and <code>date.getMonth()</code> were still converting to local time. The final solution was to use UTC methods explicitly:</p><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">const</span> utcYear <span class="token operator">=</span> date<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">getUTCFullYear</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token keyword">const</span> utcMonth <span class="token operator">=</span> date<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">getUTCMonth</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token keyword">const</span> monthKey <span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token template-string"><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span><span class="token interpolation"><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">${</span>utcYear<span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token string">-</span><span class="token interpolation"><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">${</span><span class="token function">String</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>utcMonth <span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">padStart</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token string">'0'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span></span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><p>Moral of the story: when working with dates in JavaScript, use UTC everywhere or prepare for timezone pain.</p><h2 id="collections" tabindex="-1">Collections <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#collections" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>I wanted the homepage to show the latest post in full, and then monthly archives for everything else. Sounds simple. Eleventy has a great collections system. I wrote a custom collection:</p><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">eleventyConfig<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">addCollection</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"latest"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">collectionApi</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token keyword">return</span> collectionApi <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">getFilteredByGlob</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"src/posts/**/*.md"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">sort</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">a<span class="token punctuation">,</span> b</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">=></span><span class="token function">String</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>b<span class="token punctuation">.</span>data<span class="token punctuation">.</span>date<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">localeCompare</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">String</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">.</span>data<span class="token punctuation">.</span>date<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">slice</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><p>But my <code>collections.all</code> was returning 3 items when I only had 2 posts. Turns out, Eleventy was including the <a href="cci:7://file:///Users/brennan/Documents/GitHub/commonplace/src/index.njk:0:0-0:0">index.njk</a> file itself as a collection item. The fix was to be more specific with glob patterns and filter more carefully.</p><p>I also needed to group posts by month, which meant creating another custom collection:</p><pre

The posts weren't using any layout template.</p><p>I had to create a dedicated post layout <code>_includes/post.njk</code> and then add <code>layout: ../_includes/post.njk</code> to each post's frontmatter. But the layout needed to access the frontmatter data differently than I expected.</p><p>In the homepage template, I could access a post as <code>post.data.gratitude</code>. But in the individual post layout, the data is available directly as <code>gratitude</code>.

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>As I've <a href="https://blog.brennanbrown.ca/move-to-a-better-internet-in-2026-8ab3d36bae20">already written about before</a>, I love NeoCities. It is a free web hosting service embarcing the spirit of the early web, taking its name from the tragically-defunct <a href="https://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/">GeoCities</a>.</p><p>For the sake of ease, I'm currently hosting my site with <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, but I thought it would be a fun side quest to use GitLab's CI/CD pipeline to upload the rendered <code>_site</code> output of my static site to NeoCities via their API. Easy enough, right?</p><p>There were several reasons I wanted to try this. First, it would be a handy backup, particularly for someone like me who's trying to follow the <a href="https://www.veeam.com/blog/321-backup-rule.html">3-2-1 rule</a>. I would also just love to join the community, and maybe in the future I'll create a site that's specifically created for NeoCities rather than just a mirror.</p><p>The service also has a generous free tier! 1 GB of storage and 200 GB of bandwidth, with no server management or any sort of complex configuration. You just drag-and-drop files and they're hosted. (Or remotely upload the files, in my case.)</p><p>There <em>are</em> limitations, of course, particularly with filetypes. I'll get into that.</p><p>So, this was ultimately my plan:</p><ol><li>Automatically deploy my 11ty site to NeoCities with each commit</li><li>Support multiple authentication methods (username/password or API key)</li><li>Only upload modified files to ensure no wasted bandwidth</li><li>Filter out any unsupported file types automatically</li><li>Ensure robust error-handling and logging</li></ol><p>Although, number five happened organically due to how many times I messed up and had no idea why. I am a <em>really</em> good web developer, I swear.</p><p>Here's the <strong>full</strong><a href="https://gitlab.com/brennankbrown/brennan.day/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml"><code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code></a> handling everything. It ended up rather extensive and lengthy. Everything below will be referencing this script.</p><h2 id="the-neocities-api" tabindex="-1">The NeoCities API <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#the-neocities-api" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>NeoCities provides a REST API with two authentication methods:</p><h3 id="1-basic-authentication-username-password" tabindex="-1">1.

The complete list includes:</p><pre><code>apng asc atom avif bin cjs css csv dae eot epub geojson gif glb glsl gltf gpg htm html ico jpeg jpg js json jxl key kml knowl less manifest map markdown md mf mid midi mjs mtl obj opml osdx otf pdf pgp pls png py rdf resolveHandle rss sass scss sf2 svg text toml ts tsv ttf txt webapp webmanifest webp woff woff2 xcf xml yaml yml</code></pre><p>Files like <code>.pf_fragment</code>, <code>.pf_meta</code>, and <code>.wasm</code> (generated by Pagefind for my site's search) are <strong>not</strong> supported on free accounts.</p><h2 id="setting-up-environment-variables" tabindex="-1">Setting Up Environment Variables <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#setting-up-environment-variables" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>First, add your credentials to GitLab CI/CD variables (Settings → CI/CD → Variables):</p><ul><li><code>NEOCITIES_USERNAME</code></li><li><code>NEOCITIES_PASSWORD</code></li><li><code>NEOCITIES_API_KEY</code></li></ul><p>Mark these as <strong>Masked</strong> for security.</p><h2 id="when-deployments-run" tabindex="-1">When Deployments Run <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#when-deployments-run" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>One thing I learned the hard way is that you don't always want to deploy every single file. After some trial and error (mostly error), I set up three triggers for the pipeline:</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic</strong>: Every commit to the main branch (since that's usually when I've actually fixed something)</li><li><strong>Manual</strong>: You can trigger it from GitLab's web interface - handy for those &quot;oops, I need to push that again&quot; moments</li><li><strong>Forced full deploy</strong>: Set <code>FORCE_FULL_DEPLOY=true</code> when you need to upload everything (great for first-time setup or when things get weird)</li></ul><p>For the very first deployment, the script uploads ALL supported files. This makes sense since you can't upload &quot;modified&quot; files when there's nothing there yet! The same thing happens for manual triggers or when you force a full deploy.</p><h2 id="how-it-figures-out-what-to-upload" tabindex="-1">How It Figures Out What to Upload <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#how-it-figures-out-what-to-upload" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Eleventy builds your <code>src/</code> folder into <code>_site/</code>, but Git tracks changes in <code>src/</code>. The script needs to map between these! It does this by simply stripping the <code>src/</code> prefix from file paths.</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Remove src/ prefix if it exists</span><span class="token keyword">if</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">"<span class="token variable">$file</span>"</span><span class="token operator">==</span> src/* <span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token keyword">then</span><span class="token assign-left variable">built_file</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"<span class="token variable">${file<span class="token operator">#</span>src<span class="token operator">/</span>}</span>"</span><span class="token keyword">else</span><span class="token assign-left variable">built_file</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"<span class="token variable">$file</span>"</span><span class="token keyword">fi</span></code></pre><p>The script also gives you way more debug output than you probably need:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">DEBUG: Modified <span class="token builtin class-name">source</span> files:src/posts/my-new-post.mdsrc/assets/css/new-style.cssDEBUG: New <span class="token builtin class-name">source</span> files:src/images/cat-photo.jpgDEBUG: Files to upload after mapping:posts/my-new-post.mdassets/css/new-style.cssimages/cat-photo.jpg</code></pre><p>It even counts how many files it's about to upload, which is satisfying to see in the logs.</p><h2 id="gitlab-ci-extras" tabindex="-1">GitLab CI Extras <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#gitlab-ci-extras" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Since we're using GitLab, there are a couple of nice-to-have features I enabled. These don't affect the deployment itself:</p><ul><li><strong>Artifacts</strong>: The <code>_site</code> folder gets saved, so you can download the built site if needed</li><li><strong>Environment</strong>: GitLab tracks this as a &quot;production&quot; environment with your NeoCities URL</li></ul><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#features" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>The script tries username/password first, then falls back to the API key to provide robustness. The <code>test_auth</code> function validates credentials before attempting upload, and provides error messages if authentication fails.</p><p>Both <code>jq</code> (if available) and <code>grep</code> patterns are used to parse JSON responses, handing variations in whitespace and formatting:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Flexible grep pattern allows for whitespace</span><span class="token function">grep</span><span class="token parameter variable">-q</span><span class="token string">'"result":[[:space:]]*"success"'</span></code></pre><p>Only modified files are uploaded after the first deployment. This speeds up deployments from minutes to seconds:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Get changed files between commits</span><span class="token function">git</span><span class="token function">diff</span> --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD</code></pre><p>The regex automatically filters to only supported file types, preventing errors from trying to upload things like the Pagefind search index files and anything else unsupported:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">grep</span><span class="token parameter variable">-E</span><span class="token string">"\.(<span class="token variable">$SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS</span>)$"</span></code></pre><h2 id="error-handling" tabindex="-1">Error Handling <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#error-handling" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>When things go wrong, the script tries outputting useful information. For authentication failures, it extracts the actual error message from NeoCities:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">Error type: invalid_authMessage: Invalid username or password</code></pre><p>One particularly helpful debug feature shows just enough of your API key to verify it's correct without exposing the whole thing:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">API Key length: <span class="token number">64</span> charactersFirst <span class="token number">8</span> chars: abcd1234<span class="token punctuation">..</span>.Last <span class="token number">8</span> chars: <span class="token punctuation">..</span>.efgh5678</code></pre><p>The script also uses Node.js 18 in the Docker image, which matters if you're using newer JavaScript features in your build process.</p><h2 id="drawbacks" tabindex="-1">Drawbacks <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#drawbacks" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>As it can be seen from above, certain features don't work with this mirror, such as the search and contact form. In the future, I might create a separate branch for a NeoCities-friendly version of the site that doesn't automatically mirror any broken functionality. But I think this is good enough, for now.</p><h2 id="debugging-parsing-errors" tabindex="-1">Debugging Parsing Errors <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#debugging-parsing-errors" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Curl's progress meter ended up interfering with response parsing, so I used <code>-sS</code> flags and reted stderr:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">curl</span><span class="token parameter variable">-sS</span><span class="token parameter variable">-w</span><span class="token string">"<span class="token entity" title="\n">\n</span>HTTP_CODE:%{http_code}"</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">..</span>.<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token operator"><span class="token file-descriptor important">2</span>></span>/dev/null</code></pre><p>In addition, storing curl flags in variables causes word splitting issues. We can use conditional curl commands directly instead of storing flags:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token keyword">if</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">"<span class="token variable">$method</span>"</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"Username/Password"</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token keyword">then</span><span class="token assign-left variable">response</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token variable"><span class="token variable">$(</span><span class="token function">curl</span><span class="token parameter variable">-sS</span><span class="token parameter variable">-u</span><span class="token string">"<span class="token variable">${<span class="token environment constant">USER</span>}</span>:<span class="token variable">${PASS}</span>"</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">..</span>.<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token variable">)</span></span><span class="token keyword">else</span><span class="token assign-left variable">response</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token variable"><span class="token variable">$(</span><span class="token function">curl</span><span class="token parameter variable">-sS</span><span class="token parameter variable">-H</span><span class="token string">"Authorization: Bearer <span class="token variable">${KEY}</span>"</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">..</span>.<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token variable">)</span></span><span class="token keyword">fi</span></code></pre><p>Multi-line string assignments cause YAML parsing errors, which means we need to use <code>echo -e</code> with <code>\n</code>:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token assign-left variable">MODIFIED_FILES</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token variable"><span class="token variable">$(</span><span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span><span class="token parameter variable">-e</span><span class="token string">"<span class="token variable">$MODIFIED_FILES</span><span class="token entity" title="\n">\n</span><span class="token variable">$NEW_FILES</span>"</span><span class="token variable">)</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="testing-deployment" tabindex="-1">Testing Deployment <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#testing-deployment" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>The script is written so that authentication is tested <em>before</em> uploading atttempts. GitLab CI provides detailed logs for deployment. You can visit your NeoCities site to confirm uploads, and make small changes to ensure only modified files are uploaded.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="https://brennan.day/#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>Despite how seemingly simple and obvious this pipeline probably seems, it took a lot of trial and error for me. For whatever reason, when I attempted <em>only</em> API key to deploy I kept getting failures, using username and password seems a lot more reliable.</p><p>Certain aspects of syntax will probably be different if you're not hosting your repository with GitLab. Sophie of <a href="https://localghost.dev/">localghost.dev</a> has a write-up specific for <a href="https://localghost.dev/blog/how-i-deploy-my-eleventy-site-to-neocities/">GitHub deployment</a> which I relied on for some debugging.</p><p>If you do use GitLab, it seems important to make sure your variables are, first and foremost, stored in GitLab settings instead of being present anywhere in your repository (this would give access of your password/API key to anybody). But also, ensure neither the &quot;protect variable&quot; nor the &quot;expand variable reference&quot; flags are checked.</p><p>That's about it, for now!</p><hr /><p>Do you host your site on NeoCities? I'd love to hear from other developers.
