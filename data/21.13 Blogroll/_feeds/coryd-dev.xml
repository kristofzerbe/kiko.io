                    <![CDATA[<p>This year has, to be frank, been exhausting. At least in a macro sense. It feels quite like the United States is collapsing as fascism and kleptocracy continue to take hold. Institutions are  being turned inward to attack the most vulnerable, corruption is rampant, the economy is sliding and we're only a year into this nightmare. I'd say look to the midterms, but who the hell knows if we'll even be able to vote by then.</p>

                    <![CDATA[<p>The last app I bought through Apple's app store was a client for my <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a> instance and this reminded me why <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/i-made-a-music-app">I'd built a Navidrome client</a>. I wanted to use the web application as a PWA, but Apple doesn't support continuous audio playback in PWAs or Safari on iOS. Audio plays, but it never advances to the next track.</p>
<p>I've moved my reading, audiobook and podcast activity to <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a>, but it's ebook support is rudimentary.<sup id="fnref:1"><span>1</span></sup> I briefly opened up Xcode and started prototyping an ebook reader that would leverage <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a>'s robust API and quickly realized that there was no reason to build a native app for this. It didn't require any native APIs, so why build something I intended largely for my own use only to deal with the headache of Apple's review process?</p>
<p>Instead, I closed Xcode, opened <a href="https://cursor.com">Cursor</a> and scaffolded out a PWA that uses <a href="https://github.com/gerhardsletten/react-reader">react-reader</a> (which leverages <a href="https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js">epub.js</a>) instead. I could iterate far quicker, have a performant and robust experience for my use case without anything between myself and any updates I want to issue. I have a reliable app that relies on authenticating against my <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a> instance, persists preferences and state using an SQLite database and none of the platform lock-in or review headaches.</p>
<p>PWAs, being built on web technology, offer more transparency as well. I can inspect the application, dig through network calls and see not only how it works but evaluate whether it's whether there are possible privacy concerns. This has lead me to establish new criteria for selecting applications I intend to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there’s a PWA, use it.</li>
<li>If a platform-specific API is required, use a native app that respects your privacy.</li>
<li>If neither are options, don’t use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm interacting with <a href="https://linkding.link">linkding</a>, my epub reader and <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> as web apps saved to my home screen on iOS and have <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> in my dock on macOS. Audio playback requires native APIs to work reliably, so <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/i-made-a-music-app">I built a Navidrome client</a> and selected an <a href="https://github.com/rasmuslos/ShelfPlayer">Audiobookshelf client</a> that respects my privacy.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, Apple would act in good faith and provide better support for PWAs. This world, however, is far from perfect and Apple has shown they'll only make choices like that, that benefit users, under duress.</p>
<p>The web platform provides an excellent experience, an open experience and one that should be preferred — when possible — over an onerous process that Apple controls.</p>
<p>I'll prefer openness and I will always value privacy.</p>

                    <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://linkding.link">linkding</a> is one of my favorite applications that I self-host and the place where I save everything I want to read later. The catch being that what little time I can dedicate to <em>actually</em> reading is spent on books. What I <em>do</em> have is time where I can listen to things while doing chores around the house, out on walks or otherwise engaged in an activity that doesn't demand my full, undivided attention.</p>
<p>I typically consume short form writing by listening to it. In the past, I've used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_(service)">Pocket</a><sup id="fnref:1"><span>1</span></sup>, <a href="https://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>, <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise's Reader</a> and Safari's listen to page feature for this. Safari had become something of a default choice for this as I didn't have a compelling, self-hosted option available. So I built one.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a> to listen to audiobooks and podcasts, making it a natural fit to listen to the articles I save. Neither Safari nor <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise's Reader</a> support queueing articles to listen to<sup id="fnref:2"><span>2</span></sup>, which meant starting playback manually for each article listened to. <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a> and the clients I've used all support queueing, which solves that particular usability pain point.</p>
<p>I have text, I have a solution for playing audio which left me needing to coerce the former into the latter. Rather than dump my entire bespoke project repo into a blog post, the high level flow looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deploy the project to my <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a> server using <a href="https://coolify.io">Coolify</a>.
<ul>
<li>The deploy clones the project, installs dependencies, downloads a <a href="https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl">Piper</a> voice model from <a href="https://huggingface.co">Hugging Face</a><sup id="fnref:3"><span>3</span></sup>, and configures a cron job to run every 5 minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Every 5 minutes the deployed application will check <a href="https://linkding.link">linkding</a> for new items.</li>
<li>If an item has not been converted to audio, is unread and is not tagged with <code>video</code> or <code>podcast</code>, the article text is fetched and parsed using Mozilla's <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability">Readability.js</a>.<sup id="fnref:4"><span>4</span></sup></li>
<li>Once parsed, the article is processed further into a string that will be converted to speech. This string is simply the following concatenated together: article title, author and content. Pauses are added after periods that don't otherwise have one, URLs are cleaned up and email addresses are removed.</li>
<li>The processed text is written to a temporary text file and passed to <a href="https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl">Piper</a> to generate a WAV file using the voice model downloaded when the application is deployed. <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org">ffmpeg</a> is used to convert the WAV file to an mp3 and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-id3">node-id3</a> is used to tag the resulting file.
<ul>
<li>The tag data is fairly simple — the article title is the episode title, a consistent, static podcast title (<code>Linkding Articles</code>) and artist (<code>Linkding TTS Bot</code>) and the article author and description are saved to the episode description. Year and date correspond to when the item was saved, the show art is the <a href="https://linkding.link">linkding</a> logo/icon and the rest is generic podcast metadata expected by <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the audio is generated and tagged, the app triggers a scan of my podcast library using the <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a> API.</li>
</ol>
<p>With all of this in place, I can save things to <a href="https://linkding.link">linkding</a> and there will be an automatically generated queue waiting when I open my preferred <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a> client.<sup id="fnref:5"><span>5</span></sup><sup id="fnref:6"><span>6</span></sup></p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li class="footnote" id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>RIP. <span>↩</span></p></li>
<li class="footnote" id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"><p>Or didn't when I last used them. <span>↩</span></p></li>
<li class="footnote" id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote"><p>Gross! I know. <span>↩</span></p></li>
<li class="footnote" id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote"><p>To avoid generating duplicate audio files, the ID for each processed article is stored in an array in a JSON file available to the application. The current episode number is also stored in this file. <span>↩</span></p></li>
<li class="footnote" id="fn:5" role="doc-endnote"><p>At the moment, this is <a href="https://github.com/rasmuslos/ShelfPlayer">ShelfPlayer</a>. <span>↩</span></p></li>
<li class="footnote" id="fn:6" role="doc-endnote"><p>If a site happens to disallow access when I try and fetch the article text, I'll stop trying to fetch it.

                    <![CDATA[<p>All of my projects are now stored on my <a href="https://forgejo.org">Forgejo</a> instance rather than GitHub as the latter continues to speed run the enshittification curve. I've implemented a manual deploy button in my site's admin but for other, lighter-weight projects, I prefer to deploy changes whenever I push them up.</p>
<p><a href="https://coolify.io">Coolify</a> has a native integration with GitHub, but not with other git hosts. For deploys, I've worked around this by cloning my projects using an API key within the Dockerfile for the project as a sort of lightweight continuous integration.</p>
<p>Within each <a href="https://coolify.io">Coolify</a> resource you'll find a webhooks section. There's a unique deploy webhook for each resource that accepts <code>POST</code> requests to trigger a new deployment. Rather than use a <a href="https://forgejo.org">Forgejo</a> action, I'm having the repositories that I want to deploy on push send a webhook event to the appropriate <a href="https://coolify.io">Coolify</a> deploy URL. You can do this in the <a href="https://forgejo.org">Forgejo</a> repository's webhooks settings by adding a webhook, selecting a target (I simply selected <a href="https://forgejo.org">Forgejo</a>, the first option in the list), adding the <a href="https://coolify.io">Coolify</a> URL, changing the <code>force</code> parameter value at the end of the URL from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code> to ensure the build is performed without using the cache and add a <code>Bearer &lt;COOLIFY-DEPLOY-TOKEN&gt;</code>. The Coolify API token only needs <code>deploy</code> permissions.</p>
<p>Now, when I push to Forgejo, it sends a <code>POST</code> request to the Coolify webhook and deploys a fresh build of the project.</p>

                    <![CDATA[<p>I've tracked my reading progress on my site for a bit now. I'd originally done this by fetching my progress from external APIs and sources on platforms like <a href="https://oku.club">Oku</a>, fetching and parsing the DOM on the <a href="https://thestorygraph.com">StoryGraph</a> and eventually importing and managing my own data. For years I've been reading and listening to audiobooks in Apple's Books app. Much like Apple's other media apps (music and TV, namely), Books has slowly moved in a direction that makes importing your own content increasingly difficult, while slowly pushing storefront elements into the home section of the app until they effectively took over.</p>
<p>What tethered me to Apple Books for so long was my investment in the reading streak I'd maintained. But that streak is simply a number, a number that I can and have replicated here. That streak, as of writing, stands at 2,095 days. I've finally uninstalled Books, let the streak lapse there and moved my reading activity to <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a> is heavily focused on audiobooks, but also supports reading ebooks in myriad formats. It also does a wonderful job of tying different formats together for the same book should you have it as, say, an audiobook, an epub, a mobi file — you name it. I have my audiobooks there and I've added my ebooks. There are quite a few audiobook clients for <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a>, which makes sense given the app's focus. I haven't found an app that supports its ebook functionality.<sup id="fnref:1"><span>1</span></sup> For a consistent experience, I've added my instance of the app to my iOS device homescreens via Safari.</p>
<p>I track my reading progress as a percentage of completion and increment my reading streak whenever progress is updated. My reading streak table consists of a <code>days_read</code> <code>integer</code> and a <code>last_read_date</code> <code>datetime</code>. This is handled by a trigger:</p>
<copyable-code snippet-slug="/snippets/update-days-readsql-trigger-2025-11-16-09-25-10">

    <p><a href="https://www.coryd.dev/snippets/update-days-readsql-trigger-2025-11-16-09-25-10">View snippet source</a></p>
  </noscript>
</copyable-code>
<p>And the function it runs:</p>

  </noscript>
</copyable-code>
<p>Up until now, I've manually updated reading progress via a widget on my <a href="https://filamentphp.com">Filament</a> dashboard. This was effective, but a bit tedious. However, since <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a> has <a href="https://api.audiobookshelf.org">a rich API</a>, I dove in to see what data I could retrieve programmatically. I arrived at a <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a> command that runs every 15 minutes. This command fetches items in progress, then fetches details for each item (with <code>expanded</code> set to <code>1</code> and <code>progress</code> included). The response will then include <code>userMediaProgress</code> which, in turn, contains <code>ebookProgress</code> and <code>progress</code>. Audiobookshelf tracks distinct progress states for ebooks and audiobooks that are bundled together. The full command looks like this:</p>
<copyable-code snippet-slug="/snippets/syncbookprogresscommandphp-2025-11-16-09-45-54">

    <p><a href="https://www.coryd.dev/snippets/syncbookprogresscommandphp-2025-11-16-09-45-54">View snippet source</a></p>
  </noscript>
</copyable-code>
<p>Once the progress is retrieved, it updates the progress for the book in my site's database via <a href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a> by looking it up via the ISBN and, failing that, the title. As I read, <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a> records my progress, my site polls my instance of the app and updates each book's progress and my ongoing reading streak.</p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to automating my progress tracking, I've updated my book data importer to fetch data from <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a>. It is also able to fetch data from <a href="https://books.google.com">Google Books</a> and <a href="https://openlibrary.org">Open Library</a> but, since I've consolidated my reading to <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a>, it made sense to import data from it directly to better align the record in my database with the source record. This import is second hand, in a sense as <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">Audiobookshelf</a> imports from other sources (Apple Books, funnily enough, is my default), but provides the best results:</p>
<copyable-code snippet-slug="/snippets/importbookcommandphp-2025-11-16-10-08-36">

    <p><a href="https://www.coryd.dev/snippets/importbookcommandphp-2025-11-16-10-08-36">View snippet source</a></p>
  </noscript>
</copyable-code>
<p>This process is kicked off by clicking an Import Book command on my dashboard, which opens a modal with a dropdown to select the API source and an import for the required ID for that source.</p>
<p>With all that configured, I can quickly import data on the book I'm reading and progress will be automatically recorded as I read (or listen) to it.</p>

                    <![CDATA[<p>I've moved all of my personal, private projects over to <a href="https://git.coryd.dev">my own forgejo instance</a>. It's been reliable and an altogether simple transition — I even have it mirroring the <a href="https://git.coryd.dev/cdransf/ai.robots.txt">ai.robots.txt</a> repo.</p>
<p>While most of my projects on the instance are private (like the source for this site and for <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/i-made-a-music-app">Cadence</a>), I wanted the <code>robots.txt</code> file for forgejo to align with <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/robots.txt">this site's</a>. Thankfully, updating the forgejo <code>robots.txt</code> is straightforward. I'm deploying my instance in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)">Docker</a> container using <a href="https://coolify.io">Coolify</a> and update the file as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>ssh into the server where the container is running.</li>
<li>Run <code>docker ps -a | grep forgejo</code> to get the forgejo container name.</li>
<li>Log into the container using <code>docker exec -it &lt;NAME&gt; sh</code>.</li>
<li>Navigate to forgejo's public directory: <code>cd data/gitea/public</code>.</li>
<li>Open <code>robots.txt</code>: <code>vi robots.txt</code>.</li>
<li>Add entries as you see fit.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've mirrored my site's <code>robots.txt</code> to my forgejo instance and I've also included the rules <a href="https://codeberg.org/robots.txt">from Codeberg</a>'s (up until the <code># Codeberg-specific changes</code> to the end of the file). <a href="https://git.coryd.dev/robots.txt">You can view the full file here</a>.</p>
<p><code>robots.txt</code> is, of course, a voluntary mechanism, but including these directives is still prudent.</p>

                    <![CDATA[<p>One of my ongoing efforts in building this site has been to embrace progressive enhancement and make it every bit as functional without JavaScript as it is with JavaScript. This has become much easier now that <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/this-site-runs-on-laravel">I've rebuilt the site using Laravel</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you're disabling JavaScript for security or performance reasons or are visiting using a tool that does not support it, every feature of the site should work without it. What this looks like in practice, is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A submit button will be rendered with search and results will be paginated.</li>
<li>Pagination will still use a select element to allow you to choose a page, but a button will be rendered alongside it to submit the pagination form and route you to the appropriate page.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.coryd.dev/snippets">Code snippets</a> embedded using a web component I've written will, instead, link to the dedicated page for the snippet.</li>
<li>Videos I host on <a href="https://bunny.net/?ref=revw3mehej">bunny.net</a> will fall back to using the native video element.</li>
<li>Videos I've embedded from Youtube's <code>https://www.youtube-nocookie.com</code> domain will instead link out to the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's largely all there is to this. Much of what's dynamically updated is handled on the server and sent over the wire. JavaScript is not required and, ideally, it should not be.</p>

<p>They're not challenging Chrome by building something new, they're building on the foundation provided by Chromium and layering on their own, proprietary product integrations.

This helps ChatGPT recognize what each element does and interact with your site more accurately.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA">But that's not what ARIA is meant for:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles">roles</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes">attributes</a> that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><mark>ARIA's intended use is to make the web more accessible for people.</mark></p>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a saying "No ARIA is better than bad ARIA." In <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/#aria">WebAim's survey of over one million home pages</a>, they found that Home pages with ARIA present averaged 41% more detected errors than those without ARIA. While ARIA is designed to make web pages more accessible, if used incorrectly, it can do more harm than good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenAI is explicitly telling developers to add <strong>more</strong> ARIA <em>for the browser</em>, which directly contradicts the "No ARIA is better than bad ARIA" principle. This creates a perverse incentive to become less accessible to actual people with disabilities in order to be more "readable" by Atlas.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai400bn/">These companies are burning through cash</a> and need to monetize these products. <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/">Atlas' agent mode is restricted to paid tiers</a> and, what I expect to see is that these browsers will continue to layer on propriety features which users will become accustomed to. These features will misuse web specifications or require that developers customize their applications to meet the needs of these browsers.</p>
<p>Users will be hooked by the conveniences of the browser(s), developers and companies will have invested time and resources into establishing compatibility after, presumably, being promised increased usage and access to the browser's users. Once users and business customers are invested and the browser is entrenched as a middleman, they'll be in a position to extract more and more value from both parties.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> pay up for features that used to be free, or pay more for the features you were already paying for. All that browsing data? That'll be mined and used to serve targeted ads under the guise of personalization and an improved browsing experience.</p>
<p><strong>Business customers:</strong> keep implementing changes required for compatibility. Never mind that we're not sending search traffic to you — you can pay for ads, pay for placement, or whatever else we come up with.</p>
<p>Once both sides are hooked, they'll squeeze as much value out of their position as they can because <em>they absolutely need the money</em>.</p>
<p>The open web? That will suffer as business customers chase access to the end users of the browser and implement ever more proprietary changes demanded by these AI companies.</p>
<p>There's a market here, or at least one being created and sold as inevitable. Browser after browser is being launched as a chokepoint between users and the open web. Incumbent browser makers are already integrating AI functionality into their browsers (see Gemini in Chrome and whatever Mozilla is doing with Firefox).</p>
<p>Websites that work perfectly in traditional browsers may end up broken for actual accessibility tools. The web will fragment as sites must test against a growing number of AI browser agents with different requirements. Privacy will erode as browsing becomes increasingly mediated by AI from companies with no qualms about monetizing user data.</p>
<p>Users will suffer, business users and everyone being visited by users of these browsers will suffer, the open web will suffer and AI companies will, maybe, make some money while leaving wreckage in their wake. This is being sold as a new platform while following the same enshittification playbook.</p>

                                <description>
                    <![CDATA[<p>The city of Camarillo (where I live) is <a href="https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/2025/10/16/camarillo-police-get-15-new-license-plate-readers/86708143007/">planning to install 15 new Flock ALPR cameras</a>, bringing the city's total installed base up to 20. The city is adding to a surveillance network that has already been abused and misused by agencies across the country.</p>
<p>Nobody should be proactively surveilled. Promises of transparency mean nothing when there's already ample evidence that this technology has been abused. There is no reason to believe that this technology will not also be abused when it's not installed here, particularly when the city outsources policing duty to county sheriffs <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/letter-to-camarillo-city-council-regarding-local-ice-activity">whose chief has made it very clear that he will cooperate with abusive, fascist agencies like ICE to the maximum extent possible</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/L9FptO4IyXM?t=6649">While Ventura County Sheriff's Cmdr. Eric Tennessen appears to mean well</a>, there are numerous instances of Flock cameras being misused, data being shared despite existing agreements and laws, and other violations.</p>
<p>The sheriff won't have to explicitly cooperate with ICE by providing access to the system or the installed cameras. ICE, the secret service and the navy <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-secret-service-navy-all-had-access-to-flocks-nationwide-network-of-cameras/">have already been provided access to Flock's surveillance network</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the section of ICE that had access and which has reassigned more than ten thousand employees to work on the agency’s mass deportation campaign, performed nearly two hundred searches in the system, the letter [sent by Senator Ron Wyden] says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wyden continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I now believe that abuses of your product are not only likely but inevitable, and that Flock is unable and uninterested in preventing them,"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://lataco.com/oxnard-dash-cam-ice-crash">ICE has already been harassing, abusing and assaulting volunteers in Ventura County</a> and both the sheriffs and police departments have done little to maintain community trust beyond providing meaningless boilerplate statements that amount to "trust us, we're the police".</p>
<hr>
<p>The list of departments abusing access to Flock's nationwide network of cameras is a long one. <a href="https://www.404media.co/police-said-they-surveilled-woman-who-had-an-abortion-for-her-safety-court-records-show-they-considered-charging-her-with-a-crime/">In Texas, police claimed they used the network to surveil a woman who had an abortion for her safety. Court records revealed that they considered charging her with a crime.</a></p>
<p>Flock told 404 Media to reach out to Johnson County Sheriff Adam King to learn more about the search but — guess what — <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/johnson-county-sheriff-adam-king-indicted-felony-sexual-harassment-case/?ref=404media.co">King was arrested by his own deputies for harassing female members of his staff and threatening them with arrest should they report his conduct</a>. To top things off, he was charged with aggravated perjury for allegedly lying to a grand jury about the incident(s). Flock sells their equipment to law enforcement and simply assumes it will not be abused. This is not a safe assumption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Given Flock's total failure to prevent abuses, law enforcement that have paid for this surveillance technology should immediately lock down their settings for which other agencies can access their data, and should seriously reconsider whether this technology should be installed in their communities in the first place,” <a href="https://www.404media.co/police-said-they-surveilled-woman-who-had-an-abortion-for-her-safety-court-records-show-they-considered-charging-her-with-a-crime/">Senator Ron Wyden told 404 Media.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.404media.co/feds-used-local-cops-password-to-do-immigration-surveillance-with-flock-cameras/">Federal agents have also used passwords issued to local officials to engage in surveillance</a>. Again, in Oregon, at least one police department <a href="https://info4publicuse.org/2025/06/mass-surveillance-and-ice-backdoors-in-southern-oregon/?ref=404media.co">has collaborated with ICE and other agencies to engage in mass surveillance</a>. Flock has also <a href="https://www.404media.co/flock-decides-not-to-use-hacked-data-in-people-search-tool/">considered using hacked data in a new people search product they've named Nova</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/evanston-oak-park-end-contracts-flock-safety-license-plate-reader-company-investigation-illinois/17678137/">The company has seen contracts cancelled in communities in Illinois when it was revealed that ALPR readers were illegally sharing information with the feds:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Company leadership was unaware of a pilot program with the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Protection Agency. This put them in direct violation of Illinois law," Giannoulias said.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Flock provides a surveillance tool that has and will continue to be used by law enforcement agencies to violate the rights of citizens in the communities said agencies are supposed to serve. Each installation will be accompanied with promises that the agency operating the cameras should be trusted. Those promises have not and will not be kept. Once a tool like this is installed, once surveillance powers are granted they are rarely, if ever, walked back. <mark>Guaranteeing that you can be more secure by surrendering any amount of privacy is a lie.</mark></p>
<p>I encourage you to report the ALPRs in your community using <a href="https://deflock.me">DeFlock</a> and to search for cameras that have already been installed. <a href="https://www.404media.co/flock-threatens-open-source-developer-mapping-its-surveillance-cameras/">That DeFlock has been threatened by Flock</a> makes it clear that the tool is having an impact. Flock provides tools for surveilling everyone that comes close to them, it's only fair for said tools to be surveilled and identified in turn.</p>
<p>In Camarillo's case, this installation was approved unanimously by the city council and, for that, every member of the council should be ashamed.</p>

                                <description>
                    <![CDATA[<p>I've nearly entirely rewritten my site over the past few months. First, <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/this-site-runs-on-laravel">I refactored the frontend into a Laravel application</a> that leveraged the same <a href="https://docs.postgrest.org/en/v13/">postgREST</a> endpoints that my long-running <a href="https://11ty.dev">11ty</a> site used. Next, I wrote a new administrative application in <a href="https://filamentphp.com">Filament</a> and migrated off of <a href="https://directus.io">Directus</a>. If I did this right, the changes went largely unnoticed. It made management of the site more seamless and it made writing dynamic frontend templates simpler by using a single, unified syntax.</p>
<p>I've been scrobbling my listening history to my own site for over a year now and it's gone well. It's also undergone significant change. I started it as an experiment and as part of an effort to own more of my own data. I've long been a fan of <a href="https://www.last.fm">last.fm</a> but it often felt minimally maintained and has now been acquired by new owners (as part of the Paramount sale) that, to be frank, I have <mark>absolutely no faith in</mark> to steward the platform, discard it or mine it for AI training data.</p>
<p>My scrobbling application started out by reading from and writing to massive JSON blobs in <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>'s blob storage. This was an approach and tool not suited to the task. I soon migrated the data to <a href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</a>. Postgres, naturally, worked better for structured data. At this point, I was using <a href="https://www.plex.tv">Plex</a> and <a href="https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/">Plexamp</a> to listen to my music which, conveniently, emitted a scrobble event. I pointed this scrobble event at a <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> edge function and wrote the listen to Postgres.</p>
<p>With data in Postgres, I would query <a href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</a>'s API during <a href="https://11ty.dev">11ty</a> builds. This was a slow process as the amount of data and complexity of relationships caused queries to slow. Learning as I went, I wrote optimized views to significantly reduce the time these API calls took, improving build times in turn. I migrated from <a href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</a> to a Postgres database I host and build times remained consistent.</p>
<p>At this point, the scrobbler looked like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dedicated music page with my top artists, albums and track plays for the current week.</li>
<li>An identical page, but rendered with the data for the last month.</li>
<li>A page for each artist I scrobbled listens to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relatively simple, right? I had skipped pages for each album, knowing that it would dramatically increase the number of pages being built. <em>But</em>, build times still grew as artists were added. Each artist was a new page to write, each artist image was a new image for <a href="https://11ty.dev">11ty</a> to optimize and a new discography of album images to optimize. Perfectly workable, but not sustainable over the long term.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/migrating-from-plex-to-jellyfin-for-music">I eventually moved my music listening to Jellyfin</a>. This worked fairly well, but made scrobbling more difficult. Rather than a single scrobble event, <a href="https://jellyfin.org">Jellyfin</a> would send playback ticks to a webhook (again, an edge function). I revised the receiving edge function to accept the playback ticks, perform some simple math and scrobble the track. <em>But</em>, without fail, it would stop sending events for longer songs.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/tracking-listens-from-navidrome">Navidrome</a>. This is where I'm at currently and happily. It's reliable, performant and easy to manage. I've enjoyed it enough to <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/i-made-a-music-app">write and maintain my own client</a>. The catch with <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/tracking-listens-from-navidrome">Navidrome</a> was that it supports scrobbling to <a href="https://listenbrainz.org">ListenBrainz</a> and <a href="https://www.last.fm">last.fm</a>, but doesn't emit events to webhooks or custom endpoints. It does, however, have a dynamic frontend that makes API calls to the application backend. <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/tracking-listens-from-navidrome">I poked around a bit and found a private API that returns exactly the data I need</a>. It doesn't send events, I simply fetch the data from my instance regularly.<sup id="fnref:1"><span>1</span></sup></p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a>. Rewriting the frontend of my site became necessary as the amount of data and rendered pages grew. It required a significant effort to write, migrate the hosting and develop a caching strategy. <em>But</em>, it solved the ever-growing build times. I'd started with a personal site and blog, hit constraints and grew it into an application.<sup id="fnref:2"><span>2</span></sup></p>
<p>Now, with the build time constraint no longer a concern, I've added pages for each album. I already had album records which allowed me to create pages by writing a migration to add a slug field and programmatically populate it as <code>/album-name</code>. This is then appended to the artist slug and used to present the appropriate album as determined by the requested route.</p>
<p>Albums need a track list though. Up to this point I hadn't created a dedicated tracks table or incorporated track data into my scrobbler schema. Listens were connected to albums, albums to artists. Having album pages and wanting track lists meant that I could add static track lists and not attribute listens to tracks or I could try and either create them from my listen records (e.g. normalize song titles and match artist, album and listens to get unique tracks), but this wouldn't get me track numbers in the records, which doesn't make for much of a track list. Instead, I wrote a node script that went through every single release I have on <a href="https://www.navidrome.org">Navidrome</a>, wrote the necessary data to a new tracks table and connected them to the appropriate album.</p>
<p>Once I had tracks populated and linked, <em>I wrote yet another script</em> and associated listens to the appropriate track record. Out of roughly 40,000 records, I ended up with about 600 misses to correct. Some of these were malformed and discarded, while others were valid and were not linked due to differences in capitalization or another edge case. With listens linked to tracks, I was able to populate a play count field for each track based on the count of linked records. When a track is scrobbled, there's a Postgres function that updates the total plays attributed to a listen, album, artist and genre.</p>
<p>I've also written a bespoke <a href="https://www.navidrome.org">Navidrome</a> importer. When I log into <a href="https://filamentphp.com">Filament</a>, I have a widget with buttons that let me post a status, manually fetch scrobbles, manually update play totals, re-deploy the site and import books, movies, shows, artists and upcoming episodes for shows I'm actively watching. Clicking to import an artist opens a modal with a single input for their <a href="https://www.navidrome.org">Navidrome</a> ID. I paste in that ID and, for new artists, it creates an artist record, all of their associated albums and all of their associated tracks. This data is guaranteed to match new scrobbles because it's sourced from where I'm scrobbling from. If it's an existing artist, it will only import new albums. If it's an upcoming album I don't have tracks for yet, it will import and attach those. After an import, I briefly verify the import data to make sure that artist and album art is correct.</p>
<p>If my importer happens to create a duplicate artist or album record (this happens occasionally with legacy records when my slugify method used to create artist and album keys creates a new key that doesn't match), I have album and artist correction fields in their respective edit views in Filament. I supply the key for the old record to the correction field in the new record and, when saved, a service will move all data and related records to the new album or artist.</p>
<p>If I've added an upcoming album that doesn't have a track list I can import, I'll take a look at <a href="https://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> to see if the track list and durations are available there. If they are, I've written a <a href="https://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> service that will import tracks from their API when provided with the appropriate relationships.</p>
<p>If a scrobble happens to not find a listen record, my scrobbler emails me via <a href="https://forwardemail.net">forwardemail.net</a>'s API with the data I need to identify and correct the record. This will happen if there's any missing data in the listen -&gt; track -&gt; album -&gt; artist chain.</p>
<p>With tracks for each artist and each album, this site has roughly 5,000 pages dedicated to this scrobbler implementation.</p>
<p>Recently I, somewhat jokingly, <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/status/1-buy-music-2-tag-2025-10-16-14-54-35">posted a granular breakdown of my workflow for adding new music</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy music</li>
<li>Tag music</li>
<li>Add artist image to root (if new artist)</li>
<li>Export album covers to mp3 and flac folders</li>
<li>Copy album covers to screen saver directory</li>
<li>Use rclone to sync music to S3 storage</li>
<li>ssh into <a href="https://www.navidrome.org">Navidrome</a> server</li>
<li>Restart <a href="https://www.navidrome.org">Navidrome</a> + rclone mount to invalidate cache and initiate a scan</li>
<li>Import artist/album data into site from <a href="https://www.navidrome.org">Navidrome</a> after the scan</li>
<li>Verify art for artist + albums</li>
<li>Format/update/write artist bio</li>
<li>Play</li>
</ol>
<p>This is accurate and also much quicker than you might expect. It's also much faster than the manual data entry that my earlier implementations of this entailed.</p>
<p>My initial scrobbler implementation was both naive and poorly designed. I've learned a lot as I've evolved this across new storage mechanisms, platforms, players and languages. What I have now is mature and robust. Imports are reliable. Scrobbling itself is reliable. Errors are reported automatically and easy to correct.</p>
<p>This also means that I own all of my music, play it from a server I control, using storage I control, via a client I've written and all of the data is stored on my own infrastructure. I author my own charts and can do as much or as little as I want with the data. I enjoy being able to view my own listening habits and run whatever granular queries I want. I've integrated concert tracking with artist pages, I've added support for tracking upcoming albums and exposed a calendar subscription.</p>
<p><mark>It's my data, in my control, on my infrastructure and the freedom to do what I want with it.</mark></p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li class="footnote" id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>This has the added benefit of persisting the data to be re-fetched should my consuming application experience an outage. <span>↩</span></p></li>
<li class="footnote" id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"><p>I also track books I'm reading, movies and shows I'm watching and concerts attended here, but those are separate posts. <span>↩</span></p></li></ol></div>

                    <![CDATA[<p>If you've ever wondered what domains the US federal government has registered, there's a rather exhaustive list over in the <a href="https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data">dotgov-data</a> repository on GitHub, which is maintained by <a href="https://www.cisa.gov">CISA</a>. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/dotgov-data/main/current-federal.csv">You can see the raw CSV here</a>. They don't include the registration date, but you can derive that from public WHOIS records or by examining the repository's git history.</p>
<p>With that data in hand, it's easy enough to assemble a list of <code>.gov</code> domains registered since the inauguration of our aspiring dictator. Visiting each domain reveals a number of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all of these are active.</li>
<li>Given how brief some of the acronyms used as domain names are, it's not easy to definitively say what they pertain to.</li>
<li>Several are redirects (e.g. waste.gov redirects to dei.gov which is inactive — because this administration is staffed by the stupid and the cruel).</li>
<li>Sites built by this administration are embarrassingly bloated, gaudy and <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/a-notional-design-studio/">poorly designed</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>doge.gov</code> dumps a payload of over 200 MB on unsuspecting visitors. This is because it's built with Next.js<sup id="fnref:1"><span>1</span></sup> and is little more than a stack of X/Twitter<sup id="fnref:2"><span>2</span></sup> embeds. Government efficiency, right?</p>
<p><code>trumpcard.gov</code>? That's a 7.18 MB payload. <code>americabydesign.gov</code> weighs in at 3.75 MB, <code>ndstudio.gov</code> dumps 12.3 MB into your browser and <code>trumprx.gov</code> is a comparatively lightweight 2.15 MB. All of these are with Next.js and have A records with IPs pointing to Cloudflare.</p>
<p>The lightest of these new digital disasters is <code>usai.gov</code> at 1.66 MB, but that was built with Astro and is sitting on AWS. It also looks like it was designed without the help of <mark>THE NATIONAL DESIGN STUDIO IN PART BECAUSE THE TEXT ISN'T ALL SET AT 60 PX</mark>.</p>
<p><code>whitehouse.gov</code> predates this administration, but the current WordPress install weighs in at a hefty 12.4 MB.</p>
<p>Of the 24 domains registered since inauguration day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 6 are active websites (25%)</li>
<li>4 are redirects to other sites</li>
<li>14 are completely inactive or placeholders</li>
<li>The 6 active sites average 39 MB each in transferred data<sup id="fnref:3"><span>3</span></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Why is nearly every site this administration builds using Next.js + Cloudflare? A whole lot of this could be static output — the source for <code>go.gov</code> is nice and boring and weighs in at 103.1 KB.</p>
<p>Everything this administration does is cruel, thoughtless and sloppy. What they've built for the web is a reflection of that.</p>

                    <![CDATA[<p>I've been using an <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2023/i-block-ads">adblocker of some sort or another</a> for roughly as long as I've been using the internet. It's become a necessary security measure and a necessary part of protecting your attention online. I also pay for and frequently use a VPN. Privacy should factor in to every decision you make online.</p>
<p>While I'm protecting my privacy and security online, companies and platforms attempt to protect their platforms and infrastructure using a variety tools. One of the most visible, user-facing tools in their arsenal are CAPTCHAs.</p>
<p>Decipher squiggly letters, click a checkbox for Cloudflare, help train Google's AI by identifying objects, click a checkbox for Cloudflare, click a checkbox for Cloudflare, click a checkbox for Cloudflare, click a checkbox for Cloudflare, drop a puzzle piece in the right place, click a checkbox for Cloudflare. Round and round we go.</p>
<p>I'm not a bot, but the web is increasingly dominated by them. The more you take steps to preserve your privacy and security the more you find yourself at odds with the tools platforms use to secure themselves. It's both tedious and frustrating.</p>
<p>I can't sit here and decry platforms for seeking to protect themselves from malicious actors. What I would like are security measures that don't necessitate disabling adblockers and other tools in order to either properly interact with them or avoid doing so altogether.</p>
<p>I find myself spinning through Cloudflare's Turnstile constantly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/cloudflare-blocking-me-randomly/620706/3">Normally, instances like this are attributable to an ad blocker plugin.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><mark>This is not a reasonable solution.</mark> If my adblocker breaks your tool or breaks your site, I'm inclined to argue that the fault lies with your implementation. A robust solution is a defensively built solution. A security tool that relies on JavaScript and fails entirely absent its availability is not robust. The failure state should not be to lock users out. I'm willing to assume good intent and attribute this to engineering oversights, but it remains a terrible experience.</p>
<p>I don't want ads (I make purchases intentionally), I do want to remain secure and I'd love to see fewer CAPTCHAs. That these tools either can't or won't distinguish users that want to experience a secure and distraction-free web from malicious activity <em>does</em> feel like punishment.</p>

                    <![CDATA[<p>RSS has been my preferred way to read content on the web for over a decade now (RIP Google Reader). It's a clean, efficient and simple way to curate your own news and content from across the web.</p>
<p>I'll leave it to Molly White to <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/">much more eloquently expound upon the benefits of RSS generally</a>, but I wanted to add post a list of RSS readers that I recommend.</p>

<p><em>Where paid means there's a paid, hosted version available and self-hosted indicates that the reader can be self-hosted.</em></p>
<p>If you're publishing content, help readers discover your feed(s) by adding a tag like the following to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> content of your site:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml" data-lang="html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">link</span> <span class="hljs-attr">rel</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"alternate"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">href</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"https://www.coryd.dev/feeds/posts.xml"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">title</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"Posts • Cory Dransfeldt"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"application/rss+xml"</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If a feed you're subscribed to includes ads or posts you don't want to see, many of these applications offer filters that will hide items from your feed. Implementations vary, so you'll want to reference their documentation.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm hosting an instance of <a href="https://freshrss.org">FreshRSS</a>, using <a href="https://netnewswire.com">NetNewsWire</a> as a client and saving items to my <a href="https://linkding.link">linkding</a> instance.</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
