      <title>My Changing Media Landscape</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/my-changing-media-landscape/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I cancelled Disney Plus in September (though my annual sub runs until March). A year ago, I downloaded my entire Kindle library and stopped buying from their store. Netflix was cancelled in December. Audible went bye-bye sometime last summer. None of this was planned, exactly - more like a series of small decisions that eventually accumulated into something larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons are varied but overlapping. Streaming services have kept raising prices while the parts of their libraries I cared about shrank or became stagnant. Movies I wanted to watch would vanish without warning, or arrive in the UK months later. At various times my partner and I complained about catching ourselves scrolling endlessly through recommendations we didn’t want, looking for the handful of things we actually cared about. Often we’d spend more time trying to find something to watch than actually watching something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3OgkiXH&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;UGREEN NASync DXP4200 Plus&lt;/a&gt; (affiliate link) in May 2025, partly as a general storage solution for the house, but I also started forming the makings of a plan to bring together all these changes into a better “media landscape” for our household. It’s taken effort, but it’s at a point where we’re starting to see the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-our-own-netflix&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/my-changing-media-landscape/#building-our-own-netflix&quot;&gt;Building Our Own Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first steps were simple enough, though it involved more outlay: I bought a Pioneer BDR-XD07TS external Blu-ray drive from eBay. It supports UHD discs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=18856&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;LibreDrive firmware&lt;/a&gt;, which matters if you want the least frustrating time backing up what you own. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makemkv.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MakeMKV&lt;/a&gt; for ripping and &lt;a href=&quot;https://handbrake.fr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Handbrake&lt;/a&gt; for converting to something more space-efficient when needed, I had a workflow I could use basically anywhere. At times I setup an old laptop in the corner of my office and would swap out discs as necessary while I was working on other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with the DVD and Blu-rays we still owned, then gradually added more as we found things we wanted - a few were bought new from HMV, but the majority came from eBay or CEX as second-hand purchases. When one of the kids showed interest in 80’s/early 90’s movies, it was easy and relatively cheap to get several to add to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection’s grown quite a bit over the last few months, all sitting on the NAS, which is running &lt;a href=&quot;https://jellyfin.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jellyfin&lt;/a&gt; as a container. On Apple devices we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://firecore.com/infuse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Infuse&lt;/a&gt; for playback - I tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jellyfin/Swiftfin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Swiftfin&lt;/a&gt; first but it was too buggy. The Jellyfin web UI works fine for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My partner loves it. She described it as “her own personal Netflix” - just the stuff she actually wants to watch, without algorithms trying to convince her she needs to see whatever’s being promoted this week. That’s become the recurring theme: intentionality over abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main technical consideration was network access. I use a reverse proxy to handle TLS, and everything runs through a Tailscale Tailnet to keep it private and secure. I can - and have - streamed music and video from the NAS to my phone while on the bus, walking around town, or sitting in a cafe. The details probably warrant their own post, but the short version is: it works, and it works reliably&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/my-changing-media-landscape/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovery is the obvious trade-off. New films mean cinema trips (which is no bad thing, just rare for us) or waiting for physical releases. For TV shows, physical releases are becoming genuinely difficult to find. There’s no general UK release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/83867-andor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Andor&lt;/a&gt; on Blu-ray, for example - just an expensive limited edition season 1 UHD box set that is hard to justify. I have a low-res copy of season 1 from a DVD purchased off eBay - one I now suspect was less than legit! Other Disney-owned shows are similar: my partner can’t get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/62046-scream-queens&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Scream Queens&lt;/a&gt; season 2 in the UK, for example. Only the first Knives Out film has a physical release for another example. If we can’t get something physically, or through iPlayer or other UK services, we often just… don’t watch it. Them’s the breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other challenge has been time, particularly for TV shows. Ripping discs isn’t difficult, but episodes aren’t always in order on the disc itself. I’ve found I need to manually verify once they’re extracted. I didn’t realise this at first and had to go back and fix about 160 episodes across several shows and seasons. Now I check as I go. It’s tedious but manageable. The upshot is that new stuff tends to get added “as and when” I have time. I still have a couple of box sets I need to work through to get caught up with everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I’ve backed up our discs I pop them into a large slip-case; it holds 400 discs, and I think I’ll need to get another before long. The original cases get chucked into the recycling. This is the best practical solution we have to storage space limitations while keeping the original copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;piecing-together-a-music-history&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/my-changing-media-landscape/#piecing-together-a-music-history&quot;&gt;Piecing Together a Music History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My music library was archaeology. I went all-in on music streaming &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; ago, as it seemed so much more convenient at the time. I had an old iTunes library scattered across multiple backups and old hard disks, fragments of history going back decades. I consolidated it all, cleaned up the metadata, reorganised the folder structure, then loaded everything into Jellyfin. It took a couple of weeks. In doing so I found I had many albums I knew I owned, but must’ve never ripped from my original CDs. While my CD library has had some attrition over the years, I still had a large chunk of it in a box in the loft. It’s on my todo list to bring the box down and fill in those gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New purchases are coming from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qobuz.com/gb-en/shop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Qobuz&lt;/a&gt; if it’s a brand-new release, otherwise eBay and Music Magpie are OK for second-hand CDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On iOS I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finer-player/id6738301953&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Finer&lt;/a&gt; for playback; on Arch I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://tauonmusicbox.rocks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tauon Music Box&lt;/a&gt;. Everything &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/user/chrismcleod&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;scrobbles to Last.fm&lt;/a&gt; through Jellyfin/the client, which once &lt;a href=&quot;http://last.fm/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt; catches up to what I listen to in 2026 might help with discovery&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/my-changing-media-landscape/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The central column lists tracks grouped by album. Right panel shows a monochrome portrait of a woman boxed in orange along with track and album info: Mirtazapine; Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party (2025); In the left sidebar is a list of playlists: Jellyfin Collection; Rediscovered; Xmas Eve 2025; Artist: Hayley Williams. Playback controls are at bottom.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have kept Apple Music. It’s included in a bundle we all use for other things, and I still like it for mood playlists when I don’t have something specific in mind - just a vibe I want that isn’t in my collection. Soundtracks and Classical, mostly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/marvis-pro/id1447768809&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Marvis Pro&lt;/a&gt; handles that nicely on iOS, as does &lt;a href=&quot;https://cider.sh/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cider&lt;/a&gt; on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination works: my library for intentional listening, Apple Music for when I just need something different in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-great-drm-escape&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/my-changing-media-landscape/#the-great-drm-escape&quot;&gt;The Great DRM Escape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books were more fraught. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Amazon removed the ability to download your Kindle library&lt;/a&gt;, but I managed to get mine before the window closed. Removing the DRM was straightforward enough with the right tools. Apple Books was a different story - I could get the files, but couldn’t remove the DRM, and so they’re stuck in Apple’s ecosystem forever. This was only a small handful of titles though, and I can read them on my iPad, so while it’s inconvenient, it’s not a huge loss overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched to &lt;a href=&quot;https://calibre-ebook.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Calibre&lt;/a&gt; for library management and bought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-colour&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kobo Clara Colour&lt;/a&gt; for reading. The physical buttons were the deciding factor. I could never quite place why I fell out of love with eBooks and readers; it turns out I don’t want to tap a screen to turn pages - I want to press a button. It’s a small thing that matters enormously in practice. This is the first eReader I’ve owned since the 2nd-generation Kindle I’ve actually &lt;em&gt;enjoyed&lt;/em&gt; using for any length of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most ebooks I’ve bought since the switch now come DRM-free directly from publishers when the option exists. Occasionally I’ll buy physical if I know I’ll want to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cancelled Audible at some point as I wasn’t using it anymore - there are a few audiobooks in my library but they’re basically incidental to everything else. &lt;a href=&quot;https://getlibation.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Libation&lt;/a&gt; helped with these. I run &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audiobookshelf.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;AudioBookShelf&lt;/a&gt; on the NAS to manage and listen to my audiobooks. The web player suffices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of hands-on management vs size of collection, books have probably taken up an outsized slice of my time. Book metadata is rarely consistent it seems, with titles and series data being all over the place once loaded into Calibre. Correcting and organising it in a logical manner is an ongoing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/my-changing-media-landscape/#wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a library that’s ours now, in a way that streaming catalogues never were. There’s privacy in not having viewing habits tracked and analysed. There’s ownership that feels genuinely different from renting access. Our library has grown to 101 movies, 20 TV shows, and nearly 6,000 tracks across almost a thousand albums - about 3 terabytes total&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/my-changing-media-landscape/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It’s a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, though, I’m not scrolling through endless recommendations trying to find something worth watching or listening to. I’m choosing from things I’ve already decided matter. That sounds trivial, but it’s changed how I engage with media. I find I’m watching and listening &lt;em&gt;more often&lt;/em&gt; despite having “less choice”, because I’m not wasting time hunting past what’s been chosen for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My partner feels the same way. The lack of algorithmic noise is its own kind of luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed more people talking about similar approaches - fatigue with streaming, frustration with DRM, a desire to actually own things again. “Going analogue” with physical media is something I’ve seen a lot recently. So I wanted to write about what I’d done and what works for us. Recent posts from others helped inspire me to put words to blog after months of thinking about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://herve.alsace/taking-back-control-of-the-music-i-listen-to/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Taking back control of the music I listen to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hidde.blog/owning-music/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;I’m back to building my own digital music collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ivikrant.net/2026/01/20/apple-tv-movie-collection-2026/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Apple TV Movie Collection 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does require an investment - both time and money. Ripping and organising takes (a lot) longer than clicking “subscribe”. There are technical considerations around storage and network access. Discovery is genuinely harder without recommendation engines, even if those engines were mostly noise anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this far in, we don’t miss the services. Our library grows slowly and deliberately. We enjoy what we choose to keep. The trade-offs feel worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My desktop does keep losing access since I rebuilt it.

      <title>Default Apps for 2025</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/default-apps-for-2025/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/default-apps-for-2024/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;year&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/default-apps-for-2023/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been seeing people’s update posts pop up in my feed reader this morning, so it’s time to look at my default apps for this year. There are a few changes this year, as I’ve started a long plan of detangling from major centralised services and moving to more self-hosting and smaller platforms. As before I’ve marked updates with a ✨ emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📨 Mail Client: Apple Mail + web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📮 Mail Server: Fastmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📝 ✨ Notes: &lt;s&gt;Obsidian&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s&gt;LogSeq&lt;/s&gt; Obsidian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;✅ To-Do: Apple Reminders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📷 iPhone Photo Shooting: Apple Camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌅 ✨ Photo Management: Apple Photos, &lt;mark&gt;Immich&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📆 Calendar: Apple Calendar linked to Fastmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📁 ✨ Cloud File Storage: &lt;s&gt;iCloud + OneDrive&lt;/s&gt; &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📖 ✨ RSS: Inoreader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts: Apple Contacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌐 Browser: Edge at work, Vivaldi at home, Safari on Mobile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💬 Chat: Work only - Teams; iMessage + WhatsApp, if they count&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Installing Arch Linux with Secure Boot on a Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio</title>

I’ve removed references to it from the instructions because &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakelazaroff.com/words/dhh-is-way-worse-than-i-thought/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;I should have known better&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully it was one very optional step, and the remaining guide holds up with base Arch. My Surface is now on a vanilla Arch install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My three year-old Surface Laptop Studio (first generation) has been starting to feel a bit long in the tooth as Windows 11 has continued to grow fatter. It’s that slow, creeping, feeling you get when a device isn’t quite “good enough” anymore. You probably know what I mean; things take longer to open than you remember, and there’s just a little bit more “friction” using the device than you’d like. It’s small things - a few extra seconds here, a loading spinner there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I don’t use the Surface all that much now, I didn’t want to leave it in it’s current state. In my experience, there’s few more frustrating computing experiences than coming back to a Windows laptop after you’ve not used it for several weeks/months… only to have it grind to a complete halt when you eventually do power it on as it spends the next hour or more trying to catch-up on updates on the system and applications. So, a switch to Linux was on the cards - ideally lightweight and ready to go for any light dev work I pick it up for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love using Arch Linux. I use a flavour of it on my main desktop PC. It can be time-consuming to install, but it’s (relatively) straightforward, especially if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;follow the Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. But, because we’re talking about Microsoft hardware, it wasn’t the super-simple installation it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have been, but it wasn’t &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; bad. Fiddly enough I figured I’d write it up below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-0-preparation&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/installing-arch-linux-with-secure-boot-on-a-microsoft-surface-laptop-studio/#step-0-preparation&quot;&gt;Step 0: Preparation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing’s first, you’ll need the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://archlinux.org/download/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Arch Linux installation medium&lt;/a&gt; burned to a USB stick. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://rufus.ie/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rufus&lt;/a&gt; to create the installer USB on &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/45NiUkv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a Sandisk Type-C drive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, you will need to disable Secure Boot in the laptop’s firmware. From Windows, hold down the Shift key while clicking on Reboot in the start menu. This will restart you into the firmware control panel. Select Security, then turn off Secure Boot by clicking the “Change configuration” button. Select “None”, then OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;markdown-alert markdown-alert-note&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;markdown-alert-title&quot;&gt;&lt;svg class=&quot;octicon octicon-info mr-2&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M0 8a8 8 0 1 1 16 0A8 8 0 0 1 0 8Zm8-6.5a6.5 6.5 0 1 0 0 13 6.5 6.5 0 0 0 0-13ZM6.5 7.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.25 7h1a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75v2.75h.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-2a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5h.25v-2h-.25a.75.75 0 0 1-.75-.75ZM8 6a1 1 0 1 1 0-2 1 1 0 0 1 0 2Z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Secure Boot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning off Secure Boot will put a big, scary-looking, red bar across the top of your laptop’s boot screen. It’s fine, we’ll fix it in step 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re in the firmware, go back to Boot Configuration and reorder the devices so USB Storage is at the top of the list. I found it a little fiddly to get it to move, but it did eventually drag into the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your installation medium inserted into the laptop, click on Exit, then Restart Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;markdown-alert markdown-alert-warning&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;markdown-alert-title&quot;&gt;&lt;svg class=&quot;octicon octicon-alert mr-2&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M6.457 1.047c.659-1.234 2.427-1.234 3.086 0l6.082 11.378A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 14.082 15H1.918a1.75 1.75 0 0 1-1.543-2.575Zm1.763.707a.25.25 0 0 0-.44 0L1.698 13.132a.25.25 0 0 0 .22.368h12.164a.25.25 0 0 0 .22-.368Zm.53 3.996v2.5a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0v-2.5a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0ZM9 11a1 1 0 1 1-2 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0Z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Warning!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to enable LUKS disk encryption. The built-in keyboard &lt;strong&gt;will not work for entering the encryption key at boot&lt;/strong&gt; until after &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/installing-arch-linux-with-secure-boot-on-a-microsoft-surface-laptop-studio/#step-3-surface-hardware&quot;&gt;Step 3&lt;/a&gt;. You should keep a wired keyboard handy and plugged in to the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-minimal-arch-install&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/installing-arch-linux-with-secure-boot-on-a-microsoft-surface-laptop-studio/#step-1-minimal-arch-install&quot;&gt;Step 1: Minimal Arch Install&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part you can choose what you want. This is the important stuff I chose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For bootloader I “chose” systemd-boot (the default).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disk:	Use the Default partitioning layout, selecting your SSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disk: Choose btrfs with the default structure and compression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disk: Use LUKS disk encryption with a password, selecting the partition created earlier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network: Copy ISO network config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication: Create your account, then set yourself as a Super User&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional packages - I added &lt;code&gt;nano&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sbctl&lt;/code&gt; (see Step 2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-secure-boot&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/installing-arch-linux-with-secure-boot-on-a-microsoft-surface-laptop-studio/#step-2-secure-boot&quot;&gt;Step 2: Secure Boot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part should be possible to do &lt;code&gt;chroot&lt;/code&gt;’d into your system from the install media, but I rebooted and logged in as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secure Boot was the part I struggled with the most, and it genuinely took me &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; to get a working setup. Luckily for you, it should only take a few minutes as a result of that :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the current status of Secure Boot, using &lt;code&gt;sbctl&lt;/code&gt;. It should look similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;sbctl status
Installed:   ✘ Sbctl is not installed
Setup Mode:  ✘ Enabled
Secure Boot: ✘ Disabled&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create custom secure boot keys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;sbctl create-keys
Created Owner UUID 0f5c874c-d63b-43dc-b44f-b10b9340cd45
Creating secure boot keys&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;.✔
Secure boot keys created&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enroll custom secure boot keys, passing the &lt;code&gt;--microsoft&lt;/code&gt; flag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;sbctl enroll-keys &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--microsoft&lt;/span&gt;
Enrolling keys to EFI variables&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;.✔
Enrolled keys to the EFI variables&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the status. It should show as not in setup mode anymore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;sbctl status
Installed:   ✔ Sbctl is installed
Owner GUID:  0f5c874c-d63b-43dc-b44f-b10b9340cd45
Setup Mode:  ✔ Disabled
Secure Boot: ✘ Disabled&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt; Secure Boot is now enabled, but DO NOT reboot yet. You still need to sign the bootloader files, so if you reboot now you won’t be able to load Arch until you turn it off again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sbctl&lt;/code&gt; includes a &lt;code&gt;sign-all&lt;/code&gt; command, but it silently failed for me, and didn’t sign anything. Instead, check which files you need to sign with &lt;code&gt;sbctl verify&lt;/code&gt;. A bunch of .img files might be listed as errors, but in my experience, that’s fine; I’ve removed them from the output below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;sbctl verify
✘ /boot/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI is not signed
✘ /boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi is not signed
✘ /boot/vmlinuz-linux is not signed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign each of those files in turn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;sbctl sign /boot/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI
sbctl sign /boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi
sbctl sign /boot/vmlinuz-linux&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be everything you need. It was for me, anyway. The best part is: future kernel updates will automatically be signed, so you shouldn’t need touch this again. &lt;code&gt;sbctl verify&lt;/code&gt; should show the files as signed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;sbctl verify
✔ /boot/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI is signed
✔ /boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi is signed
✔ /boot/vmlinuz-linux is signed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add an entry for &lt;code&gt;linux-surface-fallback&lt;/code&gt; if you want, b ut I didn’t bother. At this stage, it should be safe to reboot. Arch should load, and the big red bar should be gone. Login as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; for Step 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-surface-hardware&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/installing-arch-linux-with-secure-boot-on-a-microsoft-surface-laptop-studio/#step-3-surface-hardware&quot;&gt;Step 3: Surface Hardware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only been concerned with getting the keyboard/trackpad working, so haven’t properly tested things like the webcam yet. The touchscreen seems to work, but I’ve done the most basic of checking. Refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;linux-surface Wiki&lt;/a&gt; if you need help with any of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-the-kernel-repository-and-install-packages&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/installing-arch-linux-with-secure-boot-on-a-microsoft-surface-laptop-studio/#add-the-kernel-repository-and-install-packages&quot;&gt;Add the Kernel Repository and Install Packages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Refer to the Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for the latest steps. The steps I followed are repeated below for posterity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you need to import the keys we use to sign packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/master/pkg/keys/surface.asc &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; pacman-key &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--add&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to check and verify the fingerprint of the key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;pacman-key &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--finger&lt;/span&gt; 56C464BAAC421453&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you must locally sign the imported key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;pacman-key --lsign-key 56C464BAAC421453&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now add the repository by adding the following to the end of /etc/pacman.conf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-plaintext&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext&quot;&gt;[linux-surface]
Server = https://pkg.surfacelinux.com/arch/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing that you need to refresh the repository metadata, then you can install the linux-surface kernel and its dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;pacman &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-Syu&lt;/span&gt;
pacman &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-S&lt;/span&gt; linux-surface linux-surface-headers iptsd libcamera libcamera-tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-the-boot-loader-entries&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/installing-arch-linux-with-secure-boot-on-a-microsoft-surface-laptop-studio/#add-the-boot-loader-entries&quot;&gt;Add the Boot Loader Entries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I went with the Arch default of Systemd-boot for the bootloader, so this step might not be needed if you chose the recommended Limine. I can’t help you with that, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systemd-boot doesn’t auto-detect new kernels like I remember GRUB doing in other distros, and it is configured differently to the GRUB I’ve used to since my youth&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/installing-arch-linux-with-secure-boot-on-a-microsoft-surface-laptop-studio/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This means we have a little work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, list out the entries you do have, which will probably be just the defaults:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-l&lt;/span&gt; /boot/loader/entries

&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2025&lt;/span&gt;-08-24_08-39-03_linux-fallback.conf
&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2025&lt;/span&gt;-08-24_08-39-03_linux.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the &lt;code&gt;..._linux.conf&lt;/code&gt; file to &lt;code&gt;..._linux-surface.conf&lt;/code&gt;, then open it to edit&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/installing-arch-linux-with-secure-boot-on-a-microsoft-surface-laptop-studio/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cp&lt;/span&gt; /boot/loader/entries/2025-08-24_08-39-03_linux.conf /boot/loader/entries/2025-08-24_08-39-03_linux-surface.conf
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;nano&lt;/span&gt; /boot/loader/entries/2025-08-24_08-39-03_linux-surface.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the file, edit the title, then update the paths to the correct vmlinuz and img files. Mine looks like this (I’ve omitted any lines I didn’t edit, so leave the rest of the file as-is, especially the &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; line):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-plaintext&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext&quot;&gt;title   Arch Linux (linux-surface) 
linux   /vmlinuz-linux-surface
initrd  /initramfs-linux-surface.img&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save and exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;enable-the-keyboard-for-luks-decryption&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/installing-arch-linux-with-secure-boot-on-a-microsoft-surface-laptop-studio/#enable-the-keyboard-for-luks-decryption&quot;&gt;Enable the Keyboard for LUKS Decryption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must be booted into the &lt;code&gt;linux-surface&lt;/code&gt; kernel for the next steps to work, so if you haven’t already, reboot and be sure to select the correct kernel in the boot menu. You can check if you’re in the right kernel with &lt;code&gt;uname -a&lt;/code&gt; - if you are, it will have &lt;code&gt;surface&lt;/code&gt; somewhere in the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabling the keyboard early enough that it can be used to enter the LUKS password requires editing how kernel modules are loaded, then regenerating the kernel image. This sounds scarier than it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/mkinitcpio.conf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;nano&lt;/span&gt; /etc/mkinitcpio.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer to this page on Disk Encryption in the linux-surface documentation for what you need to add to the &lt;code&gt;MODULES=()&lt;/code&gt; section. For thoroughness, I added basically everything, so my entry looks something like this (I’ve removed unrelated entries that were already there):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;MODULES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pinctrl_tigerlake surface_aggregator surface_aggregator_registry surface_aggregator_hub surface_hid_core surface_hid surface_kbd intel_lpss_pci 8250_dw&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regenerate your kernel images:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;mkinitcpio &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will churn away for quite some time, but eventually you’ll be returned to the prompt. You can restart now, and &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to type the LUKS decryption password with the built-in keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Login as your regular user (e.g. &lt;code&gt;chris&lt;/code&gt;, or whatever) and continue on installing and configuring Arch to your desired state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, seriously. I first encountered GRUB in circa 1997. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/installing-arch-linux-with-secure-boot-on-a-microsoft-surface-laptop-studio/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The datetime file name prefix probably isn’t required, but it had taken so long to get to this point I didn’t even think about using the basic &lt;code&gt;linux-surface.conf&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/installing-arch-linux-with-secure-boot-on-a-microsoft-surface-laptop-studio/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Migrating An Eleventy Site to Bunny.Net</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/migrating-an-eleventy-site-to-bunnynet/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a while back that &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/i-rebuilt-my-blog-and-didnt-write-about-it/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;I was hosting the images for this blog on Azure&lt;/a&gt;. After I wrote that post &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/sending-webmentions-after-deploying-to-azure-static-web-apps/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;I moved the site wholesale over to Azure Static Web Apps&lt;/a&gt; (SWA), and the site has been running pretty smoothly since. Unfortunately, Azure are deprecating the particular CDN service I was using, and the alternatives looked Enterprise-grade expensive. The actual switch-off wasn’t happening until 2027, but I know what I’m like: I’d forget and then have to rush to fix my broken site all of a sudden. So moving sooner rather than later seemed the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took it as an opportunity to reduce my reliance on US Tech firms and diversify out a bit. I’m not exactly “Anti Big Tech”, but trust has been eroding for a while and I like to be pragmatic about these things. I recently switched my primary desktop to Linux, but that’s a story for another day. But anyway, to cut a long story much shorter: I settled on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bunny.net/?ref=p6szzw7737&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bunny.Net for storage and CDN&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest of this post is describing what that entailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-the-cdn&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/migrating-an-eleventy-site-to-bunnynet/#moving-the-cdn&quot;&gt;Moving the CDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest job (I thought) was always going to be moving the 6.5GB of images I had in Azure and setting up the new CDN. Thankfully, it ended up being almost comically easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Azure Storage Explorer to download the relevant blob containers to my local computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Bunny Storage Zone and get the access details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Filezilla to upload the files to the Storage Zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new CDN “Pull Zone” pointing at the Storage Zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a new hostname pointing to the Pull Zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify files were loading OK from the CDN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find-and-replace the old CDN URL for the new one across all post files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit the file changes, commit, and let CI/CD deploy the blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site itself was still on Azure at this point, but all image assets had seamlessly transferred over and were being served by Bunny. I turned on “smart” caching and Bunny Shield (their Web Application Firewall offering) in Basic mode, and job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-the-site&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/migrating-an-eleventy-site-to-bunnynet/#moving-the-site&quot;&gt;Moving the Site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving the site itself to Bunny was going to be a very similar process. The main sticking point was replacing the convenient CI/CD process that builds and deploys the site. Every time I check in a change and push it to the repository a process is kicked off which runs the build script and deploys the output to the target service. SWA sets this up automatically for you as a GitHub Action. It made sense to create a new Action to do much the same, just with Bunny as the deployment target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First though, I created a new Storage Zone and associated Pull Zone. I didn’t add the hostname for the site to the Pull Zone yet though - I wanted to be sure everything was working fine before finalising the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not overly familiar with writing GitHub Actions, but I get the concepts and the basics. After a bit of digging around on the Internet I landed on an Action which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Bunny.Net Deployment CI/CD

&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; develop
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;repository_dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;function_trigger&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;build_and_deploy_job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; github.event_name == &#39;push&#39; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; github.event_name == &#39;repository_dispatch&#39;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;latest
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Build and Deploy Job
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/checkout@v4

          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;storageEndpoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;uk.storage.bunnycdn.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;accessKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;${{ secrets.ACCESS_KEY }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;pullZoneId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;${{ secrets.ZONE_ID }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;upload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;purgePullZone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;purgePullZoneDelay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;15&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses the action &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ayeressian/bunnycdn-storage-deploy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ayeressian/bunnycdn-storage-deploy&lt;/a&gt; to do the heavy lifting of interacting with the Bunny API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some test deployments to both Bunny and Azure for a while. Once I was happy everything was working as expected, DNS was switched from pointing to Azure to pointing to Bunny. And everything (pretty much) worked out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-few-tweaks&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/migrating-an-eleventy-site-to-bunnynet/#a-few-tweaks&quot;&gt;A Few Tweaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SWA uses a JSON configuration file to let you tweak various settings like HTTP headers and add any redirects. Bunny doesn’t use an equivalent file, but does let you set Edge Rules through the dashboard. I added several for security-related headers, then one which handled redirecting some old feed URLs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/follow/blog/feed.atom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the current one&lt;/a&gt;. Adding these was simple enough, but having to repeat the process for every site I migrate from here-on might get tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t turn on Smart Cache for the blog itself, as it turns out that by default the CDN caches everything anyway, whereas Smart Cache &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.bunny.net/hc/en-us/articles/5779976842770-Understanding-Smart-Cache&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;doesn’t include HTML files&lt;/a&gt;. I did turn on the Shield WAF as the site was instantly swarmed by bots looking for sensitive files. There’s nothing for them to find, but better safe than sorry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that done, everything was migrated, with everything running extremely smoothly from my point of view. In fact, it went so well I’ve already migrated my &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.photos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Photo Blog&lt;/a&gt; too!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Paint, Same Blog</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/new-paint-same-blog/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to redo the theme of this site for a while. I had some specific ideas in mind, but no cohesive vision. Then I thought to myself - “why don’t I base it on the editor theme I enjoy using so much and spend most of my day looking at?” Or something like that. And so, after a couple of evenings hacking away at the CSS, &lt;code&gt;https://chrismcleod.dev&lt;/code&gt; has a new, fresh coat of paint.&lt;/p&gt;

The title &#39;Sometimes, Whimsy is Enough&#39; appears in a large, light blue-white font. At the top of the page, the navigation menu includes &#39;Blog&#39; in pink/salmon, &#39;Paintslam&#39; in brown/copper, &#39;Follow&#39; in green, and &#39;About&#39; in light blue, all on the dark navy background. The post is dated January 24, 2025 by Chris McLeod, whose name also appears in the header with a small abstract explosion icon&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colour pallete is &lt;a href=&quot;https://catppuccin.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Catppuccin&lt;/a&gt;. In light mode, the Latté style is used, and in dark mode, Machiatto. You can use the theme switcher in the footer to try them out, if you want. It’s all made possible with CSS variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted to inject more colour across the site than I used previously, so I’ve made use of several in the predefined sets. Where there are UI items which repeat several times - the navbar link, tags in the archive, etc. - I cycle through the colours to approximate a rainbow. The code for this was surprisingly concise, using the &lt;code&gt;:nth-of-type()&lt;/code&gt; selector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.button:nth-of-type(7n+1)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* set red properties */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;--button-border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--color-red&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.button:nth-of-type(7n+2)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* set orange properties. &quot;peach&quot; is the closest in Catppuccin */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;--button-border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--color-peach&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* repeat for the rest… */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.button:nth-of-type(7n+7)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* set violet properties. &quot;mauve&quot; is the closest in Catppuccin */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;--button-border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--color-mauve&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will start with red, cycle to “violet” (classic ROY G BIV), then start repeating the pattern infinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonts were another thing I had an idea for coming in. I was pretty sure I wanted to use a monospace font. I view myself as my blog’s primary audience, so it made sense to optimise for my own reading preferences. Hopefully it works as well for others. The main body font is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;iA Writer Duo, which is the editor font I use for writing Markdown files, while iA Writer Quattro is used for headings&lt;/a&gt;. To provide some visual variation, code samples use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cascadia Code&lt;/a&gt;, which is the main font I use in my editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood everything is still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Eleventy Excellent&lt;/a&gt; starter (it’s still my lightly hacked v1 for now, rather than the latest v4). I enjoyed the layout and typography of Eleventy Excellent, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lenesaile.com/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lene&lt;/a&gt; has built a great foundation to work off of, so I didn’t feel the need to rip up the foundations. Pretty much all I’ve done is apply some new colours and move things around without changing much of anything in the HTML - which feels very much like how HTML and CSS &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Follower Count</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/follower-count/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last 2-3 months I’ve been running an experiment on my use of social media. I wanted to see what works best for me now, compared to assumptions I’ve carried for the last few years. For the last several years (since around 2017 or so…) I’ve been conservative on the number of accounts I follow on any given platform. “Carefully curated”, you might say. Mainly this was so I didn’t feel overwhelmed trying to keep up with every update in a busy feed. As the social media landscape got progressively worse, it seemed a prescient choice. It’s worked well for me, but it’s always good to see if another way could be better. The rise of Bluesky gave me the opportunity to try something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://social.lol/@chrisplusplus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;On Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, I kept to my usual “follow only select accounts you know and enjoy, adding new follows rarely” approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, over &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/chrismcleod.dev&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;on Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, I threw some of that caution to the wind and followed with wild abandon&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/follower-count/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, using Starter Packs for subjects I enjoy to give me a head-start. I was still reviewing these starter packs and their creator, so I wasn’t following accounts completely blind, but I wasn’t being cautious with the number of accounts I followed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands, I follow ~150 accounts on Mastodon, and ~900 on Bluesky. I also follow some tags on Mastodon, so that adds a little bit extra variety on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve come to the conclusion that on these no/less alorithm-driven platforms &lt;strong&gt;I prefer following more accounts&lt;/strong&gt;, though I could probably trim the Bluesky number down &lt;em&gt;a bit&lt;/em&gt;. The higher follower count just makes for a much more varied and lively feed, which feels more enjoyable. After a bit of adjustment, don’t feel the need anymore to read every update I might have missed. I just dip in and absorb what’s there in the moment, then dip out. Custom feeds such as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vpkhqolt662uhesyj6nxm7ys/feed/infreq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Quiet Posters&lt;/a&gt;” help too. On Mastodon I see most updates from those I follow, as the numbers are relatively low, but it’s easy for the feed to be dominated by 1 particular account or topic at a time, and this doesn’t feel great - particularly at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I guess I need to start ramping up my following activity on the fediverse. There currently aren’t fully integrated starter packs to make that easier - though there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/32946&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedidevs.com/starter-packs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;3rd-party tools&lt;/a&gt; out there to change that - so for now I’ll have to do that the old fashioned way: discovery and recommendations. &lt;em&gt;Hint, hint&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still don’t do the automatic follow back thing though. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/rahaeli.bsky.social/post/3layll67et22y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;That’s how you get disinfo campaigns&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/follower-count/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Visual Studio Code Snippet for Markdown Frontmatter</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/visual-studio-code-snippet-for-markdown-frontmatter/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to setup, but I &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; added a snippet to VSCode for inserting Frontmatter into a Markdown file - handy for e.g, adding a new post to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://11ty.dev/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt;-powered blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add a snippet, press &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-Shift-P&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;F1&lt;/code&gt;, then select “Configure Snippetts”. Decide where you want to create the snippit - it can be at the project-level, language-level, or global. I chose language, so selected Markdown. Next, define your snippet in the JSON file. For me, this was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;post frontmatter&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;prefix&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;fm&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;body&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;---&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;title: $1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;date: $CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-${CURRENT_DATE}T$CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE:$CURRENT_SECOND$CURRENT_TIMEZONE_OFFSET&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;id: $UUID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;tags:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;  - $2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;---&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;$0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;description&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Post frontmatter&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this does, is generate some frontmatter data whenever I type &lt;code&gt;fm&lt;/code&gt; in a markdown document and then &lt;code&gt;tab&lt;/code&gt; to insert the snippet. It automatically adds the current date and time, and puts the cursor at the first tab-stop, ready to type my title. Pressing &lt;code&gt;tab&lt;/code&gt; again puts the cursor to the tags field, and a final &lt;code&gt;tab&lt;/code&gt; puts the cursor into the document body, ready to write. To use this post as an example, the output will be something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token front-matter-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token front-matter yaml language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Visual Studio Code Snippet for Markdown Frontmatter
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token datetime number&quot;&gt;2025-01-27T14:40:16+00:00&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; dd31b3bf&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;93c8&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;4d91&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;85f3&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;0f59dce4466f
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; markdown
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; vscode
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; eleventy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about VSCode snippets and what you can do with them in &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the official docs&lt;/a&gt;. There were a lot more built-in variables than I realised, which has let me uninstall 2 extensions already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering what the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; field in the frontmatter is for: I’ve been loosely tracking the conversation around what makes a good identifier in a feed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://darthmall.net/2025/on-the-importance-of-stable-ids/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Evan kicked it off&lt;/a&gt;, then Bob &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bobmonsour.com/til/much-more-to-come-on-rss-entry-ids/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;continued it on&lt;/a&gt;. Even though I haven’t made any changes to my feeds yet, I didn’t see any harm in pre-emptively adding the data, in case I do. However, Evan noted this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… the ID does have to be a URI, so you can’t — as I initially planned to do — just chuck a UUID in there and call it a day …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to get all “well, ackchyually…”, &lt;em&gt;but you kinda can&lt;/em&gt;. It just needs to use the &lt;code&gt;urn:uuid&lt;/code&gt; URI scheme like so: &lt;code&gt;urn:uuid:dd31b3bf-93c8-4d91-85f3-0f59dce4466f&lt;/code&gt;. This is something I learned about on The Underground&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/visual-studio-code-snippet-for-markdown-frontmatter/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, when several people helpfully reached out to tell me about it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheunderground.blog%2Ffeed-uuid.xml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;You can see it in the validator&lt;/a&gt;. Evan has decided to use the tag scheme for his blog, so it’s maybe a moot point, but I wanted to mention it in case it helps others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am &lt;em&gt;painfully&lt;/em&gt; aware I haven’t written there in a very long time. No, I don’t know when that might change. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/visual-studio-code-snippet-for-markdown-frontmatter/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Sometimes, Whimsy is Enough</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/sometimes-whimsy-is-enough/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a bit in the doldrums this week. It’s never fun when your health suddenly changes, especially when it decides to do it in a terrifying  manner. But that’s for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of all this kerfuffle, I’ve been sat at home most of the week “to rest”. Rest, for me, takes a few different forms; if I’m in the mood, I’ll maybe play a video game, or I’ll work on a hobby project, or I’ll tinker around on a coding project — which, to the outside observer doesn’t really look any different to “work”. Guess where my head landed this week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever keeps us occupied, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the last several hours faffing around with Rust, and GitHub Actions (mostly on the Actions part, TBH) to create a command line utility with it’s own CI/CD pipeline for building and releases. And what does this utility do? Is it anything useful? Or groundbreaking? You read the title of this post, didn’t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it doesn’t do anything useful. What it &lt;em&gt;does do&lt;/em&gt;, is take a date and time, and convert it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Imperial_Dating_System&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the date format used by the Imperium of Man in the game Warhammer 40,000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/sometimes-whimsy-is-enough/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Why? Because sometimes making something silly, just for the sake of it, is enough to make you feel a little bit better about everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;grimdate &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# output: 0 064 025.M3//10:53 local&lt;/span&gt;
grimdate --no-spaces &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# output: 0064025.M3//10:54 local&lt;/span&gt;
grimdate --is-iss &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# output: 1 064 025.M3//10:54 local&lt;/span&gt;
grimdate &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;1999-10-05T15:30:00+03:00&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# output: 0 759 999.M2//12:30 local&lt;/span&gt;
grimdate --no-time &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# output: 0 064 025.M3&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# options can be combined, e.g.,&lt;/span&gt;
grimdate &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-iSTd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;2023-10-05T15:30:00+03:00&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# output: 1759023.M3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went a bit further and wrapped a dumb ZSH function around it so it gets output to my terminal as a rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function-name function&quot;&gt;grim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;$&#39;&lt;span class=&quot;token entity&quot; title=&quot;&#92;e&quot;&gt;&#92;e&lt;/span&gt;[31m&#39;&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Bridge Your Fediverse Accounts to Bluesky with a Custom Domain Handle</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/bridge-your-fediverse-accounts-to-bluesky-with-a-custom-domain-handle/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarbird.net/blog/2025/01/09/lets-all-go-to-the-exit/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a blog post that reminded me that I had intended to bridge my fediverse accounts&lt;/a&gt; to Bluesky using Bridgy Fed. I tend to cross-post most “micro blog” text posts to both Mastodon and Bluesky anyway, but occaisionally I post something to one place or the other. Plus, I’ve just setup a Pixelfed account for photo sharing and it turns out you can bridge that in the exact same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside is the default bridged user handles are really long and unweildy, which makes them a pain to share. But after digging through &lt;a href=&quot;https://fed.brid.gy/docs#bluesky-enhanced&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Bridgy Fed documentation&lt;/a&gt;, it turns out you can still use &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a custom domain handle for&lt;/a&gt; these bridged accounts, which makes them much easier to share. My fediverse accounts are now bridged as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/masto.chrismcleod.social&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;masto.chrismcleod.social&lt;/a&gt; for Mastodon posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/pixelfed.chrismcleod.social&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pixelfed.chrismcleod.social&lt;/a&gt; for Pixelfed posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things you’ll need, if you want to do this for your own accounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one or more fediverse accounts you want people on Bluesky to be able to interact with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you’ll need a domain name you can use, and know how to create records for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-bridge-your-account&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/bridge-your-fediverse-accounts-to-bluesky-with-a-custom-domain-handle/#step-1-bridge-your-account&quot;&gt;Step 1. Bridge Your Account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the really easy bit: follow the account &lt;code&gt;@bsky.brid.gy@bsky.brid.gy&lt;/code&gt; from the fediverse account you want to bridge. After a few seconds you should receive a private mention/DM from the account letting you know the bridge account has been created on Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;

It includes a URL to the bridged profile and links to documentation and the user page for more information. The message also explains how to disable the bridge by blocking the account.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll see by default the account handle is something like &lt;code&gt;your-username.your-fedi-server.com.ap.brid.gy&lt;/code&gt;, which is a bit long-winded! Don’t worry, in the following steps we’ll fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

Create the DNS Records for a Custom Domain Handle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the link to your Bridgy Fed user page in the message you just received. On the page that loads, click the 🏷️ icon:&lt;/p&gt;

It displays the user’s name, handle (@chrisplusplus@social.lol), and associated Bluesky handle. There are buttons for “Profile” and “Notifications,” as well as links showing activity, followers, and following counts. The image highlights a tag icon. Links to “Docs,” “News,” “Code,” and “Issues” are present at the top.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will copy the DID of the Bluesky account to the clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, load up what ever control panel you use to create DNS records for the domain you want to use. We’re going to create a TXT record for the custom domain handle you want to use for the account, but prefixed with &lt;code&gt;_atproto.&lt;/code&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want your custom handle to be the root domain &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;, you will create a record for &lt;code&gt;_atproto.example.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to use a subdomain — e.g., &lt;code&gt;fedi.example.com&lt;/code&gt;, you will create &lt;code&gt;_atproto.fedi.example.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I wanted to use &lt;code&gt;masto.chrismcleod.social&lt;/code&gt; as an account handle, so created &lt;code&gt;_atproto.masto.chrismcleod.social&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the TXT record is &lt;code&gt;did=&amp;lt;the did you copied from brid.gy&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The “VALUE” field contains a DID string (did=did:plc:x...), and the “HOSTNAME” field is set to _atproto.masto. The TTL (Time to Live) is set to 3600 seconds. The interface includes a button labeled “Create Record” for saving the entry.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the record. Depending on the vagaries of DNS, this record might take anywhere from a few seconds to several hours to start working. You can check if you’re ready to proceed by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky-debug.app/handle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bluesky Debug&lt;/a&gt; and checking the handle:&lt;/p&gt;

The user has entered “masto.chrismcleod.social” in the input field and clicked “Debug handle.” A green notification bar at the bottom confirms that “masto.chrismcleod.social” passed verification via DNS. Links to “How to set your domain as your handle” and “Handle resolution docs” are also visible.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your handle is resolving, you can move on to the final step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixelfed DMs/private mentions don’t seem to support links when I tested this out earlier. Once you’ve received the DM from Bridgy Fed, to get the DID to enter into the DNS record, you’ll need to enter your Pixelfed account (e.g., &lt;code&gt;your-account@pixelfed.social&lt;/code&gt;) on &lt;a href=&quot;https://fed.brid.gy/user-page&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It prompts the user to “Enter your handle, user id, or website” in a text input field. The user has entered “chrismcleod.dev@pixelfed.social” in the field. There is an “OK” button next to the input field. Links to “Docs,” “News,” “Code,” and “Issues” are displayed at the top right.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will load your user page and you can get your DID to proceed with creating your DNS record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly there. Here comes the hardest step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reply to the DM/private mention from &lt;code&gt;@bsky.brid.gy@bsky.brid.gy&lt;/code&gt; with a message containing &lt;code&gt;username &amp;lt;your new handle&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For example, I sent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-plaintext&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext&quot;&gt;username masto.chrismcleod.social&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it! After a few seconds, Bridgy will reply to let you know it’s been a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, after a few moments you should be able to see the update reflected on the Bluesky interface:&lt;/p&gt;

The username “@masto.chrismcleod.social” is highlighted. The profile includes a description: “Online since before some of you were born. Tired. Lead Software Developer, but I’m not allowed to talk about it. He/him/his. Scotland.” It also mentions that the account is bridged from “social.lol/@chrisplusplus” on the Fediverse by “fed.brid.gy.” The profile shows 1 follower, 0 following, and 5 posts. A “Bridgy User” badge is visible.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this short guide helps you get your own bridged accounts setup with easier to use custom handles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I&#39;m Doing Advent Of Code in 2024</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/how-im-doing-advent-of-code-in-2024/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://adventofcode.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Advent Of Code&lt;/a&gt; has been around for ages. It’s one of those things that I’ve always wanted to do, but never managed to get into the groove of. I’d maybe do the first puzzle, maybe even a couple of days, but eventually the time of year would overtake me and it would fall by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year is a little different. We’re currently eight days through, and I’m fully up-to-date with all of the challenges. Full gold stars and everything. This is after coming into it five days late and needing to catch up. The difference has been that I’m not the only person I know who is taking part. AOC has caught on at work and there are people in my immediate network - on my direct team, even - all taking part and talking about it. We even have a private leaderboard&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/how-im-doing-advent-of-code-in-2024/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Turns out that friendly competition can be a decent motivator for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how am I actually completing the challenges? This is the “stack” I’m using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C# and .NET 8/9. (I didn’t get my environment upgraded to 9 until partway through)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mix of VS Code and “full fat” Visual Studio. I keep meaning to try Rider too, now it’s free, but I haven’t yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A .NET Console project for the actual puzzle, and an MSTest project for unit tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Powershell function to setup my stub project each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last one was actually pretty key. .NET has come a long way recently, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the CLI tool&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;pretty great&lt;/em&gt;, but for the first few days I was having to follow process of around a dozen steps to get the project setup I wanted. It was frustrating. I’ve included the function below. As much so I can easily copy it to my work laptop tomorrow as for sharing 😅. Using the function makes getting started as simple as &lt;code&gt;New-AdventOfCodeProject&lt;/code&gt; with optional parameters for the year and day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have gone with JavaScript or something and avoided all that initial palaver with an &lt;code&gt;npm init -y&lt;/code&gt; or similar, but sometimes I feel like I don’t write enough C# any more; it’s mostly JavaScript at work these days, so AOC is an ideal time to stretch some neglected muscles. Maybe even some new ones? It would be an ideal opportunity… Regardless, I’m really enjoying using C# for these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as actual approach, I guess I’m essentially using TDD (Test Driven Development). The description gives you everything you need to create at least one unit test using the sample input and expected answer. Apart from the first couple of puzzles, I’ve started with writing this test before any implementation code. From there it’s a case of writing code to pass that unit test. Once the unit test is passing I add code to my programme to load the input from a text file and pass it to my processing code. Sometimes the real input will throw up edge cases I hadn’t thought of&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/how-im-doing-advent-of-code-in-2024/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so there will be some rework, but it’s all part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of structure I usually have 3 files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Program.cs&lt;/code&gt; - main application file, does the writing to the console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;input.txt&lt;/code&gt; - puzzle input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Day&amp;lt;whatever&amp;gt;.cs&lt;/code&gt; - a class file which does the actual processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the class file the code is usually along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;AdventOfCode24Day8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;DayEight&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Keep a copy of our original puzzle input around&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; _originalInput&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Constructor&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;DayEight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; input&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    _originalInput &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; input&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Part One setup and processing&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token return-type class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;PartOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Anything specific to processing part one&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// pre-processing the input, etc...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;PuzzleSolvingEntryPoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;_originalInput&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Method that actually kicks off the processing.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Usually named something more relevant to the puzzle&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token return-type class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;PuzzleSolvingEntryPoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Any helper methods, etc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach has been evolving over the last eight days I’ve been taking part, and will probably keep evolving over the remaining days of Advent. The first few days were definitely a bit more “scrappy”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the console, the programme is outputting a welcome and then the answer to each part as I complete it. I could probably get fancier, but one of my goals was to keep things as simple as possible. If it doesn’t take me much time then I’m more likely to stick with it. A very basic console app is perfect for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-elephant-in-the-room&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/how-im-doing-advent-of-code-in-2024/#the-elephant-in-the-room&quot;&gt;The Elephant in the Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about AI? Couldn’t I get something to solve these puzzles for me? Well, yes, I likely could. I think I’m pretty good at “Prompt Engineering”, so could probably make it happen. But doing so would completely ruin the point of it all for me. I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an Anti-AI purist. I think every software engineer should make best use of all the tools they have available to solve the problem in front of them as best they can. If Copilot wants to autocomplete parts of the method I’m writing and it looks like what I was about to type out manually&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/how-im-doing-advent-of-code-in-2024/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; anyway, then I’m hitting the Tab key. But there are certain things &lt;em&gt;I want to do&lt;/em&gt;. Solving the problem of the day for Advent Of Code is one of them. So while I’ll accept an autocomplete, I’m not asking the chat for the solution. I’m not heading off to ChatGPT, or Gemini, or something else, to feed the entire puzzle details in to get the answer. It would ruin the fun for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once I’ve solved it and got my two stars for the day? Then I will happily query an LLM about the problem. I’ll compare how it approaches getting to a solution. Usually it takes a bit of iterative prompting to get it onto the right track, but that’s part of the challenge of AI tooling. Yesterday, as I was beginning to read a book on how to write Rust, I threw my C# solution into Claude, to see what an equivalent Rust implementation would look like. It was useful as a learning exercise - and, yes, Claude’s conversion did run successfully and produce the correct answers. I doubt it was an optimal conversion, but it did work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally, I might use an LLM to help me with an “extra assignment” after the puzzle was finished with. Day six had a puzzle that was ripe for a console-based visualisation, so I got to work with Copilot over lunch to bring it to life. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/chrismcleod.dev/post/3lcnpp74wls23&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;see the results in a 30 second clip over on Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be putting all my solutions on GitHub eventually. A couple already are, but the rest are spread across multiple different computers right now, and I’d need to add proper &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; files and the like to half of them, so it may take me a while. I’d also want to post them publicly with a bit of a lag, to prevent spoiling the answer for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, now I’m finally taking part properly I’m enjoying Advent Of Code. A lot. Or maybe I’m enjoying rapidly climbing up our private leaderboard, I don’t know. But if you’ve thought about taking part but just haven’t for whatever reason, I do recommend giving it a shot. Treat it as a bit of no-stakes problem solving. Like Wordle, or the crossword or something. You might enjoy it too. I’ve been enjoying the coding brain-teaser format enough that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pragprog.com/titles/csharpbt/c-brain-teasers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;I bought myself a whole book of them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s that PowerShell function I mentioned near the start. It’s simple but long, hence why I put it down here and out of the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;New-AdventOfCodeProject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;[int]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$Year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;[int]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$Day&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$PSBoundParameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ContainsKey&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Year&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$Year&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Get-Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Year &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; 100
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$PSBoundParameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ContainsKey&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Day&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$Day&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;[int]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Get-Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Day

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the autocomplete prompts I get are code relevant to previous years.

      <title>Next steps with Bluesky - hosting your own data and more on the API</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/next-steps-with-bluesky-hosting-your-own-data-and-more-on-the-api/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I wrote about Bluesky. My previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/a-hello-world-for-bluesky/the-at-protocol/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;“Hello World” for Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; was a quick overview of using the APIs to authenticate and post to Bluesky. It remains a popular post all these months later, and several people have let me know it helped get up and running with integrating with the AT protocol (ATproto) network&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/next-steps-with-bluesky-hosting-your-own-data-and-more-on-the-api/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which includes the Bluesky service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, ATproto/Bluesky have been growing a lot lately, and things have moved on very fast. Everything in that previous post still holds up and works, but there have been some interesting developments that warrant an update, namely: you can now host your own data. It’s pretty straightforward too. It does have some implications for working with the APIs, which I’ll get to shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hosting-your-own-atproto/bluesky-data-and-why-you-might-want-to&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/next-steps-with-bluesky-hosting-your-own-data-and-more-on-the-api/#hosting-your-own-atproto/bluesky-data-and-why-you-might-want-to&quot;&gt;Hosting your own ATproto/Bluesky data, and why you might want to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big gripes against Bluesky is that it looks like another corporately owned social media network and not as open or federated as, say, Mastodon. That’s partially true in my view&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/next-steps-with-bluesky-hosting-your-own-data-and-more-on-the-api/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but the situation is improving. The thing to remember is that it works in a different way to ActivityPub/Mastodon. The common comparison is ActivityPub = email, ATproto = websites. There’s a bit more to it that I’m not getting into right now, but there’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenewstack.io/blueskys-at-protocol-pros-and-cons-for-developers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;decent write-up by Rich MacManus on The New Stack&lt;/a&gt;. The important bit to understand is there are a few important components to ATproto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://plc.directory/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;identifier directory&lt;/a&gt; - think of it as ICANN in the network; currently centralised and owned by the Bluesky corp, but they say they are looking to spin this out into a standalone entity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#relay&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/a&gt; - collects and caches data from the network, a bit like an RSS aggregator; you can self-host this if you want, but it’s harder/more resource intensive, so the “main” one is controlled by the Bluesky corp but there are others out there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#app-view&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;AppView&lt;/a&gt; - apps that view/post data in the network; you can self-host/build your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#pds-personal-data-server&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PDS&lt;/a&gt; - where data is stored, such as user info and posts. Previously these were all controlled by the Bluesky corp, but now you can host your own and it’s very straightforward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PDS is the bit we’re interested in right now. It’s where all your data is stored. When you self-host a PDS you can still use Bluesky the service, but all your posts and user information is stored on a server you control. I set mine up and it took roughly 20 minutes from start to finish (including DNS!) by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://rafaeleyng.github.io/self-hosting-a-bluesky-pds-and-using-your-domain-as-your-handle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this guide by Rafael Eyng&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://atproto.com/guides/self-hosting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The official guide&lt;/a&gt; has you covered if you don’t want to use the exact same setup as described by Rafael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already have an account on Bluesky that’s using their PDS servers (the default), you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://whtwnd.com/bnewbold.net/3l5ii332pf32u&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;migrate to your self-hosted PDS&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a little more involved, but still reasonably straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do this? The first is exercising that little bit of control over your data - you own the server, so you can back it up, export it, migrate it, etc, whenever you want to. If the Bluesky app goes down then you can still post to your PDS and it will appear on the network through other AppViews until Bluesky comes back online. If Bluesky corp ever goes full-Elon then your data is isolated. Assuming other Relays and AppViews come online then everyone can technically carry on by using “Greensky” or whatever alternative comes along. Some of &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/next-steps-with-bluesky-hosting-your-own-data-and-more-on-the-api/selhost&quot;&gt;the developers are looking for volunteers&lt;/a&gt; to help prove this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-does-this-mean-if-im-using-the-apis-to-interact-with-bluesky/atproto&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/next-steps-with-bluesky-hosting-your-own-data-and-more-on-the-api/#so-what-does-this-mean-if-im-using-the-apis-to-interact-with-bluesky/atproto&quot;&gt;So what does this mean if I’m using the APIs to interact with Bluesky/ATproto?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my limited testing, only a few 3rd-party apps are currently accounting for self-hosted PDS scenarios, so authenticating and e.g., posting doesn’t work. It’s improving though. The nice thing is, fixing this is reasonably straightforward from an API point of view. Simply put - you need to direct all API requests to the user’s PDS instead of the Bluesky service (or other ATproto service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, I’ve moved to using my own PDS at &lt;a href=&quot;https://pds.chrismcleod.social/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://pds.chrismcleod.social&lt;/a&gt;, so that is where clients should send authentication requests to. Everything else about the request looks the same as it did, so if I update an example from my previous post, authenticating to my PDS will look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;https://pds.chrismcleod.social/xrpc/com.atproto.server.createSession&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;{
    &quot;identifier&quot;: &quot;chrismcleod.dev&quot;,
    &quot;password&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;some-password&gt;&quot;
}&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the response looks the same as before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the frontend/user flow, you need to capture the PDS location somehow. It’s technically possible to &lt;a href=&quot;https://atproto.com/guides/identity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;look up a user’s PDS from their handle&lt;/a&gt;, instead of asking them for their PDS address via user input. I haven’t quite worked out how to demonstrate this in simple &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; commands, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atproto.com/sdks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;official SDKs&lt;/a&gt; can deal with this if you want to skip ahead to inspecting those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-wait!-theres-oauth!&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/next-steps-with-bluesky-hosting-your-own-data-and-more-on-the-api/#but-wait!-theres-oauth!&quot;&gt;But wait! There’s OAuth!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAuth support has been recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://atproto.com/specs/oauth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;added to the ATproto specification&lt;/a&gt;. It’s so new I haven’t had a chance to dive in and figure out how it works from a practical, developer, point of view. If you’re more used to OAuth through integrating with more established services like GitHub or Twitter, this might be the better authentication method for your app than the app-password flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t give you any of my own examples here, but I can point you to useful resources I’ve found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/oauth-client&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Official OAuth implementation guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atproto.com/guides/applications&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Official “building apps” quick-start&lt;/a&gt; - uses OAuth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pilcrowonpaper/atproto-oauth-example&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pilcrowonpaper/atproto-oauth-example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zeucapua/myb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;zeucapua/myb&lt;/a&gt; - custom web client that implements OAuth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which in some circles we’re now calling “the ATmosphere”. Apparently. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/next-steps-with-bluesky-hosting-your-own-data-and-more-on-the-api/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big sticking point, IMHO, is the identifier directory. I compare it to ICAAN above, others compare it to the root DNS servers. Either way, while the main way of looking up entities in the Atproto network is controlled by a VC-funded corporation the network isn’t fully “open”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://alice.bsky.sh/post/3laega7icmi2q&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;You can mirror the directory&lt;/a&gt;, but if noone else is aware of the mirrors it feels largely pointless as anything other than a “maybe, just in case” backup exercise. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/next-steps-with-bluesky-hosting-your-own-data-and-more-on-the-api/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Positive (but Unsatisfactory) Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/positive-but-unsatisfactory-resolutions/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/well-fck/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Yesterday was stressful&lt;/a&gt;, not going to lie. I had a lot of questions about how I’d found myself in the predicament. I was being chased for a debt that wasn’t mine, where I was specifically told someone had talked to a debt agency, given my details, and “passed security validation” with them. It was now on me to prove I wasn’t related to the debt in question. As the facts I’d been given and questions started to roll around me head, it seemed more and more likely I was the victim of identity theft/fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first thing this morning - after sending off the “proof” the debt agency had requested - I phoned up Police Scotland’s 101 phone line. The person I spoke to was lovely, and understanding, as I explained the situation and what I’d been told, gave me an incident reference, and scheduled a time for a dedicated officer to give me a call later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then shot off another email to the debt agency, to give them the incident reference and explain I was treating this as the person who had run up the debt was committing identity theft and/or fraud and was involving the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader, you’ll never believe what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of hours later, I received a call from a manager at the debt agency. Still referring to “my” debt, I might add, and asking what the problem was that had seen the case passed to them. They start to take me through the “standard” verification - name, address, date of birth… only, lo and behold, my date of birth doesn’t match their file. They confirm it with me twice, just to be sure. Then they check some other details and when I explain the only reason they have those details was because I contacted them for the first time ever yesterday, they started removing them from the file. As they did, it became more and more clear to the person on the other end of the phone that I was not who they were looking for. You don’t say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So how did two of your colleagues ‘pass’ me through verification yesterday?” I asked. I got an unclear answer about how “sometimes the tracing software merges records that are similar enough to each other”. I’ve been in the presence of too many people and organisations who have messed up that I can tell when someone is trying to avoid any accountability, and this sounded like that. But I didn’t really get the chance to get myself straight and grill them on the details. They were trying to get rid of me, quickly. I was told my details had been removed from their files, I wasn’t responsible for the debt, and they wouldn’t be contacting me again. If something similar ever does happen again I’ve to tell whichever agency calls that it’s a “tracing error, and it’s happened before”. And with that, the call ended and I was set free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only, I still have loads and loads of questions about what happened, and why it was allowed to happen. Was there no verification step to check “merged records”? Was noone I spoke to yesterday paying even the slightest bit of attention to the inconsistencies in their data and what I was telling them? Or was I being dismissed and ingnored in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMig9fTx6Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Shawshank-esque “Everybody is innocent in here”&lt;/a&gt; manner? How would this have turned out if I didn’t have the privileges I have and wasn’t able to fight my corner? More questions spawn everytime I go over events. It’s quite maddening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s seemingly over, and I don’t have to worry about this mess any more. It’s a positive outcome, but all the unanswered questions make it deeply unsatisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most annoying parts of the saga is I’ve (almost certainly) tracked down the person they actually want to find. It took me a couple of the details they gave me on the phone yesterday, and less than 10 minutes in DuckDuckGo. The fact it was this easy without their extended toolset just adds to the frustration!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Well, F*ck</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/well-fck/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Picture the scene, Dear Reader; it’s just after 10am, and you take a moment to open the just-delivered mail over the remains of your morning coffee. Among the deliveries of small paint pots for your latest hobby project, is a non-descript envelope marked “private and confidential” but not bearing the usual hallmarks of being from your bank. Intrigued, you open it up, and nearly spit your coffee across the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside is a letter. From a debt collection agency you’ve never heard of, on behalf of another company you’ve never heard of. It’s relating to a debt amount you don’t recognise, and says you’ve defaulted on a repayment schedule you know nothing about. You must contact them within 7 days of the date of the letter - which is dated 10 days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially you think “oh ho, it must be some sort of sophisticated, quaintly offline, scam?” But some quick research reveals all the companies involved are legitimate and as serious as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/life-is-a-lemon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;brain haemorrhage&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling faintly nauseated, you pick up the phone and call the number in the letter…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds pretty nightmare-ish, doesn’t it? Welcome to my morning. Well, day, actually. This post is largely so I can get my thoughts straight about everything. I don’t have all the details yet, but from what I’ve been able to tease out of the debt collection agency&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/well-fck/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, this is what appears to be the facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company A&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/well-fck/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; bought a debt from a utilities company, and handed it to the debt collection agency (hereon: Company B) to manage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This debt is from 2020, and relates to a property in a town I’ve never visited, let alone lived in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person 1 relating to this debt/property is somehow contacted by Company B - I’m guessing by post?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person 1 is prompted to call Company B and “passes security validation” by giving my details. I’ve asked Company B what this entails. If it’s the standard questions above then it feels woefull inadequate given how much of it is easily available online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person 1 sets up a repayment plan, makes 2 manual payments of £10, then defaults on the first regular £20 payment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company B has an email address (not mine), and no other way of contacting Person 1 - no phone number or alternative address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company B sends notice of default to the name and address they have - mine - which leads us to today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-in-all, it’s been a pretty stressful day, and I don’t know how long this is going to rumble on for, either. It appears that the onus is entirely on me to prove that I have nothing to do with the property or debt in question. So far I’ve been asked to provide a council tax bill, but that seems flimsy (i.e. easily rejectable) proof at best, and it’s up to Company A whether they accept it or not. It’s almost the old “how do you prove a negative” conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: fuck, fuck, fuckity-fuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who were at least willing to listen to me, even if I got the feeling they either don’t believe me, or simply don’t care they may have it wrong. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/well-fck/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company A are pretty infamous for this sort of thing, as far as I can tell. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/well-fck/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Home Screen for iOS 18 Beta</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/new-home-screen-for-ios-18-beta/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing around with the new ios 18 beta, now it’s available to the public. While I have found it a pretty dull update so far, I particularly wanted to try some some of the new customisation options. I haven’t found a colourful tint that works for me, but I am loving this kinda Brutalist black-and-white scheme I stumbled into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper grid mt-l-xl&quot; role=&quot;list&quot; data-rows=&quot;masonry&quot; data-layout=&quot;50-50&quot; style=&quot;--grid-min-item-size: clamp(16rem, 50vw, 20rem)&quot;&gt;

      <title>Adding the New Mastodon Link Attribution Meta Tag</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/adding-the-new-mastodon-link-attribution-meta-tag/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just added&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/adding-the-new-mastodon-link-attribution-meta-tag/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/07/highlighting-journalism-on-mastodon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;new Mastodon/Fediverse link attribution meta tag&lt;/a&gt; to this site, partly because I think it’s a neat idea, but also because it took ~2 minutes to do and I’m all for quick wins at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the tag is straightforward, if you’re familiar with HTML. Put the following in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; section of your web page HTML, replacing the value of &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; with your @-able profile name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;fediverse:creator&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;@yourprofile@yourmastodon.server&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So mine would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;fediverse:creator&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;@chrisplusplus@social.lol&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people can stop there. Because I wanted to pull the value from a config file and output it in my Eleventy templates, I had &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; more work to do. Just in case I switch instances again. I changed my &lt;code&gt;_data/meta.js&lt;/code&gt; to include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;meta_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// other stuff removed for clarity...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;fediverseCreator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;@chrisplusplus@social.lol&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And added the following to my &lt;code&gt;meta-info.njk&lt;/code&gt; template partial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-plaintext&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext&quot;&gt;
{% if meta.meta_data.fediverseCreator %}
&amp;lt;meta name=&quot;fediverse:creator&quot; content=&quot;{{ meta.meta_data.fediverseCreator }}&quot; /&gt;
{% endif %}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was it. Done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, I added the tag a while back, but I needed to update the value once it was “official” because an earlier example excluded the leading &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; from the profile name, so I had to add that in. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/adding-the-new-mastodon-link-attribution-meta-tag/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>Dragonriding in Jade Forest</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/dragonriding-in-jade-forest/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in the last post I was really enjoying dragonriding in the Pandaria: Remix event that’s going on in World of Warcraft right now. I took a break from the game for a couple of years, so this is my first time trying the new “dynamic flying”, and it is by far my favourite feature added to the game. I can easily loose 10-15 minutes at a time just swooping around the zones, and right now, Jade Forest is my favourite due to the size and verticality. I’ve yet to play Dragonflight itself - the expansion that was built for dragonriding and gave us the feature - but I figure I’ve got a couple of months to get around to it…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, here’s a capture I made of a couple of loops around the forest:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;youtube-embed&quot;&gt; &lt;lite-youtube videoid=&quot;72NuXapPDn0&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(&#39;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72NuXapPDn0/hqdefault.jpg&#39;);&quot;&gt;
  &lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;lty-playbtn&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;lyt-visually-hidden&quot;&gt;Dragonriding and Chill: Jade Forest&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/lite-youtube&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Early Riser</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/early-riser/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was planning to write a blog post about getting up early in the near future, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnydecimal.com/22.00.0058/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Johnny Decimal went and beat me to it&lt;/a&gt;, so that spurred me to write it sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last four months or so we’ve made a point of waking up at 5am. Prior to that I’d found myself getting up later and later. Some days I was essentially going straight from bed to desk (by way of the shower), having breakfast as I read through morning emails. It wasn’t good or sustainable. The drift started during the lockdown phase of the pandemic; initially I’d kept to my 6:10am “going to the office” routine, but eventually it started to give way to the stress of the situation. 5 minutes here, 20 there… before I knew it I effectively had no alarm or routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember what spurred the idea to enforce this new 5am alarm. We did it for a week last year, as my partner wanted to film &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEwS1T6xtmo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a video for her YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, but it didn’t become a habit. I think I remembered us both feeling good about it at the time and thought it might be an antidote to how rubbish I was feeling about my current lack of routine. I once joked with my partner that my 2 underlying motivators are smugness and spite - and getting up early feels like it falls into the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we are, after the dust has had a chance to settle. How has it been? Honestly, &lt;em&gt;pretty good&lt;/em&gt;. Some mornings are a struggle still, and a couple of times I’ve slapped my alarm off at 5am, then looked at my watch a moment later and it’s 6:30… but &lt;strong&gt;getting out of bed at 5&lt;/strong&gt; is not a hard and fast rule (yet?). The goal is to have more time before work, and I’m still achieving that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do I do with this “extra” time? Mostly it’s a mental health “firebreak”; dedicated time before work to de-stress and otherwise get into a good place mentally. Unlike Johnny, I &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; start work any earlier. I’ve done the “start hours before the rest of the team thing so I can get work done” thing in the past, and it worked wonderfully when I was in an office, but I found it hasn’t worked so well when working from home. Your mileage may vary, of course. If I do want to do anything productive, I catch up on things like laundry, dishes, or other household tasks I’ve invariably been putting off. Lately I’ve even taken to playing 45-60 minutes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24092672/updated-225-world-of-warcraft-remix-mists-of-pandaria-now-live&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;World of Warcraft (Pandaria Remix)&lt;/a&gt; before work. Not so much a “productive” thing but it’s meant I’m starting the work day in a good mood. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/72NuXapPDn0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dragon Riding around Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; is such a great way to unwind.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brunch at The Craftsman</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/brunch-at-the-craftsman/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecraftsmancompany.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Craftsman is a Coffee and Alehouse in Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;. Wanting to visit somewhere outwith the quarter of the city we normally stick to, it’s located just next to the harbour, and in my youth used to be the Schooner Bar - famed for its 7am opening times and being one of the roughest pubs in Aberdeen. Times have changed though, and The Craftsman is much more welcoming and modern. It was much more lively than &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/brunch-at-second-home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Second Home&lt;/a&gt;, in part due to the location near the travel hubs and major shopping centre, and also because it’s been around longer is better established. The music was eclectic, seemingly jumping around eras and genres. It had that slightly hipster-ish feeling I get with a lot of the new places springing up around Aberdeen. Not in a pretentious way, more in the “hand-crafted” vibe and use of reclaimed/recycled fixtures and fittings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a coffee and pancakes with bacon and maple syrup again. I’m trying to establish a baseline to compare places against, you see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food, and drinks, were all pretty good. Again, I think it’s somewhere we’ll try to revisit - even if it is a little out of our way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Post Restoration Project - Dealing with WordPress Post-Kinds Data</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/post-restoration-project-dealing-with-wordpress-post-kinds-data/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/new-year-old-posts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;I restored a lot of old posts&lt;/a&gt; to this site from a WordPress backup. While this worked great for posts that had “standard” content, I was missing hundreds of posts and even more metadata that relied on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/Post_Kinds_Plugin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt; Post-Kinds &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;plugin for WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. In the export file this plugin data is largely stored as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.serialize.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;serialised PHP data&lt;/a&gt; structures within the XML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown/tree/master&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The tool I used&lt;/a&gt; to convert the export didn’t know how to handle this data, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mcleodchris/wordpress-mf2-to-markdown&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;I’ve started a project to build a tool which can&lt;/a&gt;. It’s in &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; early stages (literally just a couple of files that aren’t joined up yet), but I think I’ve got one of the harder parts done - a utility function to parse the serialised PHP data into a usable JavaScript object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.chrismcleod.dev/chrismcleod.dev/assets/resized/de777bd1-48de-45c6-97b2-c1c4fded82e9-320.avif 320w, https://assets.chrismcleod.dev/chrismcleod.dev/assets/resized/de777bd1-48de-45c6-97b2-c1c4fded82e9-570.avif 570w, https://assets.chrismcleod.dev/chrismcleod.dev/assets/resized/de777bd1-48de-45c6-97b2-c1c4fded82e9-820.avif 820w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 55rem) 820px, 100vw&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.chrismcleod.dev/chrismcleod.dev/assets/resized/de777bd1-48de-45c6-97b2-c1c4fded82e9-320.webp 320w, https://assets.chrismcleod.dev/chrismcleod.dev/assets/resized/de777bd1-48de-45c6-97b2-c1c4fded82e9-570.webp 570w, https://assets.chrismcleod.dev/chrismcleod.dev/assets/resized/de777bd1-48de-45c6-97b2-c1c4fded82e9-820.webp 820w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 55rem) 820px, 100vw&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.chrismcleod.dev/chrismcleod.dev/assets/resized/de777bd1-48de-45c6-97b2-c1c4fded82e9-320.jpeg 320w, https://assets.chrismcleod.dev/chrismcleod.dev/assets/resized/de777bd1-48de-45c6-97b2-c1c4fded82e9-570.jpeg 570w, https://assets.chrismcleod.dev/chrismcleod.dev/assets/resized/de777bd1-48de-45c6-97b2-c1c4fded82e9-820.jpeg 820w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 55rem) 820px, 100vw&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/post-restoration-project-dealing-with-wordpress-post-kinds-data/undefined&quot; width=&quot;820&quot; height=&quot;undefined&quot; alt=&quot;a screenshot of a code editor with a dark theme. It displays JavaScript code for a test suite using the Mocha framework. The test is named “unserialie objects using sample data,” and it includes input data which is a string of serialised PHP data, and the expected output which is a JavaScript object. Test coverage for the file is shown as 97.7%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot still to do, and it’s going to take me a while to get there, but I’m one step closer to restoring the missing posts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brunch at Second Home</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.secondhomeaberdeen.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Second Home is a newly-opened café + studio in Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;. My partner visited while &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/soaring/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;I was in London&lt;/a&gt;, and was raving about the brownie she’d had ever since, so we decided to make a date of it and go for brunch at the weekend. The food and drink were great, and the atmosphere was very relaxed and spacious. I can see us becoming semi-regular visitors!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating a Remote Dev Machine with Raspberry Pi and VS Code</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/creating-a-remote-dev-machine-with-raspberry-pi-and-vs-code/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came into possession of a Raspberry Pi 5B, and was trying to figure out what to do with it. I came across this article by Jim Bennett on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/coding-on-raspberry-pi-remotely-with-visual-studio-code/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;setting up a headless Raspberry Pi 4 as a headless development machine&lt;/a&gt;, and it got the cogs turning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My “development environment” on my personal laptop is a bit of a mess; I have been doing a lot of certifications and other learning over the last couple of years, so I have installed a lot of random tools and cloned a lot of repositories. With this much churn, stuff breaks all the time. I had to move my blog’s development environment into a Devcontainer because one day it just stopped building locally. So I had a thought - why not keep the laptop for learning (and writing), but move all of my actual projects onto a dedicated machine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need such a machine to be particularly powerful - fast storage and networking that lets it be accessible from anywhere, and enough horsepower to run VS Code plus the occasional container. Ideally quiet. That’s where the Pi comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set things up as I did, you will need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Raspberry Pi 5B + a means of powering it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pimoroni NVMe Base + suitable NVMe SSD (I have 512GB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MicroSD card for the initial OS install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft or GitHub account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps below assume you have assembled all of the hardware according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-nvme-base&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-setup-your-microsd-card-with-raspberry-pi-imager&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/creating-a-remote-dev-machine-with-raspberry-pi-and-vs-code/#step-1-setup-your-microsd-card-with-raspberry-pi-imager&quot;&gt;Step 1: Setup your MicroSD card with Raspberry Pi Imager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi Imager&lt;/a&gt; is the easiest way to get started. It will create a bootable installation of Raspberry Pi OS (a variant of Debian) on the MicroSD card. You can even pre-configure it with Wi-Fi details, username, password + an SSH key. I highly recommend you set these up before booting your Pi, as it means you never have to plug any peripherals into the Pi to get everything else setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-boot-the-pi-and-do-initial-prep&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/creating-a-remote-dev-machine-with-raspberry-pi-and-vs-code/#step-2-boot-the-pi-and-do-initial-prep&quot;&gt;Step 2: Boot the Pi and do initial prep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put your preconfigured MicroSD into the slot on the Pi, and power it on. The Pi might restart once or twice, but it should be ready to go in about 30-45 seconds. Open a terminal and connect to it using SSH:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ssh&lt;/span&gt; chris@raspberrypi.local&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you setup a SSH key then you’ll probably need to enter the passphrase, otherwise it will prompt you for the account password. Once logged in, run an initial system update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; update
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; upgrade &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re at it, we’ll check our NVMe SSD is connected correctly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt; /dev/nvme0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this repeats the name of the device back to you, then it’s all good. If not, re-check everything is connected together properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;optional-install-configure-raspberry-pi-connect&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/creating-a-remote-dev-machine-with-raspberry-pi-and-vs-code/#optional-install-configure-raspberry-pi-connect&quot;&gt;Optional: Install + Configure Raspberry Pi Connect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/connect.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi Connect&lt;/a&gt; is an in-beta service that lets you connect to the Pi’s desktop from any web browser. I set it up as a fallback, as I didn’t know if I might later need to access the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/id.html#create-a-raspberry-pi-id&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Create a Raspberry Pi ID&lt;/a&gt;, then proceed with the installation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; rpi-connect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When installation is finished, reboot with &lt;code&gt;sudo reboot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the Pi is back online, connect it to your Raspberry Pi ID:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;rpi-connect signin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will prompt you to visit a URL in a web browser and sign in to your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once completed you can access your Pi desktop from &lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.raspberrypi.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://connect.raspberrypi.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-transfer-the-installation-to-the-ssd&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/creating-a-remote-dev-machine-with-raspberry-pi-and-vs-code/#step-3-transfer-the-installation-to-the-ssd&quot;&gt;Step 3: Transfer the installation to the SSD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could, &lt;em&gt;in theory&lt;/em&gt; continue to boot from the MicroSD card, and just set the SSD as storage. This would work, but the overall performance will be much slower, in my experience. It’s better to move everything over to the SSD and boot from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also setup the SSD fresh using Raspberry Pi Imager on the Pi, but you’d have to repeat all of the previous setup steps again. So I think it’s better to transfer (or, more accurately, clone) the MicroSD instead. It’s super quick and painless. You can do this in one of 2 ways: use the SD Card Copier software from the Pi desktop, or run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/dev/mmcblk0 &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/dev/nvme0n1 &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the SD Card Copier, simply because I still had the Raspberry Pi Connect session open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure, &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-nvme-base#os-installation-options&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;check this section of the instructions&lt;/a&gt; for the NVMe Base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the copy is complete, &lt;strong&gt;remove the MicroSD card&lt;/strong&gt; and reboot again. You should find your Pi is accessible in less than half the time it previously was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-prepare-remote-tunnelling&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/creating-a-remote-dev-machine-with-raspberry-pi-and-vs-code/#step-4-prepare-remote-tunnelling&quot;&gt;Step 4: Prepare Remote Tunnelling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSH back onto your Pi. Install Visual Studio Code&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/creating-a-remote-dev-machine-with-raspberry-pi-and-vs-code/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; code&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once done, start a tunnel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;code tunnel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to accept some terms and login to either a Microsoft or GitHub account by following the prompts on-screen. If you leave everything as-is, you will now have a tunnel named “raspberrypi”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5-connect-visual-studio-code&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/creating-a-remote-dev-machine-with-raspberry-pi-and-vs-code/#step-5-connect-visual-studio-code&quot;&gt;Step 5:  Connect Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your regular computer (not the Pi), open VS Code. Install the&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-server&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; Remote - Tunnels extension&lt;/a&gt;. Once installed, open the Command Palette (&lt;code&gt;F1&lt;/code&gt;) and type &lt;code&gt;Remote Tunnel&lt;/code&gt;. You should see an option to connect. Select this option. You might be asked to authorise the connection using GitHub or Microsoft - use whichever you picked in the previous step, and login if required. Once authorised you should see a list of your available tunnels, which should include your new “raspberrypi” tunnel. Select the tunnel and let VS Code connect (it shouldn’t take long).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, you can do everything you normally would in VS Code - open folders/workspaces, start a terminal, and work on files as you would on your local computer. You can even install extensions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a computer without VS Code natively installed you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://vscode.dev/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://vscode.dev/&lt;/a&gt; instead - you’ll just need to authorise the connection with the same account as earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get stuck at any point, &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;refer to the Remote Tunnels documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;optional-recommended-set-the-remote-tunnel-to-connect-whenever-the-pi-restarts&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/creating-a-remote-dev-machine-with-raspberry-pi-and-vs-code/#optional-recommended-set-the-remote-tunnel-to-connect-whenever-the-pi-restarts&quot;&gt;Optional (recommended): Set the Remote Tunnel to connect whenever the Pi restarts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, the Remote Tunnel won’t be available when the Pi restarts, or you close the SSH connection you started it from. To fix this, you need to set it up in service mode. If you’re still connected to the Pi, and the tunnel is currently running, press &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + C&lt;/code&gt; to stop the process (this will disconnect any remote sessions). Run the following command to start the tunnel as a service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;code tunnel &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-ssh&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/creating-a-remote-dev-machine-with-raspberry-pi-and-vs-code/#what-about-ssh&quot;&gt;What about SSH?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide used Remote Tunnels, but you can easily swap to using SSH for remote connections. &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Just use the Remote - SSH extension instead&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll need to use the same login method as you would a regular SSH connection though - so if your Raspberry Pi is setup to only allow SSH keys, you’ll need to copy your private key to every machine you want to connect from. Personally, I didn’t want to do that from e.g. my work laptop, so that’s why I’m using Tunnels instead, but use whatever works best for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can install &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels#_using-the-code-cli&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;just the CLI component&lt;/a&gt; if you want, but I installed the full client in case I ever want to edit files directly on the Pi &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/creating-a-remote-dev-machine-with-raspberry-pi-and-vs-code/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Soaring</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/soaring/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got on a plane for the first time in about 6 years this week, and about 11 years since my first solo trip. Not a huge amount has changed; the local airport is slightly nicer, and its security is less burdensome, but it’s still akin to cramming into an aluminium tube and taking a hopeful running jump into the skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing has changed since my last flight: I am quite a bit larger nowadays. There’s not much I could do about that in the short time I had between finding out I had to make the trip to boarding the plane. It just made the experience of travelling less comfortable, and was one more reminder I need to find a way to get back in shape. But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this trip was a celebration. The outcome of my most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/appraisal/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;performance review&lt;/a&gt; was the highest possible grade. As a “thank you for your hard work”, the business unit leader likes to gather everyone who achieves this grade for a nice meal and overnight stay. For logistical reasons there are three such events held this year, at various places around the country, and I attended the first one which was in London. So down I went on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love London. I could never live there, because it’s utterly insane, but I love to visit and see the wonder and greatness of it that seems to be lost on the locals and anyone who visits regularly. The transportation network and related infrastructure is a particular joy to my nerdy brain. On this visit the network seemed even better than my previous visits, as the Elizabeth Line and other upgrades were finally finished. It was positively marvellous to experience how connected and easy everything was as far as getting from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only part that let me down was when I had to go on foot; Apple Maps is pretty accurate and reliable for my small city with a singular internal public transport mode (bus), but using it in London was a nightmare. I was trying to find some coffee places in walking distance of Liverpool Street Station to meet my team at on the following day, and then make my way to the hotel. It sent me this way and that for around forty minutes, never taking the most direct route. By the end I was hot, frustrated, and only found two of the places suggested on the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those venues was too small to host us, but did give me the best &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ZdQPZEpbOFk?si=nrIVWwgdCPLOT9M-&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cortado&lt;/a&gt; I’d ever had. My experiment in asking for the addition of a pinch of brown sugar was possibly my best choice all day. Anyway: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/PickwickCoffee/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pickwick Coffee Club&lt;/a&gt; next to Liverpool Street Underground Station - best coffee shop coffee I’ve had in a long time, possibly ever. I instantly felt much better after drinking it. Definitely recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Maps cocked up again when trying to route me from Liverpool Street Station to the hotel, which was in Shoreditch. Instead of sensibly telling me to get off at Cambridge Heath and walking less than ten minutes in a straight line, it had me getting off the Overground at Bethnal Green and took me in a long, meandering route in mostly the opposite direction through Tower Hamlets and a housing estate. At one point I received a sympathetic nod from a young man who could tell I was clearly lost and out of place. I did eventually reach the hotel, but by this point I was in dire need of a shower and change of clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, the hotel was very nice. The room was comfortable, with the “quirky” addition of Loony Tunes masks hanging from the lights and some jazzy and subversive styling touches if you were paying close attention. The décor throughout was suitably trendy and off beat. I’d go back, if I ever felt “cool” enough. The food was divine, both for the evening meal with colleagues and morning breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the main reason I was in London, both social events were a joy. The meal was mostly people I didn’t know, though some I’d met (online) through various projects or initiatives I was involved with. Between courses we had to take turns introducing ourselves by name, role, and one or more interesting facts about ourselves or hobbies. I spent some time thinking about this over the main course and managed to come up with a veritable smorgasbord of minor facts, most of which I’d forgotten about. I’m going to add them to a new About page whenever I get around to putting that live. At the end of the meal we each received a nice, substantial, glass trophy as a permanent reminder of our achievement, which was a nice touch to top things off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team meetup was more of an opportunistic thing than the meal. I’ve worked with most of the people who were there for four years, and I’d not had a realistic opportunity to meet in person during that time. When it costs £300-450 for flights + hotel for me to travel, it puts it out of budget for most team events, when it’s £30 per head available for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t get into the venue I’d looked at the day before, but found another in Broadgate Circle. It was more of a bar than coffee shop, but we made do. The sun shining helped, I think. The original plan was for everyone to get coffee, but I ended up having a soft drink to cool down a bit instead. Plus I was still thinking about that Cortado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about an hour and a half of chit chat and time away from work, I needed to leave to catch my flight home. I won’t recount the experience of Heathrow Terminal 5 here, as it would end things on a sour note. I felt refreshed after the team meetup, which is odd as I’m firmly an introvert, and gatherings drain me. I guess it was the rarity of the event made it so special. I’m hoping I can wrangle a trip back sooner than the four years it’s taken to have this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows, maybe I’ll get the top grade again and will have another meal to attend in a year’s time. It’s coming up for “review season” again so I better start putting my evidence together!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Things I Find Github Copilot Actually Useful For</title>
      <link>https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/things-i-find-github-copilot-actually-useful-for/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been lightly using Github Copilot in a personal capacity for almost a year, and I’m probably going to get to use it on work projects in the near future. I thought I’d take a moment to collect my thoughts on where I’ve found any value in using it, as well as acknowledge some of the shortcomings I’ve experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-existing-code&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/things-i-find-github-copilot-actually-useful-for/#understanding-existing-code&quot;&gt;Understanding Existing Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work with a lot of code that was either written a long time ago, or I need to work with only infrequently. Sometimes both at the same time. I’ll need to figure out what that code does before I can make any changes, and that can take a while if I’m doing it “manually” - often it won’t be until I run the code through the unit tests or a debugging session, or sometimes “as a user”, until it really clicks. Copilot has made this a lot faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting a bit of code, opening the chat interface, and asking it “what does this do?” and getting a very clear and concise breakdown, has been genuinely revolutionary to my workflows. I don’t need to scratch my head for hours at a time. I don’t need to sketch out flow diagrams or step-by-steps on a piece of paper to map things out. I ask Copilot, it churns away for a moment, then it gives me the answer in clear steps, highlighting particularly important variables and function calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One side-effect I’ve noticed of asking Copilot to explain something is it will sometimes highlight potential bugs as part of the explanation, which can make resolving issues quicker. You can explicitly ask it to find and fix issues instead, but mentioning them in an explanation is useful context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can already see how I might make use of this in story analysis, and discussions around extending or improving legacy systems, even just in regular day to day work like code reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;documenting-existing-code&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/things-i-find-github-copilot-actually-useful-for/#documenting-existing-code&quot;&gt;Documenting Existing Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a little more hit-or-miss than providing mere explanation, but Copilot has been pretty good at generating documentation of code. By documentation I mean useful inline comments and the use of JSDoc or other, language-specific, syntax used to aid in autocompletion and the generation of API documentation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to find that asking Copilot to document an entire file at once will make it choke, so going function-by function works better. Some nuance in, say, type definitions might get glossed over, but if it saves me typing out 80-90% of the details then I think it’s a win in this particular task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a use-case for this very feature at work right now, and I’m sure I’ll refine and improve my use of it over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;improving-code&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/things-i-find-github-copilot-actually-useful-for/#improving-code&quot;&gt;Improving Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m distinguishing “improving code” from “writing code” here, as I personally think Copilot is better at the former than it is at the latter. Everyone thinks of Copilot generating &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; code for us, and much of the criticism of it I’ve seen has generally been along the lines of “the code isn’t very good/is completely wrong”… and honestly, I get it. Sometimes Copilot is &lt;em&gt;scary&lt;/em&gt; prescient and suggests the exact code I want before I’ve finished considering what to write, but often I find it’s quite wide of the mark&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/things-i-find-github-copilot-actually-useful-for/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But give it some existing code and ask it to improve (or as I usually ask: “simplify”) and in my experience it is much more likely to do the job right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This even extends to code you might have just generated with Copilot. It might only be my experience, but for anything more than an obvious one/two-liner, often the first (acceptable) code Copilot will give me is correct but verbose, sometimes needlessly so. By selecting the code and asking for a simplification, &lt;em&gt;most of the time&lt;/em&gt; you will get a much better version of what was originally there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve found myself doing this quite a bit lately, as I refactor a personal project I wrote over fifteen years ago, and I’ve been pretty happy with the results. I’m sure mid-20’s me was very smart and knew exactly what he was doing at the time, but me of the present is looking at a lot of his code and thinking “it doesn’t need to be this complicated”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-productive-in-unfamiliar-languages/frameworks&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/things-i-find-github-copilot-actually-useful-for/#being-productive-in-unfamiliar-languages/frameworks&quot;&gt;Being Productive in Unfamiliar Languages/Frameworks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jump around between stacks a lot, and often I’ll need to work on something that’s similar to a thing I did before, but in a new language or framework. I’m sure you know the drill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining my existing knowledge and experience with Copilot’s explanations, suggestions, and iterating over the code, I’m able to be productive faster on something new than if I was picking it up from scratch on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this initial output equivalent to that of someone experienced in the language/framework? No, of course not. But it moves me closer, faster, and with the right support allows me to jump into new scenarios with less trepidation. I don’t necessarily need to do a course or binge a bunch of related YouTube videos to get up to speed on something &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; starting work on it - now I can likely get started first and augment that initial productivity with learning materials. As someone who learns better by doing, this reduces the friction somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-ive-struggled-with-copilot&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/things-i-find-github-copilot-actually-useful-for/#where-ive-struggled-with-copilot&quot;&gt;Where I’ve Struggled with Copilot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned a couple of things above where I’ve found Copilot less magical than the marketing would suggest, but for posterity, here are some additional areas where I’ve found Copilot lacking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;unit-tests&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/things-i-find-github-copilot-actually-useful-for/#unit-tests&quot;&gt;Unit Tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there was one thing I &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; wanted Copilot to be able to do for me, it was this - generate unit tests for my code. I am generally not quick at writing tests on my own, so it becomes a bit of a bottleneck. I’ve seen loads of people be able to generate whole test suites using Copilot, but I’ve just never managed to get it to work. Maybe it’s bad luck, maybe it’s how I’ve written the code to be tested, I’m not sure. The recurring problem seems to be it hallucinating things that aren’t in the code it’s meant to be testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;inline-chat-seems-less-accurate-than-the-main-chat-window-somehow&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/things-i-find-github-copilot-actually-useful-for/#inline-chat-seems-less-accurate-than-the-main-chat-window-somehow&quot;&gt;Inline Chat seems less accurate than the main Chat Window somehow?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one confuses me. If I use &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;I&lt;/kbd&gt; to bring up the inline chat, and ask it to suggest some code/explain/whatever, the resulting suggestion is wrong considerably more often than if I use the main chat window (&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Alt&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;I&lt;/kbd&gt;). This might be down to how I’m using inline chat, given the importance for context in getting accurate answers, but it’s been a frustration for a while. Perhaps I need to dedicate some time to figure out what I’m doing wrong, as there’s no reason I should be seeing such wildly different success rates between the two interfaces!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;summing-up&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/things-i-find-github-copilot-actually-useful-for/#summing-up&quot;&gt;Summing Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I find Copilot genuinely helpful for several things: understanding, documenting, and refactoring existing code, as well as jumpstarting work in new languages/frameworks. That these tend to be some of the most common or important things I do on a daily basis means Copilot does earn a place in my toolbox. Outside of these things though, I find it less useful, and certainly nowhere near living up to the marketing hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an ongoing issue where Copilot will suddenly, and without prompting, suggest large blocks of code that are essentially a copy-and-paste of something I’ve just written, or appears later in the file. Either way, it’s almost never relevant. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/things-i-find-github-copilot-actually-useful-for/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
