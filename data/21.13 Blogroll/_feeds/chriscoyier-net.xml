<p>Just in case I haven&#8217;t made my feelings clear lately on the current United States of America administration, I shall blog. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s the little things that make me think Donald Trump is a vindictive prick who, among his catalog of things he hates, is Black people. </p>



<p>For instance, he&#8217;s chosen to change what days are &#8220;free entrance days&#8221; at our National Parks. Here&#8217;s a screenshot of the difference between <a href="https://arc.net/l/quote/yfourdoj">2025</a> and <a href="https://arc.net/l/quote/mwghynsr">2026</a>:</p>

<p>In short: Remove MLK Day, remove Juneteenth, add&#8230; birthdays. He added his own birthday to the list. </p>



<p>Is it the biggest deal in the world? No. Is it maybe actually nice that there are now <em>more</em> days that are free entrance days? Yes. Does it <em>feel like </em>the decision making process was <em>&#8220;get that black crap off of there and put my birthday on!&#8221;</em>? Yes, in the same vein he likes to put his own name on <a href="https://theweek.com/politics/list-everything-trump-named-himself">everything</a>. Does it matter what it feels like to the people of this country? Yes. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I know I&#8217;ve mentioned a ton of times: while I enjoy playing videos games <em>sometimes</em>,<em> a little, </em>I enjoy watching other people play them <em>more</em>. Even as a little kid. Like an awesome play date would be going over to a friends to watch them play. Perfect world, the friend would <em>only </em>play when I was watching, so I could see everything. Even more perfect, I could sidekick, referencing maps, looking up tips, keeping track of things, etc. </p>



<p>I honestly thought I was just weird for a lot of my life. It was literally an <em>oh cool I&#8217;m not weird at all</em> moment when Amazon bought Twitch for $970 million in 2014, a platform for literally watching people play video games. It was like a mini version of learning that <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2013/04/08/introversion/">being introverted isn&#8217;t weird</a>.</p>



<p>For better or worse, I don&#8217;t have a lot of space in my life right now now to sit on a couch with friends watching them play video games. Probably better, honestly. I think my freetime is better suited for things that fullfill me in a little deeper way like music stuff and going for a dang hike. </p>



<p>But now&#8217;a&#8217;days, naturally: YouTube. </p>



<p>I can watch people play videogames on YouTube (I do actually like Twitch too, but only when the &#8220;live&#8221; aspect is additive, which isn&#8217;t usually). </p>



<p>But you know what I don&#8217;t do? Hear about some new game that seems cool, and just go right to YouTube to check it out by watching a &#8220;playthrough&#8221;.</p>



<p>What do I actually do? I buy the game, play it for a while, enjoy it, but ultimately give up, <em>then</em> I go to YouTube. That&#8217;s what I mean by <strong>the breakaway moment</strong>. </p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t some moral high-ground where I soapbox about how gaming studios are losing money because people aren&#8217;t buying the game they are just watching it &#8220;for free&#8221; and my buying of the game is my way of feeling good about that. I think that&#8217;s an oversimplification and probably not even true. It&#8217;s just&#8230; that&#8217;s how my brain works. </p>



<p>I think I can&#8217;t really get into a YouTube playthrough unless my own brain and fingers have played the real game itself and <em>felt it. </em> Then I can engage with the video somehow much quicker and on a deeper level. </p>



<p>I just did this dance with <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/">Expedition 33: Clair Obscur</a>. I bought it. Well, I was prepared to anyway, but it was included with my XBOX Game Pass. I played it for — I dunno ~7-8 —  hours. But I wasn&#8217;t very good at it. Even though it&#8217;s turn-based combat, there is lots of <em>timing</em> involved and it&#8217;s the kind of thing I grow to resent. Like doing an action and needing to press a button at the exact right moment to enhance it, or an enemy attacking and you needing to dodge or parry at timing <em>that is designed to be tricky</em>. I don&#8217;t get as much satisfaction from getting it right as I get annoyed from missing it. Particularly when, as it turns out, perfectly-timed parries are all but required for winning battles and progressing in the game. It&#8217;s not that I dislike the mechanics, they just aren&#8217;t for me in the sense that <em>most</em> game mechanics aren&#8217;t for me. Maybe I&#8217;m just at a point in my life where I&#8217;m so frustrated by so many things that paying to be artificially frustrated is a no-go. </p>



<p>But: I want to see the mechanics at work, I want to see someone master them, I want to see how the choices and progressions pan out. I <em>really</em> want to see the story unfold. Video game stories can be truly cinematic. So I&#8217;ll just experience them how works best for me. And apparently that&#8217;s trying the game myself, waiting for the breakaway moment, then off to YouTube it is. </p>

<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81167887">The Dig</a> — Archaeology story set in 1939 England, where I found myself much more interested in the mini love stories than anything else. </li>



<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81426931">The Wonder</a> — Florence Pugh absolutely not screwing around playing a nurse in 1862 Ireland sent to witness a &#8220;miracle&#8221; little girl who &#8220;hasn&#8217;t eaten&#8221; in four months.  I worried was going to lose me but gets more compelling as it goes. </li>



<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81092222">The Woman in the Window</a> — Fun murder mystery with Amy Adams with plot twists that all work pretty well. I think in the end there was may one too many people involved leaving it feel a little <em>much</em>.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/82161420">Eden</a> — I thought this island romp with a toothless Jude Law would edge a little closer to horror but it was more thriller. I was into it enough that, even though I didn&#8217;t entirely finish this one on the plane, I put it back on to finish the next morning.</li>

<p>Self publishing rules. I&#8217;ve begun to think that it doesn&#8217;t matter if it &#8220;takes off&#8221;. It&#8217;s where the interesting and smart people are, will continue to be, and I&#8217;ll be here reading it. Thanks the RSS, which matters, despite it&#8217;s uncool status (<a href="https://werd.io/why-rss-matters/">says Ben Werdmuller</a>):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>But to be frank, it’s got terrible PR: it <em>feels</em> like a part of the old web (Google Reader, Web 2.0, Blogger, <em>et al</em>) even though it powers much of the modern one. And standards that enable direct publisher–reader relationships are inconvenient for companies whose business depends on sitting in the middle. Consequently, it’s under threat. The result will be that publishers will lose distribution sovereignty, and readers will lose one of the last tools that puts them, not algorithms, in control.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a time of slow change for me when it comes to the apps I use most regularly.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>🔐 <strong><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> for passwords</strong>, but ideally I&#8217;d like to switch to Apple&#8217;s Passwords/Keychain for most things. Partly because of iOS. When I save a new password on iOS, it&#8217;s always the native Passwords app that offers to save it, not 1Password, and that neuters the usability of 1Password to me. I don&#8217;t like having one foot in both apps, but it feels somewhat inevitable as 1Password is required for work sharing.</li>



<li>👨‍💻 <strong><a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor</a> for large project coding</strong>, but I&#8217;ve bounced around a lot. There are so many VS Code forks with AI integration it&#8217;s been interesting to try them, but I mostly find them all pretty similar. <a href="https://windsurf.com/">Windsurf</a>, <a href="https://www.trae.ai/?ck_subscriber_id=2246502080">Trae</a>, <a href="https://antigravity.google/">Antigravity</a>&#8230; nearly identical. There are also alternative extensions to Copilot in canonical VS Code that are also largely the same. Some have better design polish than others, but the overall UX of Cursor seems the best. I also used Zed for a good month and found it pretty good. And obviously I use <a href="https://codepen.io/your-work">CodePen</a> quite a bit for coding, but not for CodePen itself or other larger-scale projects.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apps/desktop">GitHub Desktop</a> for Git.</strong> But I&#8217;m pulled back toward <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/mac">Tower</a> because I think the features are nicer. But I&#8217;m really torn as GitHub Desktop is free and works flawlessly with things like precommit hooks that Tower sometimes has trouble with. </li>



<li><strong><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> for TODOs</strong>. I&#8217;m still really happy with Things and don&#8217;t feel any particular pull away from it. Other than that my TODOs are fairly disjointed overall. My inboxes are TODOs. My notes app can have TODOs. My open tabs can be TODOs. GitHub issues and pinned Notion pages can be TODOs. I wouldn&#8217;t mind a smidge better consolidation. Really wish it supported images/videos.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> for notes</strong>. Everyday I find myself needing a notes scratchpad to write things down and it&#8217;s always Bear for me for this. I&#8217;ve had two failed-starts with <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> though and feel a pull toward that. </li>



<li><strong><a href="https://mimestream.com/">Mimestream</a> for Gmail.</strong> Surprises me as I&#8217;ve always like the web interface for Gmail, but I&#8217;m a few years on Mimestream now and feeling no big desire to leave it. Although, I&#8217;ve now got Fastmail going now too and find it very nice. I&#8217;ve got <a href="https://coyier.com/">coyier.com</a> now and <a href="mailto:chris@coyier.com">chris@coyier.com</a> as well as setting up some family member emails through it, all through Fastmail. </li>



<li><strong>More Discord than Slack</strong> for group chat. I&#8217;m still in a few Slacks, including the internal CodePen Slack that is my most important one, but not terribly busy. I do more active chatting on community Discords than I do in Slack. </li>



<li><strong>Zoom for video calls</strong>. But gosh, wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to get off Zoom? Like maybe Google Meet is good enough since we pay for an organization there anyway? Maybe the stuff built into Slack is fine? I don&#8217;t need any features of Zoom at all other than &#8220;look at each other and talk and share screens sometimes&#8221; and it feels like that&#8217;s a commodity now and Zoom as a standalone could go.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://localwp.com/">Local</a> for WordPress Local Dev.</strong> But I think I&#8217;d rather get on <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/">Studio</a> as I&#8217;m on <a href="https://pressable.com/">Pressable</a> hosting now and quite happy with that and Studio seems more integrated. </li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.busymac.com/">BusyCal</a> for calendering.</strong> But I feel like I don&#8217;t have any specific love for BusyCal. Would Apple&#8217;s default Calendar be good enough? Apparently I can&#8217;t use Google Calendar directly as there is no great way of seeing events from multiple accounts without weird trickery (which is wild??). </li>



<li><strong><a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> for RSS.</strong> But I also use <a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/2024/07/unread-for-mac-available-now/">Unread</a>. And <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> for iOS, but the classic one not 4. But it&#8217;s all powered by <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a> under the hood. </li>



<li><strong><a href="https://ghostty.org/">Ghostty</a> for a terminal.</strong> But I&#8217;m switching back to <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>. Ghostty is nice in how painless it is to switch to it, but I don&#8217;t need it to be so feature-free. The lack of search in Ghostty is the main thing pushing me away.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.figma.com/files/team/291600168696480805/recents-and-sharing?fuid=291600039840632288">Figma</a> for design.</strong> Whatever though I don&#8217;t do a massive amount of design outside of the browser. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d be happy in <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a> or whatever Adobe thing. To me the killer feature of Figma is that it&#8217;s web based so it&#8217;s easy to link to things and share across a team.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://sindresorhus.com/system-color-picker">System Color Picker</a> is the best for color. </strong></li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a> for a launcher</strong>, but I make so little use of it&#8217;s robust feature set it&#8217;s tempting to just nuke it can go back to spotlight. </li>



<li><strong>Arc for a browser.</strong> I&#8217;m <em>still</em> annoyed with the abandonment of Arc, as it&#8217;s just a damn masterclass in browser design. I switched away for most of the year, giving other browsers a real shot, using them for a week+. I tried Dia but it&#8217;s just shallow shadow of Arc. I tried Orion and switched away for reasons that ended up being my fault (it was nice though, expect for Safari DevTools), and same deal with SigmaOS. I tried Zen which was quite nice but didn&#8217;t sync as well as I needed it to. I tried Shift, Atlas, etc, there are so <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/newfangled-browser-alternatives/">many</a>. But Atlassian <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/atlassian-acquires-the-browser-company">buying</a> The Browser Company of New York because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/web/770947/browser-company-arc-dia-acquired-atlassian">the CEO loves Arc</a> was encouraging to me and I switched back. Haven&#8217;t seen any big Arc improvements, but whatever, it still works great.</li>
</ul>



<p>I also maintain my subscription to <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/5y23p7up">SetApp</a>, because I use a handful of things it offers that makes it super worth it: <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/tableplus">TablePlus</a>, <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/typeface">Typeface</a>, <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/paste">Paste</a>, <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/cleanmymac">CleanMyMac</a>, <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/bartender">Bartender</a>, etc. </p>

<p>Three good thoughts <a href="https://fs.blog/brain-food/december-28-2025/">from Shane Parrish</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Short-term results come from intensity. Long-term results come from consistency.</p>



<p>**</p>



<p>Ninety percent of success can be boiled down to consistently doing the obvious thing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing yourself that you&#8217;re smarter than you are.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Working smart isn&#8217;t the opposite of working hard. It&#8217;s the result of working hard.</p>



<p>You have to put in the hours before you can see the shortcuts. You have to learn the details before you can know which ones matter.</p>



<p>You have to do the work wrong many times before you discover how to do it right.</p>

<p>Feels like this is on the right side of history. This just opens up the physical activity of mountain biking to more people (like me) and makes it more fun for others. Like how they stock lakes with fish&#8230; because it&#8217;s fun. This isn&#8217;t a fundamental shift to the trails, like allowing motorcycles on them would be. This is a more subtle, and welcome change. I don&#8217;t give a shit if I&#8217;m side-eyed on trails for riding my eMTB, but it&#8217;s nice to not be breaking the rules. </p>
