Honestly... AI and all the hype surrounding it really annoys me! I'm a sceptic. I do believe that this technology has a definite advantage over humans in comparative methods such as visual cancer screening and can help us in this area, but I find generative AI and the simulation of human interaction deeply inhuman and destructive. The fact that LLM's are mostly backed by profit-driven and power-hungry companies that have already proven in the past that they have no moral compass, makes the whole thing even more disturbing and dangerous.

As fascinating as [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) may be, for example, it is exclusively repetitive and means that humans hardly need to have any negative experiences with machines in order to achieve their goals, which ultimately prevents them from growing and improving. With AI of this kind, we will eventually only be dealing with idiots ...

<p style="padding-inline: var(--space-median); font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold)">For this reason, every word and every pixel on this page is AI-free and comes exclusively from my brain and my fingers, which are controlled by it.</p>

Unfortunately, I can't say much about the tools used to build this site, such as Hexo and the many NPM packages behind and alongside, but I'll keep my eyes open and take action if necessary.

I want to surround myself with creative and thoughtful people in the digital world too, which is why I am part of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) and the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), where AI plays no role whatsoever, partly because it's not about money but about people.

OK, my thoughts on AI here read like a rant and are not very nuanced. The technology certainly has potential and a future ... if we don't allow it to be misused (as is so often the case) for sinister purposes.

The impetus if creating this page was the [AI Manifesto by Damola Morenikeji](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto).
