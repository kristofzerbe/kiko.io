Almost every day, while reading news and social media posts, I stumble across small **web tools** that can make developer life immensely easier. In order not to lose sight of them, I have created a collection in Trello, which are automatically listed here.

See also my [Tools](/collections/tools) page, where I have listed my essential Windows software.
