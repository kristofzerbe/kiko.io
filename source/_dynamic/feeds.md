For years, I had integrated only one [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)) feed in this blog, which gave an excerpt of the article to the posts and a link to read more. A poll on Mastodon on the topic [made me change](/notes/2023/feed-full-length-article/) to the full article text ... but this also meant that the feed size grew by about 80%, which is also not okay for everyone.

On this page you will now find not only both Atom feed variants for my [**Posts**](/archives), but also some in the good old [RSS 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) and the relatively new [JSON feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Feed) format. More feeds for my [**Notes**](/notes) will be available here later on also.
