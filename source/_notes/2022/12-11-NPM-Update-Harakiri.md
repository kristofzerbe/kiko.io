Software developers are lazy people per se. The engine of an entire industry is laziness.

"_Naah, I don't feel like writing my own code. I'll take some random NPM package, even if it's trivial functionality and only three lines of code._"

Guys ... take responsibility for your code! Copy as much as you want, but understand what the code does and make it your own!
I am so annoyed by misused frameworks and NPM update nightmares!
