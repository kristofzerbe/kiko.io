Sometimes it is advisable to outsource functionality into seperate NPM modules. But to avoid having to run ``npm publish`` (module) and ``npm install`` (main project) every time a change in the module takes place, it's relatively easy to include the module's source code directly in the main project:

``npm install /absolute/path/to/the/package``

or to use ``npm link``, which works with global symlinks, but does not save the dependency in package.json.
