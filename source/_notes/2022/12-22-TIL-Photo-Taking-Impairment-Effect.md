The memories of beautiful moments in life are one of the most valuable things a person can have. A wedding, a breathtaking landscape or whatever moments it may be that make you happy. In many such moments in my life I had a camera with me and often I had the feeling to "miss" something while taking pictures.

This morning I learned that this feeling has a scientific background and even a name: **Photo-Taking Impairment Effect**. This is an offloading process of the brain. It thinks to itself "Ah, he takes photos anyway, then I don't have to store the memory in such detail."

The question now is whether you can outsmart the brain by, for example, first looking at a beautiful landscape for an hour and soaking up the scenery and then taking a few photos, or whether you should first take a few photos and then sit down in peace and enjoy? If then, unfortunately, this doesn't work for action-packed memories...
