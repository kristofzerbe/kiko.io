I mostly use my smartphone indoors, which is due to the German weather most of the year. But now I'm lying under a parasol on a beach in Portugal, annoyed by the playful instincts of some stoned Android engineer who thought it would be cool to dim the screen brightness by half, EVEN THOUGH the user has set it to 100%, turned off sh*** automatic brightness and has already tried several times to reset the settings in 'Device Health Services'.

Damn machine, STOP THINKING FOR ME! I know better what I want!

(Now you can probably guess why I'm skeptical about AI when a global corporation can't even control the brightness of its devices ... we will all die)
