My Twitter account has been closed since 20 November 2022, but I hadn't deleted it yet because I didn't want anyone to reuse my handle back then. That's over now. The thing is going in the bin. I will try to delete all my old tweets with Lucas' [tweetXer](https://github.com/lucahammer/tweetXer) and then deactivate the account so that it is deleted after 30 days. (It's annoying me again that there's no simple DELETE button on this f*** platform)

I was triggered by Matthias, who has just deleted all Twitter meta tags from his website and I have been doing the same for the last half hour. Including all syndications and links ... and my eyes fell on the old account 'kristofz' again.

Matthias is right when he says *"I don't want to link to a Nazi's website"*. In the meantime, nothing justifies having anything to do with Elon Musk's far-right propaganda machine.

**UPDATE:** After two days, my data backup arrived today and thanks to tweetXer all followers and tweets are deleted. My Twitter account is now deactivated and waits for deletion in 30 days.

So I just removed all Twitter meta tags and links to my abandoned profile from my personal site, and will remove all tweets from my blog posts as well. You should probably do the same.f u Elon, from the bottom of my heart. #fcknzs"
