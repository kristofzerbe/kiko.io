I always think it's great when another blog starts supporting [Webmentions](https://kiko.io/search/?q=webmention). Unfortunately, there are still far too few. In my opinion, it's a fantastic way to connect blogs without having to rely on third-party platforms.

I find it particularly exciting to experience almost live how someone is tackling the somewhat steep learning curve of implementation, as [Chi Se√±ires](https://chisenires.design/) from the Philippines is currently doing. In her post [**My personal website should have support for webmentions now**](https://chisenires.design/blog/my-personal-website-should-have-support-for-webmentions-now/), she describes her attempts, progress, and next problems in chronological order. I would like to applaud and cheer her on, because I know how mentally challenging it can be at times, but it is worth the effort.
