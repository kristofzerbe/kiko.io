Today, after many, many years and the last 5 months of abstinence, I have approved my #Instagram account for deletion. June 29, 2025, is the day... and no, I'm not changing my mind. My last post was in 2021, and my brain is too valuable to me for doom scrolling bullshit. That also means #Threads is done for me, even though I thought for a brief moment that Meta might be serious about the #Fediverse. Muahaha...
