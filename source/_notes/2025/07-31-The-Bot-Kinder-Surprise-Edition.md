My sweetheart loves crocheting, and she often makes little figures out of the inner shells of surprise eggs, which she then crochets over. Bears, penguins, monkeys, elephants... I posted [pictures](https://pixelfed.social/p/kristofz/713641773247406967) of them on Pixelfed once. Now she has crocheted me the Android bot as a visible sign that I will never have an iPhone in my pocket.
