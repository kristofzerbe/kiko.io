Since I recently completed my little [blogroll](/blogroll), it has become a daily routine for me to look for the latest posts here first, because when it is created, the last post of each of my favourite bloggers is read from their feed. Conveniently, my Custom-SSG-Blogroll-Generator sorts the items directly by the latest post date in descending order when it is generated and it runs every night. Fetching the posts takes place asynchronously, but I have a short timeout and exit directly in the event of any errors in order not to compromise the deployment. I can recognise errors by the small text "*Failed to read the feed. Tryin' again tomorrow...*", which is where the link to the last post should be. Can happen sometimes...

In the deployment logs, however, I keep noticing that some feeds are constantly close to the edge because they are clearly heavyweights and because today is Friday, I have decided to make a competition out of it and announce the biggest feed of my 37 favourite bloggers so far.

**--- POWER ON ---**

Hello dear readers. Welcome to the award ceremony of this year's Blogroll Feed Heavyweight Championship, here on kiko.io. Let's jump right in...

Unfortunately, **Lea Verou** ([lea.verou.me](https://lea.verou.me/)) is only in the ungrateful **4th place** and thus just outside the medal ranks with 228 posts and a volume of 1.62 MB. That's a pity, but I'm sure she can soon break into the upper ranks, especially as she already has a higher number of posts than our ...

... **3rd place** occupied by **Rob Knight** ([rknight.me](https://rknight.me/)) with an impressive 1.74 MB and a total of 219 posts. All respect. Mature performance. And that's ONLY his Post feed! With his Everything feed, he might even make it to the top next time.

The **2nd place** is secured by a good margin and thus currently unchallenged **Michelle Barker** ([css-irl.info](https://css-irl.info/)) with great 249 posts and a 2.23 MB thick feed. Congratulations on second place!

But our undisputed champion and thus **KIKO.IO's BLOGROLL FEED HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WOOOOOORLD** is: 

<p style="font-size:4rem;float:right;">üèÜ</p>

**Juha-Matti Santala** ([hamatti.org](https://hamatti.org/)) with an incredible 363 posts and a fantastic 2.86 MB, which would make any parser break out in a sweat in the short space of time. What an achievement!

This is the end of our live broadcast. Until next time, when it's time to see who has the biggest feed!
