It was an honor to make the IndieWeb Webring a little better with [my hint](/notes/2024/The-fun-of-randomness-in-a-Webring/) and thanks to Marty's quick response I now have my random toy and pastime again ;)

Of course, I immediately added the new ``/random`` link and replaced the old emoji-style links with the normal ones, because Marty's [link checker on the dashboard](https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/dashboard) reminded me to do so. However, the following recheck resulted in a new warning:

:D Marty ... there is still a little something to fix ;)
