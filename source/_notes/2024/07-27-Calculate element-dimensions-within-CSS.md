Somehow it's apt that [Temani Afif](https://css-articles.com/) has published his latest post on frontendmasters.com, because that's what he truly is: A Frontend Master. No one impresses me more with his ideas for what and how to use CSS. He thinks and breathes CSS.

[In this article](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/how-to-get-the-width-height-of-any-element-in-only-css/) he utilizes the Scroll-Driven animations feature to make calculations over the size of arbitrary elements, which is not what it was intended for ... Attention: Hack, but er very useful one!

And simply because he can, he adds a line counter and the conversion of a native progress element into a circle at the end ... Really impressive!
