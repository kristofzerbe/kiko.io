Without realizing it, [Marty](https://martymcgui.re/) has robbed me of my favorite toy: Accessing random pages of the [Indieweb Webring](https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/) and either creeping me out or continuing to surf the site with a smile.

He's right that you don't really expect to be taken to a random page when you click on NEXT, which his June update cleans up, but I really miss the RANDOM link. Please, Marty, provide such a link.

(So as not to drift into walled garden reels, I'm now also a member of the [CSS JOY Webring](https://cs.sjoy.lol/) from [Sara](https://front-end.social/@sarajw) and diligently hitting RANDOM ;)

Perhaps one of many who noticed that the \"previous\" and \"next\" links were actually going to random active member sites in the ring?I'm pleased to announce that the \"next\" and \"previous\" links between webring member sites should now be, more or less, deterministic! For example, if you visit gRegor's site, scroll to the webring links at the bottom, and click \""
