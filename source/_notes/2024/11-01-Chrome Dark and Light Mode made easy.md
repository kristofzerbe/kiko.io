Some like it light, others dark. Yet others, like me, [prefer it dark, but need it light to read](https://kiko.io/post/Don-t-be-ignorant-and-offer-a-theme-switch/) ... we're talking about websites, color schemes and the impossibility of pleasing everyone. 

While, [Sara](https://front-end.social/@sarajw) recently gave [on CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/come-to-the-light-dark-side/) a really good insight into how any blog owner can quickly and easily implement color theme switching, people need to see the necessity and implement it. Unfortunately, you can't expect that. 

But [Bramus](https://front-end.social/@bramus) comes to the rescue, at least for the desktop, with his new extension **[Chrome Dark Mode Toggle](https://www.bram.us/2024/10/30/chrome-dark-mode-toggle-v1-1/)**, which anticipates what Google wants to build into the browser directly at some point: the user decides centrally in the browser how they want it, light or dark.

> This extension allows you to override the value of `prefers-color-scheme` on a per-origin basis. That way, if a site uses `prefers-color-scheme` in their stylesheet, you can keep your OS in Light Mode while watching a site in Dark Mode (or vice versa).

The thing works great, even if it only gets me a little further personally, since I spend 80% of my reading time on my smartphone and ... no extensions are supported in Chrome for Android :|
