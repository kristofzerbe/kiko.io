I've been in IT too long not to be sceptical about the many hypes I've come across so far. This includes the current madness surrounding #ChatGPT and its peers. 

If #AI causes you to get moist spots somewhere on your body, read the post by [@ludicity](https://mastodon.sprawl.club/@ludicity), who as a data scientist is somewhat close to the topic and reacts as follows to the cheering about the AI industry, which is imho mainly driven by false promises and greed:

> I'm going to ask ChatGPT how to prepare a garotte and then I am going to strangle you with it ...

Absolutely great piece of writing. I'm still laughing.
