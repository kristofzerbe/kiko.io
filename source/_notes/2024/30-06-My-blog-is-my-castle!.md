Juha-Matti answers my question of why I'm doing this blog at all. On the one hand, because I am technically able to do it and it is incredible fun **(Playground)** and on the other hand, because I have had the feeling of being utilized for long enough (**Ownership** and **No Middle Man**). 

But the motivation that is becoming more and more important to me is to create MY OWN space, my home ground, my digital centre on the web (**Home Address**), where I decide on the **Permanence** myself, even if I know that I can't influence all the surrounding conditions and am ultimately dependent on some company to keep my blog alive and accessible.
