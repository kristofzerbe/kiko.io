Normally I'm coding something and later on I decide if it's worth to write about it and I make a post. Last weekend I started to code something, but had too little time and started to capture my ideas directly in a blog post. This resulted in an almost finished post without me writing a single line of code.

This is incredibly effective, because in most of my posts I explain in a structured way how I came up with the solution. If I write before I code, most of the thinking is already done. I just must not forget to write the code then ... ðŸ˜‰
