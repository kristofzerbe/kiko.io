This morning I stumbled across an interview with a 100-year-old blogger in a German news magazine. Peter Meissen was born in 1922 and started telling his story to his grandchildren 6 years ago. Poverty, war, reconstruction, his daily life today. It is heartwarming and disturbing at the same time to read it all first hand. Just a few people want to talk about Nazi Germany. I could hardly stop reading, especially because so much is currently being repeated in #Ukraine...
