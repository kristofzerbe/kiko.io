This morning I stumbled across an interview with a 100-year-old blogger in a German news magazine. Peter Meisen was born in 1922 and started telling his story to his great- and grandchildren 6 years ago. Poverty, Nazis, war, reconstruction, his daily life today. It is heartwarming and disturbing at the same time to read it all first hand. I could hardly stop reading, especially because so much is currently being repeated in #Ukraine...
