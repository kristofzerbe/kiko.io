WebDevs use INPUTs all the time, but often neglect to set the right attributes, especially for mobile devices. Alex Holachek has already created a very practical playground for the use of ``type``, ``inputmode`` and ``autocomplete`` in 2020. It shows you the resulting keyboard layout for Android/iOS and links to the appropriate docs.
