In this worth reading article, Stephanie Stimac ([@seaotta](https://toot.cafe/@seaotta)) shows the possibilities of using **``text-wrap``** in CSS to improve the typography of body text. On the one hand, there is the value ``balanced``, which ensures that text that goes over several lines is distributed over them as balanced as possible, and the still experimental ``pretty``, which is supposed to prevent that individual words of a paragraph are placed in a last otherwise empty line.
