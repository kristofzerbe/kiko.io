Refactored the photo section on my blog and started to cross post some photos on my new [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org) account [@kristofz@pixelfed.social](https://pixelfed.social/kristofz) and would like to collect and display the likes and comments as usual via [brid.gy](https://brid.gy/)   ... but between [@snarfed](https://fed.brid.gy/user/snarfed.org) and [@dansup](https://mastodon.social/@dansup) it seems to be stuck somewhere...
