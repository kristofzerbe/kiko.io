In concepts, manuals, prototypes and the like, it happens again and again that one uses for illustration web domains like **domain.com** or similar. However, this can only be done safely with the following 4 domains registered and blocked by IANA since 1992:

- example.com
- example.net
- example.org
- example.edu

The German **beispiel.de** is not one of them, even if its owner provides it for this purpose.
