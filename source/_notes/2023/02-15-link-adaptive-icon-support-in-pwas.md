On Android smartphones, the icons of the apps can be adapted to one's own taste in terms of shape. Rectangle, circle, drop ... you name it.

This of course applies to PWA's as well and it is to be hoped that the developer has thought of providing maskable icons to support this. Tiger and [Thomas](https://toot.cafe/@tomayac) show how this works in this article.
