Each browser or browser engine interprets the common CSS rules a bit differently, especially with the default values. A general reset to your own standards is very helpful. Andy Bell's [Modern CSS Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset/) is a kind of gold standard in this respect. He has now modernized this and a few things came up for me that were new to me or that are in some forgotten notes. Future me, please apply:

- text-size-adjust: none;
- text-wrap: balance;
- text-decoration-skip-ink: auto;
- scroll-margin-block: 5ex;
