This morning I stumbled across a Mastodon post that was excited about a Twitterwall-like alternative for Mastodon: [https://github.com/rstockm/mastowall](Mastowall 1.1).

Yes, the web solution is cool. It takes up to three hashtags, retrieves posts from a defined server every 10 seconds via <server>/api/v1/timelines/tag/<hash> as JSON and renders them as cards in a masonry grid on the page. A wonderful and useful little tool.

But the most interesting thing about it, is the following statement from the author on GitHub:

> It was written entirely by ChatGPT4, guided only by text prompts.
