This morning I stumbled across a Mastodon post that was excited about a Twitterwall-like alternative for Mastodon: [**Mastowall**](https://github.com/rstockm/mastowall) from [@rstockm](https://chaos.social/@rstockm)

Yes, the web solution is cool. It takes up to three hashtags, retrieves posts from a defined server every 10 seconds via *&lt;server&gt;/api/v1/timelines/tag/&lt;hash&gt;* as JSON and renders them as cards in a masonry grid on the page. A wonderful and useful little tool.

But the most interesting thing about it, is the following statement from the author on GitHub:

> It was written entirely by ChatGPT4, guided only by text prompts.
