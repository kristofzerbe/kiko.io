Ever got crazy on CORS problems when using an API? While examine the code of Christian Heilmann's WebComponent [**github-include**](https://github.com/codepo8/github-include/tree/main), I stumbled over his fetching URL towards GitHub:

`let proxy = 'https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=';`

Never mind, but great...

#api #proxy #cors

```cardlink
url: https://allorigins.win
title: "All Origins"
description: "Pull contents from any page via API (as JSON/P or raw) and avoid Same-origin policy problems."
host: allorigins.win
```
