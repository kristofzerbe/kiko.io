Ever got crazy on CORS problems when using an API? While examine the code of Christian Heilmann's WebComponent [**github-include**](https://github.com/codepo8/github-include/tree/main), I stumbled over his fetching URL towards GitHub: 


`let proxy = 'https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=';`

Never mind, but great...

[https://allorigins.win](https://allorigins.win)

#api #proxy #cors
