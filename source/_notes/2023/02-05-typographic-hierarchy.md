I'm not a designated design specialist, but UI's are and always have been important to me as a visual person. However, all web or other interfaces I designed as a developer were only created based on my feeling whether it looks good to me or not. **Oliver Sch√∂ndorfer** in his article about typographic hierarchies translates my simple feeling into psychological contexts (goal, levels, effect) without drifting into science. Very nice and helpful article @ [https://pimpmytype.com/hierarchy/](https://pimpmytype.com/hierarchy/)
