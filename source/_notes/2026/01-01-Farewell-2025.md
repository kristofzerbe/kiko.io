I 've found 2025 to be a particularly difficult and challenging year, quite apart from the political madness that is unfolding in so many parts of the world and which cannot leave a political person like me unaffected. No, even on a personal level, I will not forget this past year. Starting with my return from an absolutely amazing holiday in South Africa and two other wonderful breaks in Portugal and Sweden, the year has mainly shown me my physical limits. Yes, 57 is no longer mid-20s, and some decisions and habits in my life are now taking their toll, along with a few others that I hadn't on the list.. and I'm struggling with that physically and mentally. Getting older is not for wimps...

My wish for 2026 is to achieve the serenity that allows me not to get upset about things I cannot change anyway, and to simply tackle those things that I can influence and shape.
