My newly awakened love for German soccer reached a small peak last Thursday when my colleague Uli asked me, if I would like to go to the evening match of his favorite club [**Eintracht Frankfurt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eintracht_Frankfurt) against [**HJK Helsinki**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsingin_Jalkapalloklubi) as part of the preliminary round of the [Europa Conference League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League). He had come by a happy coincidence to two tickets. Of course! Let's go!

Now I'm not an Eintracht fan, by any means. In the Rhine-Main area, the Frankfurt club is either hated or loved by the people, because its fan base is a bit more aggressive, i.e. they are disreputable and with them the club. But I've never been to the [Waldstadion](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldstadion) (as it used to be called) or the "Deutsche Bank Park" (as it's called if you put money on the table), one of the big soccer arenas in Germany, where international matches and other big events are also held regularly.

Getting to the stadium was an ordeal, because we had left our cars at the office and taken the cab, but the 55,500 spectators all seemed to want to park right in front of the arena so the traffic jam was immense. The last kilometer through the forest to the stadium and the Jürgen Grabowski grandstand to our seats were tough, at least for Uli, because his knee was hurting as usual. But the anticipation, a beer and an Äppler made up for everything.

What I found amazing, as a Waldstadion newbie, was that we entered the building at ground level, but came out in row 30. The whole thing thus reminded of a nicely designed giant pit.
