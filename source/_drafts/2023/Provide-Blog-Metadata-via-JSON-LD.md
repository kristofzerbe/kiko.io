Chris Coyier's post "[Open Graph Blues](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/01/28/open-graph-blues/)" got me thinking that my blog's metadata, which are used by Google among others to index my pages, aren't really at the cutting edge anymore. I took the markup of the individual elements of the pages via [schema.org](https://schema.org) Microdata attributes from the standard Hexo template years ago and always adjusted it by value, but never questioned that there are more modern variants to provide the metadata.

It's Ok for Google to use Microdata attributes, but the HTML code of my templates is getting more and more opaque, because next to these stick to the tags also those for the Indieweb, classes for CSS and last but not least those for the own indexing via Pagefind. There becomes from a simple

```html
<article>
  <h1>Title of my latest blog post</h1>
  <p> ... </p>
</article>
```

quickly becomes a ...

```html
<article class="article-type-post h-entry" 
        data-pagefind-body="" data-pagefind-meta="type:Article" itemscope itemprop="blogPost">
  <h1 class="article-title p-name" 
      itemprop="name">Title of my latest blog post</h1>
  <p> ... </p>
</article>
```

Lots of textual overhead and the hardest part is maintaining it over the long term. Better would be a complete search engine description in the haeder of a page, where also the other meta information is available. JSON-LD to the rescue...

## Structured Meta Data

Google has published tons of information in its [Search Central](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data) on how to place metadata on your page to be found more easily in the index. You can also see that they are maintained by the update date of individual pages, for example "*Last updated 2023-01-26 UTC*". End of last week. That's up to date, fine.

Of course, they also show how to use Microdata, but recommended is the use of [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), a structured and centralized inclusion of the required information via a SCRIPT tag in the header of the page. Thereby information about the **website** in general, the **author**, the **organization** behind it and the actual **article** page can be combined separately in one piece of JSON code.

{% alertbox warning %}
Google's solution is based on schema.org, but they have picked only what is necessary for them, which means: they deal only with a subset of the schema.org types.
{% endalertbox %}

Since it is somewhat cumbersome to write correct JSON-LD from AHnd, there are of course online editors for it, e.g. within the [web code tools](https://webcode.tools/generators/structured-data) or [Merkle](https://technicalseo.com/tools/schema-markup-generator/).

### Website

The part of the JSON related to my website looks like this:

```json
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org/",
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "@id": "kiko.io/#website",
  "url": "https://kiko.io",
  "potentialAction": {
    "@type": "SearchAction",
    "target": "https://kiko.io/search/?q={search_term_string}",
    "query-input": "required name=search_term_string"
  }
}
```

It is advisable to include so called **Node Identifiers** in order to reuse certain information later on as a refernece and prevent repeating data.

### Author

This is about me myself and I...

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "Person",
  "@id": "kiko.io/#person",
  "name": "Kristof Zerbe",
  "url": "https://kiko.io/about",
  "image": "https://kiko.io/images/kristof-zerbe.png",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://indieweb.social/@kiko",
    "https://github.com/kristofzerbe",
    "https://500px.com/p/kikon"
  ]  
}
```

### Organization

Most blogs are run by individuals and not necessarily by organizations, so you might think this area would not be interesting, but it is for a reason: only here you can deposit the link to a logo of your blog, which can then be displayed in the search.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "@id": "kiko.io/#organization",
  "name": "kiko.io",
  "url": "https://kiko.io",
  "logo": "https://kiko.io/images/apple-touch-icon.png"
}
```

## Test your JSON-LD

When you have everything together, it is advisable to test the resulting code. Schema.org offers such a tool at **[https://validator.schema.org/](https://validator.schema.org/)**.
