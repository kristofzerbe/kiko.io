After many years, I recently returned to [**Flickr**](https://www.flickr.com/), where I've been a member since August 2005. At the time of SmugMug's purchase of Flickr from Yahoo in 2018, and the limitations that came with it, I was more focused on the upcoming [**500px**](https://500px.com/) platform, which looked and functioned much more modern.

With the rise of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) and the [Fediverse](), however, the networking of my data, including my photos, is becoming increasingly important to me and so I got a [**Pixelfed**](https://pixelfed.org/) account in 2023 and publish more and more of my photos there as well.

However, you can tell that Pixelfed is basically just a developer who bears the main burden of further development and so even the networking of my photos, or the interaction with them, with my website doesn't work there. What I mean by this is that Pixelfed does not yet support [Ryan Barret's **bid.gy**](https://brid.gy/) due to a [bug in Pixelfeds implementation](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/927).

Interestingly, however, Ryan has been able to integrate Flickr into brid.gy (probably via their public API), i.e. if a photo in Flickr is linked to my website via the url, likes and comments show up as [Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) here.

500px, my regular photo platform in the last years, on the other hand, completely discontinued its API back in 2018 and is increasingly becoming an isolated photo license sales booth. A walled-garden platform as its best, which values interoperability in no way whatsoever.

So now I have my own website and its photo pages and three completely different public platforms where I publish them. Each of these platforms has its advantages but also its disadvantages and I would like to make a completely subjective comparison of the three from my point if view in this post.

## Features

I'll skip all the commercial features here, that might be of interest to professional photographers, because they're not for me. My photos are all under a [CC-BY-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), which means that anyone who likes them can use them, as long as they attribute the author, which means me.
