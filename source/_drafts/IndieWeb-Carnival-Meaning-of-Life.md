I don't often participate in the [IndieWeb Carnival](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival). The last thing I contributed was in November 2024 with my post [You will never know whose butterfly you were](/post/You-will-never-know-whose-butterfly-you-were/en) on the topic of "Impact." Maybe I should do it more often, because it's really exciting to read other people's posts on the same topic. Different opinions offer new perspectives. 

This month's topic from [Jeremiah](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/) really triggered me this time, and I've been thinking about it for days... [**The Meaning of Life**](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/2026-01-indieweb-carnival/) ... and here are my two cents on the matter.
