Due to my daily routine, I'm reading a lot of articles on the web regarding software development. 

The most interesting stuff ends up on my Pocket list, which grows from day to day. Hard to find the pearls, when I need them. This recurring posts will throw a stroke of light on them.

They are maybe not the newest finds, not the fanciest ones, but remarkable for me and maybe for you also.
