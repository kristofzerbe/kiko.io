It is so amazing how many cool stuff developers around the world are producing these days. Or they do what they always do, but I have more time to read about their smart ideas and solutions. This month I have 8 pearls for you:

{% anchorlist 
  "waitForElementTransition()|waitForElementTransition" 
  "Using Flexbox and text ellipsis together|flexbox-and-ellipsis" 
  "Using Trello as a Super Simple CMS|using-trello-as-cms" 
  "Memorize Scroll Position Across Page Loads|memorize-scroll-position" 
  "A free guide to HTML5 &lt;head&gt; elements|head-dev" 
  "BVSelect - Vanilla JS|bv-select" 
  "A clock that represents the time as hex color values|hex-time" 
  "Animate.css - Just-add-water CSS animations|animate-css"
%}
<!-- more -->

{% discovery "waitForElementTransition()" "Mark Kennedy" https://github.com/mkay581/wait-for-element-transition Discoveries-4 waitForElementTransition.png %}
  In these days a good UI doesn't do without some animations or transitions and it is always advisible to use CSS for it, if possible. Marks shows us with his solution, how to wait in JavaScript for a transition to finish, before we continue to do something else in JS.

{% discovery "Using Flexbox and text ellipsis together" "Leonardo Faria" https://leonardofaria.net/2020/07/18/using-flexbox-and-text-ellipsis-together/ Discoveries-4 flexbox-and-ellipsis.png %}
  In case you offer downloads with very long file names from time to time, you might use CSS's ellipsis to cut it down. But you always loose the last three chars, the file extension. Leonardo show us, how to avoid that, by using a clever mix of ellipsis and flexbox.
{% enddiscovery %}

{% discovery "Using Trello as a Super Simple CMS" "Phil Hawksworth" https://css-tricks.com/using-trello-as-a-super-simple-cms Discoveries-4 using-trello-as-cms.png %}
  As I love Trello and use it daily, among others as a reading list (see {% post_link Add-website-to-Trello-card-the-better-way %}), I can't wait to try Phils approach to process Trello boards automatically.
{% enddiscovery %}

{% discovery "Memorize Scroll Position Across Page Loads" "Chris Coyier" "https://css-tricks.com/memorize-scroll-position-across-page-loads/" Discoveries-4 memorize-scroll-position.png %}
  Chris shows Hakim El Hattab's trick, how to store the current scroll position and restore it when user comes back. Simple, but a gain in usability.
{% enddiscovery %}

{% discovery "A free guide to HTML5 &lt;head&gt; elements" "Josh Buchea" https://htmlhead.dev Discoveries-4 head-dev.png %}
  Doing your Web Developer job right, means you have to be aware of the META tags in your HTML. htmlhead.dev is a good reference, because it lists and describes mostly all known META tags.
{% enddiscovery %}

{% discovery "BVSelect - Vanilla JS" "Bruno Vieira" https://bmsvieira.github.io/BVSelect-VanillaJS Discoveries-4 bv-select.png %}
  There are many HTML/Javascript driven dropdowns out there. So has Bruno, but his solution don't even looks nice, it is written in ES6, has no dependencies and is dead simple to use.
{% enddiscovery %}

{% discovery "A clock that represents the time as hex color values" "Jamel Hammoud" https://github.com/JamelHammoud/hextime Discoveries-4 hex-time.png %}
  The time is shown mostly as a six digit number ... Hours, Minutes and Seconds, with a leading 0. Color Hex codes have also 6 digits and Jamel  the idea to bring both together...
{% enddiscovery %}

{% discovery "Animate.css - Just-add-water CSS animations" "Daniel Eden" https://animate.style Discoveries-4 animate-css.png %}
  Daniel and his buddies offers an Stylesheet with dozens of cool and easy to use text animations.
