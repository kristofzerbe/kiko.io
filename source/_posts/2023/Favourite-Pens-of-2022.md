Every year CodePen publishes a list of the 100 most "liked" pens on their site: [The Most Hearted of 2022](https://codepen.io/2022/popular/). It's always exciting to scroll through the list and marvel at the incredibly good work of CSS artists.

From all these works you can take a lot of know-how for yourself, but many of these pens have no practical use at first, i.e. you can't really use them directly on your own website. They are art. Some of them impressed me not only because of their creativity, but I saved them on my own Trello list to try them out in one of the next projects.
