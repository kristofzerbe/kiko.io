I recently introduced a Bottom Sheet dialog on this blog to display a page's metadata, using Ali Dincer's work: [downupPopup](https://downuppopupjs.dincerali.com/). I described the way to do this in my post [Show pages meta data (JSON-LD) in Bottom Sheet](/post/Show-pages-meta-data-JSON-LD-in-Bottom-Sheet/).

Shortly after that [Koos Looijensteijn](https://octodon.social/@koos) triggered me with his post [How to make digital business cards and share them via QR codes](https://www.kooslooijesteijn.net/blog/digital-business-cards-vcard-qr-code-website) and I felt like using my newly introduced dialog manager based on downupPopup for my own contact card. But more about that at a later time, respectively blog post...

Important for this post is that Ali's bottom sheet solution did not offer everything I wanted for my implementation:

## Make Dialog Reusable

Ali's approach to calling the dialog was to create and initialize the necessary HTML elements if it didn't already exist in the DOM. I pulled out the initialization to make the component reusable. There is now a preparation part and an initialization part and the latter is always called, no matter if another bottom sheet dialog was already created before.

[My commit on this part](https://github.com/ali-dincer/downupPopup.js/pull/2/commits/f3751ca56c4809decc1ec3845e5c301a13292773)...
