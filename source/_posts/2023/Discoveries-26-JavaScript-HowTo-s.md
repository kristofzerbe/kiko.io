Over time, everyone accumulates links somewhere about procedures that one has not yet internalized. This is also the case with me and JavaScript development. "Damn ... what was that about Call | Proxy | Map | &lt;You name it&gt;?!". Here are 11 of them ...

Whenever images are to be processed in a NodeJS application, one is well advised to use the Sharp library. Pascal introduces the most important functions in his article.

Using console.log() for JavaScript debugging is the most common practice among developers. But, there is a lot more, as Marko shows us.

{% discovery "Simple Swipe with Vanilla JavaScript" "Ana Tudor" "https://css-tricks.com/simple-swipe-with-vanilla-javascript/" Discoveries-26-JavaScript-HowTo-s simple-swipe-with-vanilla-javascript.png %}
This 2018 article by Ana walks you step-by-step through implementing swipe gestures using an image gallery example with the least amount of code she could think of.

The File System Access API allows web apps to read or save changes directly to files and folders on the user&#39;s device. Thomas and Peter, both working at Googles Chrome team, show us with examples how this works.

{% discovery "An introduction to WebAssembly for JavaScript Developers" "Pascal Pares" "https://pascalpares.appspot.ovh/webassembly-for-javascript-developers/" Discoveries-26-JavaScript-HowTo-s an-introduction-to-webassembly-for-javascript-developers.png %}
Pascals article from 2021 is based on the specs of WebAssembly from 2019 and is very useful as an introduction for JavaScript Developers, because it includes a lot of sample code.
{% enddiscovery %}

{% discovery "Getting Started with the Map and Set Typed Collections" "Robert Laws" "https://javascript.plainenglish.io/javascript-getting-started-with-the-map-and-set-typed-collections-2ba173b0ce9f" Discoveries-26-JavaScript-HowTo-s getting-started-with-the-map-and-set-typed-collections.png %}
JavaScript has not only the classic arrays to offer, but also other objects for collecting data. Robert has a brief description of Set and Map.

{% discovery "JavaScript Currying: A Practical Example" "Karthick Ragavendran" "https://javascript.plainenglish.io/javascript-currying-practical-example-512cf1099e81" Discoveries-26-JavaScript-HowTo-s javascript-currying-a-practical-example.png %}
In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each of which takes a single argument ... a better description than Karthick’s introduction I could not think of either

{% discovery "How to Use the Call, Apply, and Bind Functions in JavaScript" "Keyur Paralkar" "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understand-call-apply-and-bind-in-javascript-with-examples/" Discoveries-26-JavaScript-HowTo-s how-to-use-the-call-apply-and-bind-functions-in-javascript.png %}
Call, Apply and Bind are not so common in daily JavaScript development, but they are useful tools because they can be used to change the execution context, as Keyur shows us.
{% enddiscovery %}

{% discovery "How JavaScript's Proxy Object Works" "Keyur Paralkar" "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-proxy-object/" Discoveries-26-JavaScript-HowTo-s how-javascript-s-proxy-object-works.png %}
Again Keyur. In this post he goes into detail about the proxy object, helps you create another object on behalf of the original object, to get more control over the interaction with the original object
{% enddiscovery %}

{% discovery "JavaScript waitFor Polling" "David Walsh" "https://davidwalsh.name/waitfor" Discoveries-26-JavaScript-HowTo-s javascript-waitfor-polling.png %}
By now, every JavaScript developer should be familiar with asynchronous programming using async/await and Promises. But there are use cases where polling makes more sense, as David shows.

MDN recommends using the Performance API to gauge the performance of websites and web applications. It’s useful to show how much time did it take to load a page.
