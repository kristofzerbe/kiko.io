In September, my wife and I took a trip to the [Museum of Technology in nearby Speyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technik_Museum_Speyer). I don't really know why I've never been there before, not even as a child, because the collection of cars and aeroplanes is quite unique in Germany. A dream for every boy, even if he's not as young as he might think :)

Built on the old site of an aircraft manufacturer, the 100-year-old hangars provide the perfect space for exhibiting large vehicles with wheels and wings. And exactly this can be found in Speyer: A large part for cars of all kinds and the outside area for aeroplanes and even ships. Even a spaceship, the Russian Space Shuttle alternative [Buran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_programme) can be seen there.

Here are a few pictures of the car exhibition that I brought back from there and which will be used as post header images hero on kiko.io in the future ...
