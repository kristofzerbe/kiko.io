As this blog is a static one, generated by [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and hostet at [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/), the page which was shown, when a user enters an Url which points to nowhere, was the default GitHub 404 page.

Not optimal and should be solved by an own Hexo page, because **GitHub Pages allows you to deliver a custom 404 page** by creating simply a ``404.html`` in the root of the website.

As you can create separate pages in Hexo, this is done quickly by:

```cmd
hexo new page "404"
```

It generates a new folder named ``404`` in your ``source`` folder, where a ``index.md`` is placed. In this file you can enter the text as Markdown  you want to show to the user, in case of a 404 error (page not found) occurs.

On generating the static files by ``hexo generate``, a subfolder ``404`` with a ``index.html`` will be created, which doesn't really work with GitHub Pages, because it needs a ``404.htm`` in the root.

You can fix this, by defining the ``permalink`` in the Frontmatter of your page:

```yaml
---
title: 404
permalink: /404.html
---
```
