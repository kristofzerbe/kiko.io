Earlier this year, my sweetie and I made a little trip to nearby Strasbourg. Not only because I really like the city and its French flair (she has never been there before), but also because I had never set foot in the **European Parliament** (EP) before. The people there have a big influence on our lives with their institutions and regulations, which eventually find their way into German law. As a committed European, you simply have to see it for yourself. And we live just 2.5 hours or 230 kilometers away.

The institution is very open. Guests are always welcome, even though tickets must be booked online in advance due to the large number of visitors. We were fortunate that on that day, the EP had invited young people from all over Europe to discuss issues important to them in the plenary chamber.

The building, which dates back to 1999, is impressive and beautifully located directly on a tributary of the Îll River, which winds its way through Strasbourg. It's wonderful to take a leisurely walk around the complex and feed the ducks on the river, as long as you have some stale bread with you.
