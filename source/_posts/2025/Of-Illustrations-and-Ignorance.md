This is a kind of promotional post. For David "ReverentGeek" Neal and his craft ... his art. But this is also a post about ignorance and repression ... on my part.

Let's start at the beginning. Many, many moons ago, I was hanging out on [Cory Dransfeld's website](https://www.coryd.dev/) and thought how cool his avatar was. It is a kind of comic book character, probably based on a real picture of him. I've been a comic book fan since my childhood, and I liked the style of Cory's picture so much that I wanted one of my own.

My thought was, that it couldn't be that difficult to find the online AI service that created Cory's image. I tried a few of the usual cartoonise tools, but without satisfactory results, so I lost interest. A few months later, it popped back into my mind and I once again tried to find the tool... again without success. Oh well, never mind. Somehow, it never occurred to me to just ask Cory.

A few days ago, while reading the news over my morning coffee, a [repost from a user called "ReverentGeek"](https://indieweb.social/@reverentgeek@techhub.social/114495450682753602) popped up on my Mastodon timeline. Not quite awake yet, I surfed around his website for a while, admiring the beautiful hand crafted illustrations, when suddenly Cory's avatar smiled at me.

Damn it! I was so fixated on the idea that one of those crazy, hyped-up AI tools has generated the comic avatar that I completely overlooked the fact that a human being had illustrated them! And this talented guy is called [**David Neal**](https://reverentgeek.com/) and he can do it way better than the bloody software.

Of course, I ordered an avatar from him straight away, but the whole thing also made  me stop and think, because in these oh-so-modern, digitalized times with AI around every corner, we seem to be losing sight of people. At least that's what happened to me, and I've made a firm resolution to pay less attention to software and more to the people who can do things for me that I can't.

It starts with a comic avatar, but continues when purchasing everyday products and services. It doesn't always have to be the convenient Amazon app; it could also be the shop in town that may have to order the item, but has a chance of surviving.

Focus on people ...
