I definitely don't know enough about **Web Components**, their possibilities, pitfalls, etc., but I want to learn more about them because I no longer do any programming in my day job, only tinkering around with this blog or small web apps in my spare time.

Over time, I've collected a few links on the topic that I think could be a good starting point for deepening my knowledge and putting it into practice.

Now all I need is the time...

The best start you can have into the world of Web Components is the work of Joeri. He explains very much of the techniques step by step and it is easy to follow. Chapeau!

Charaf's component for switching the theme on a website is actually useful enough and can be used right away. However, studying the code provides a good insight into the general structure of web components.

I guess Jared had a lot of fun implementing his fancy button as a Web Component using SVG and clipPath. A nice example of what's possible...

With his Scrolling Rails Control, Ryan also provides a very good insight into how Web Components work. I can hardly resist just using this control somewhere, because it is so good.

Joeri again. In this article, he shows us how to create a SPA and use a web component for delimiting and routing between the various views. A great boilerplate for small Web Apps.

Lean has rewritten his website completely in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and made heavy use of Web Components with light DOM. His approach is impressive and worth reading and considering for my.../yourself.

Mayank has created an abstraction layer for his Web Components in the form of a base class, which imho simplifies a few things. I found that thing on [David's post about his new RSS Web App Croissant](https://dbushell.com/2025/07/11/croissant-no-framework-web-app/). Impressing...

Lately he posted about a complete suite of Web Components to render simple [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/)Â objects, which were published under the patronage if the [Social Web Foundation](https://socialwebfoundation.org/2025/05/28/ap-components/), where he has the role of the Research Director.

The best for last. Anyone who runs a technical blog and displays code needs a syntax highlighter. AndrÃ© has packed all the functionality of such a tool into a web component! No more hundreds of SPAN tags in the source code.
