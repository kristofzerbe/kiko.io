With my ["Best Pix ... from the past"](/post/Best-Pix-from-the-past/) a few weeks ago, I opened a gate to my past that, given my limited free time, would have been better left closed. I'm spending a lot of time in Lightroom at the moment anyway, and I now have a thick, open folder on my desk with all the negatives I took with my analogue cameras when I was a teenager.

About four weeks ago, I sent the first 20+ sheets from three trips in the 1980s to a company specialising in film digitisation. Although I have tried to take well care of the negatives (mostly Kodak) over the past 40 years, they show clear signs of deterioration, and the company was unable to remove all of them, which is unfortunately also visible in the digital prints. Nevertheless, there are a few gems that I have pimped up as best I could with Lightroom over the last few days. In some pictures, I have even enhanced the trashy style instead of trying to remove it, because I think it gives them a unique and interesting look.

## Paris '85

During that decade, it was a very popular pastime among young people to take day trips by bus to nearby countries for very little money. That year, I went to Paris for the first time with my friend and schoolmate Dietrich (rest in peace, buddy). We didn't have much more with us than a small backpack, my camera, and a lot of stamina.

## USA '86

In 12th grade, all students at my school had the opportunity to participate in a student exchange program with Overton High School in Nashville, Tennessee, and I was one of about 20 students who embraced the adventure. And truly... I learned a lot about the country and its people from Barry, his little brother, his mother Debbie, and his stepfather Tommy... and formed bonds with the much closer town of Erkrath ;)

The highlight of the tour was definitely the three-day stay in the city that never sleeps, New York City. It was an exciting culture shock for German teenagers, scoring an 11 on a scale of 1 to 10.

## Southern France (Midi) '86

The last school trip with two classes to Avignon and the surrounding area with a bunch of teenagers who had nothing but nonsense on their minds. I turned 18 on the journey and, completely within my legal rights, got so plastered that I have no memory of this memorable day and my classmates asked themselves where I didn't throw up. The excursion to Nice was still nice, though...
