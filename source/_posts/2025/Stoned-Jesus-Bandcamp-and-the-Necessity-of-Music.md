Since yesterday, I know why I've been feeling like something's been missing. For months, I've been trying to deal with work stress by finding little or larger distractions that calm my brain down a bit, take my mind off things, and release some of the happiness hormones. Unfortunately, I was on the path of short video dopamine kicks for a while, but two weeks ago I gave up YouTube, my last platform of this kind. The end, over, done. Deactivated.

Yesterday, I was browsing through my favorite section, ROCK, on NRN ([newreleasesnow.com](https://www.newreleasesnow.com/new-rock-songs)) and stumbled across a band called **STONED JESUS**, whose (Spotify) teaser of the first song, NEW DAWN, from their new album SONGS TO SUN immediately electrified me. Man, what a blast! The hookline is very reminiscent of TOOL, who, in my opinion, performed the best song of all time with RIGHT IN TWO. Of course, I immediately bought the album on Amazon and downloaded it...

Download? Amazon? Yes, I'm not a streamer, I'm an owner. I completely reject music streaming. The musician makes music, the label distributes it digitally as MP3s, I buy it, put it in my digital "record cabinet" and listen to it wherever and whenever I want. I could accept streaming services managing my digital assets for a small fee, but instead, they are all predatory exploiters with questionable business concepts that only benefit themselves. Amazon is (of course!) no exception... apart from the fact that they actually still offer MP3 downloads, which has become very rare in the Spotify era.

However, I wasn't happy yesterday when I bought the SONGS TO SUN album on Amazon, because I have a pretty rough idea how much of the purchase price of around €6 actually ends up with the artist :| ... So I searched the internet for alternatives to buy more albums from the band and came across an old acquaintance: **[Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com)**. They promise that 82% will be paid out to the artist, but they tend to have indie labels in their program rather than the big bands. You can also stream via a proprietary app, but Bandcamp also offers a wide range of downloads for people like me... and makes it very easy to browse through similar music.

What can I say... at the end of the day, I had used up the small batteries in my Pixelbuds twice and spent almost 60 euros on Bandcamp for several albums by four bands. I didn't know three of them before: Stoned Jesus, of course, but also **Quintana** and **Howling Giant**. But now I'm listening to all three albums over and over again.

I started this text the way I did, because I realize how good hard rock, bobbing along, head banging, and pretending to play air guitar are for me right now. I have so much music in my sync folder, but I use it far too rarely for my well-being. That's going to change...
