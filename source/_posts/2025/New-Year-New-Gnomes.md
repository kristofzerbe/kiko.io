It's that time of year again: Thomas is digging. For a while now, as he said, because the first early bloomers in his garden have already gone the way of all things. I'm a bit late with the first photos, but here they are, continuing the series I started last year in my neighbor Thomas's garden.

Just in time for the first buds on the trees, two funny fellows have taken up residence in the garden, even though, judging by their clothing, they were hoping for summer.

I'm no gardening expert, but to me the garden seemed a bit bare and everything was quite dry. Thomas said the first thing is always like that at the beginning of the year, but he is also concerned about the second thing. It has rained very little in Germany in the last few weeks and that does not bode well for the coming months.

As I write this, the raingates are opening outside ...
