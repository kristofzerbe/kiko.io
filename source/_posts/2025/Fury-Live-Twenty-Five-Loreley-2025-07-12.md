Every German who is part of Generation X and a fan of rock music knows the band **Fury in the Slaughterhouse**, or **Fury** for short. They are not as well known internationally as the Scorpions, for example, but these guys have a head start of almost 20 years. Founded in 1987 (interestingly enough, also in Hanover, Germany), the Fury's had a major influence on German rock music in the early 1990s with songs such as _Radio Orchid_, _Every Generation Got Its Own Disease_ and _Won't Forget These Days_. At least, that's how it seems to me and especially to my wife, who has been listening to and loving these guys since she was 15.

Not many bands manage to stay on stage for almost 40 years with an almost identical cast. To do that, the guys need to have a gang spirit, and the Fury's have that. The "boys" (all in their early 60s) clearly had a lot of fun together last night during their sixth visit to the open-air stage on the [Loreley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freilichtb%c3%bchne_Loreley), and that rubbed off on the estimated 12 to 15 thousand fans, who only slightly lowered the band's average age.

At this point, I would like to express a minor criticism of the Fury's merchandise team: I buy a T-shirt at almost every concert, and there is usually a selection of designs to choose from. This was also the case this time... but how is it possible, given the average age of the audience, that XL shirts were sold out before the concert even started! Twenty years ago, I still wore L, but times change, and so do our bodies...

This Fury concert was my third, after an unplugged/acoustic concert in Olsberg in 2017 and one with the full orchestra in Frankfurt's Festhalle in 2022. My wife stopped counting after 10 concerts. The stage show was really good, not too bombastic or loud, but just right for the aging audience. So I can't agree with the two young people (in their early 30s, I'd guess) we met on the way to the parking lot, who left before the end of the concert because they found it boring and dull. I can still remember with horror the Mark Tremonti gig in Frankfurt a few months ago, where I felt like the blood was about to run out of my ears. Terrible, this urge to go to extremes.
By the way, we left before the end of the concert because we had absolutely no desire to leave the parking lot after midnight and wanted to get a head start on everyone else.

The Loreley open-air stage stands on the famous and legendary rock plateau near Sankt Goarshausen, around which the Rhine River has to make a sharp bend. During the day, Rheingau tourists bustle about with their selfie sticks because the view is truly romantic, and in the evenings during the summer, some band rocks the rock. The place is legendary, and although I live less than 40 minutes away and grew up there, yesterday was my first show at the Loreley... but certainly not my last.
