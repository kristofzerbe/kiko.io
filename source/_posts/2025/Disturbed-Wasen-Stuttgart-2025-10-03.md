3 October is a public holiday in Germany: Unity Day. As it fell on a Friday this year, my wife and I had a relaxed 2.5-hour journey to Stuttgart to see our favourite band, **DISTURBED** on their 25th Sickness Anniversary Tour. What we didn't realise, however, was that Europe's second-largest folk festival, the **Cannstatter Wasen**, was taking place right next to the concert hall and our hotel. 

The Schleyer Hall alone has a capacity of over 15,000 concertgoers, and there weren't many seats available, but the Wasen had to be closed briefly in the evening because there were already over 75,000 revellers on the site! What crowds...

But we seized the opportunity and went to the Wasen before the concert, with MEGADETH as the opening act, for a ride on the Ferris wheel, bockwurst and beer... and then again for a second round after the concert. So late in the evening, it was disturbing to see what alcohol does to people, but the sea of lights was spectacular from a height of 60 metres. I'd like to take a look at the electricity bill...

Of course, songs like *Stupify* and *Violence Fetish* are among my all-time favourites, but *The Sound of Silence* is a such masterpiece, that even Paul Simon himself is said to have called the best interpretation he has ever heard. And live, it's only slightly less good than on the album:
