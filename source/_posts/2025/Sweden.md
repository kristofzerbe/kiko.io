Before my sweetheart and I went to Sweden for a two-week relaxing holiday in August this year, I had honestly never looked into the geographical particularities of the area around Stockholm. All I knew was that they have a lot of water and boats there. I was familiar with the skerries and the tens of thousands of islands towards the open sea, but I wasn't aware that this was repeated west of Stockholm in the fresh water of Lake Mälaren.

We like to combine sightseeing with relaxation, so we chose a cute little house on Lake Mälaren in [Kungsberga](https://www.google.com/maps/place/179+97+Kungsberga,+Schweden), about 40 minutes from Stockholm. It was far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet close enough to make day trips in comfort. The area really has a lot to offer, not only **Stockholm**, but also the fortress in **Vaxholm**, the old Viking town of **Birka**, the open-air museum in **Södertälje**, and many, many other small and large attractions.
