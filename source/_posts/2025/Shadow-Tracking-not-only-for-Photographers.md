Photographs like the one illustrating this article would not be possible without the play of light and shadow. However, the emphasis here is on light. Without light, there would be no photography for me. Although I have a flash for my cameras, I never use it and could actually sell it.

Now, I really enjoy spending my weekends in my neighbor Thomas's garden, photographing his passionately cultivated flowers and other plants and their visitors. My only problem is always: WHEN do I go over to get the best light, because the garden is behind the house facing northwest, which means that in the morning the house casts a thick shadow over the garden, and it's only in the afternoon, when the sun has moved a bit, that the light comes in a little lower from the side and it's worth taking pictures. The two large trees on the western side of the neighbor's property and the different positions of the sun throughout the year don't make it easier for me to choose the right time.

Yesterday, I coincidentally came across a video on YouTube about [**shademap.app**](https://shademap.app/) ... and the web app solves my problem in a very elegant way.

The principle behind the app is to use elevation data to calculate the shadows cast by objects anywhere on a given point on Earth and display them as an extra layer on an OpenStreetMap. Using a time slider, you can now swipe forward in time and see how the shadows change. Perfect for my purposes. So today, between 2:45 p.m. and 4:15 p.m. would be the best time to hang out in Thomas' garden for a few shots. After that, the roses on the left will be in the shade again.

For Thomas, the "Hours of Sun" map view is very useful, as it allows him to estimate where sun-loving plants need to be placed so that they get their fair share of sunlight.
Another great feature of the app is that changes made to the map, such as the zoom level and other settings, are directly reflected in the URL parameters, allowing me to install it on my smartphone in such a way that our house and its shadow are immediately visible when I open it.

[**shademap.app**](https://shademap.app/) is a prime example of how technology can really make life easier, unlike some of the other gizmos that are currently being hyped.
