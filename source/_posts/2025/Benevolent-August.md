The last days of July in Germany were marked by lots of rain and wind, and the nasty weather continued into August. Not that I noticed much of it, as I was in Sweden with my girl, but I kept getting weather warnings for Wiesbaden on my smartphone and we weren't completely left out in the north either.

Just as we got back home, the sun popped out and the temperature shot up to over 30 degrees. This weather seems to be sticking around and shaping up to be the vibe for August.

The back and forth seems to have taken its toll on Thomas' garden, as some of the flowers are already looking quite bedraggled. But it could also be that their time is simply over... You know I don't know anything about plants... I just take pictures of them :)
