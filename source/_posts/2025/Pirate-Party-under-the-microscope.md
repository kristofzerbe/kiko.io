A few weeks ago, I received an email from **Kim Graves**, who is working on a book about the Pirate Party as part of her doctoral thesis at the **European School of Political and Social Sciences** in Lille (France). She would like to dedicate a chapter to a web tool called **OpenAntrag** that no longer exists, which at the time offered citizens the opportunity to submit proposals for political representation to mandate holders of the Pirate Party for consideration in parliament. Kim had me on her list because I wrote and ran the tool at the time. Currently, the only thing left of the original is the [GitHub page](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/OpenAntrag) with the source code, because I ended the project in 2019, but it seems to have had a long-term impact if you look at the Google results for the term 'OpenAntrag'.

I myself was a member of the Pirate Party Germany between 2010 (founding of the Wiesbaden District Association) and 2019 and, in addition to OpenAntrag and other web projects (pirat.ly, Pirateninfo), I also held various positions in the party, mostly as Secretary General, and found this time very fulfilling, even though I ultimately turned my back on the party after 8+ years. The main reason was probably that you have to be made of stern stuff to maintain your idealism regarding data protection, citizen participation and the like in the day-to-day work of the party, while ignoring the almost complete lack of interest of the voting population. There is a reason for the joke about the degrees of enemy: enemy - arch enemy - party friend. When I was still a party member, I always wondered why star members like [Katharina Nocun](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharina_Nocun) left the party and got involved in NGOs. Today, I can understand that quite well, because the party's goals are still close to my heart and every time I feel like using the Wahl-O-Mat (a tool that helps you compare the platforms of political parties in Germany), it comes up as my number one suggestion.

But back to Kim and her work. After a very pleasant and long conversation about OpenAntrag, she asked me via mail to take part in a study in the form of a questionnaire:

> As mentioned earlier, we are conducting a **European study with (current and former) members of the Pirate Party**.
> ...
> (The) study (is being) conducted by an international research team made up of researchers from [CSIC](https://ipp.csic.es/en) (Spain), [IIR](https://www.iir.cz/en/) (Czech Republic), [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/centre-etudes-europeennes/en/) (France) and the [Catholic University of Lille](https://espol.school/) (France). They are working together on a research project funded by the EU's Horizon Europe programme ([ActEU](https://acteu.org/)) project). The project is investigating the current crisis of political trust and legitimacy in European democracies.
>
> The survey is sent to current and former members of the French party La France Insoumise, the 5-star movement in Italy, Podemos in Spain, and the Pirate Parties in the Czech Republic, Germany and Luxembourg.
> ...
> Since there is no public list of Pirate Party members, we can only conduct the sampling using the "Respondent-Driven Sampling" method, which is based on **recommendation chains** from the respondents. This methodologically sound approach provides reliable results, provided that the respondents participate through the recommendation of others. We would be grateful if you would voluntarily recommend some of your pirate acquaintances to us, regardless of whether they are still members or have left the party.
> ...
> The results of the study will be published in May 2025 together with those of the other countries.

I am very glad to comply with the request for further distribution. **So, if you are or were a Pirate, be so kind and drop a line to Kim at [acteu.survey@univ-catholille.fr](mailto:acteu.survey@univ-catholille.fr)  and help make the study a success.**

Once more, because it was so much fun ... Arrrr
