A week in the Lisbon area (see my first post: [Colorful Portugal - Grande Lisboa](/post/Colorful-Portugal-Grande-Lisboa/)) is obviously not enough, but we nevertheless got into our rental car and drove 340 kilometers south to our next destination: **Burgau**, on the Algarve. The small town is just as picturesque as Azenhas (right up our alley) and not overrun with beach tourists like Albufeira (the worst I've ever seen).  
Interestingly, Burgau's beauty seemed to have attracted the attention of various "influencers" or "content creators," as some of the typical photos of this "industry" could be found online. Thankfully, we didn't come across any of these types of people. Well, it was only May, and I guess they don't come up until the water is warm enough.

Of course, we spent most of our time in the Algarve exploring the countryside, but this time we also had two days at the beach and made daring attempts to survive longer than five minutes in the bone-chilling Atlantic water. It's a crazy feeling when you're standing in water up to your hips, your upper body is still sweating, but you can't feel your feet anymore. Or maybe I'm just a wimp.

During a visit to Faro, the largest city in the Algarve, something curious happened: my wife (who is of Croatian descent) noticed that some men in the city were walking around wearing Croatian national jerseys, and a quick internet search revealed that a [European Qualifier football match between Gibraltar and Croatia](https://www.uefa.com/european-qualifiers/match/2044190--gibraltar-vs-croatia/timeline/) was scheduled for the very next day at the Estádio Algarve in Faro. Gibraltar is too small for a stadium of its own, and for political reasons, they probably don't want to go to nearby Seville, Spain. We quickly got tickets online for around €18 each and had a wonderful evening, including seeing superstar Luca Modric come on as a substitute and Croatia score seven goals.
