In 2024, the best wife in the world and I had decided that it was time to explore South Africa, especially as I had never been south of the equator, but she had already traveled to the southernmost tip of Africa with a friend 10 years ago and had been raving about it ever since. I also can't remember having allowed myself three weeks in a row to relax, but for a trip like this it needs to be, and preferably over the Christmas holidays to escape the hustle and bustle in Germany. No "Oh Tannenbaum", "Kling Gl√∂ckchen Klingelingeleing" with a disgusting warm spiced red wine in my hand, but elephant stamping at 32 degrees in the shade ... Yes!

We had planned our trip as a round trip: first Cape Town and Hout Bay, then east by car towards Mossel Bay and on to Addo. Then back via Plettenberg Bay and some Stellenbosch in the last two days to round off the experience. Always with me, of course, my camera(s) ... I had already assumed that I would take a few more photos in South Africa than usual, but in the end I ended up with 4,366 shots (!) and 82GB of RAW data, which I synchronized with my server at home wherever I had WiFi.

<!-- more -->

At some point I realized that I would need MONTHS to post-process the photos in Lightroom, as I always do. So I split the "work" into the individual stops and started with the highlights, the **Game Drives**. Plural, because we did a total of four guided tours in one week and three of them were always in the same park, the **Addo Elephant National Park**. Now you might think a day trip through the park would be enough and you would have seen everything, but it is so fascinating that I could have done it every day.

Here now my favorite photos from the park...

## Game Drive, December 27th

The starting point of our first tour was our accommodation, [Camp Figtree](https://www.oystercollection.co.za/camp-figtree/), and our guide was **Noma**, who took my wife, me and the lovely Agnese and Stefano from Italy on a full-day tour, including barbecuing and chilling out.

## Game Drive, December 29th

Two days later, we booked another tour straight away. This time it was only a half-day tour and with a few more guests, whose names I can't remember. We could have driven our own car without a guide, but this park is SO big and extensive that we preferred to rely on Noma's experience again ... and it paid off.

## Game Drive, December 31st

After four days at Camp Figtree, we moved on to the nearby [Addo African Home](https://www.addoafricanhome.co.za/) and went on another tour into the park on the last day of the year. This time with Philipp as our guide and without any other guests. We knew there were 5 lions in the park and Philipp did his best to track them down, but it wasn't to be.
