While preparing this new [AppDefaults](https://defaults.rknight.me/) post for the passing year 2025, I took a look back at the two previous posts from [2023](post/App-Defaults-2023) and [2024](post/App-Defaults-2024) and find it exciting to see how my behavior has gradually changed over time.

A slight shift away from the tools offered by large American companies towards small European alternatives or OSS, which is likely to intensify in the future. I also have less and less patience with software that is going down the path of [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification). I don't care how long I've been using it or how much work is needed to make the switch; it just has to go, even if it hurts, like Plex. I'm not going to be taken for a ride ... just die.

## Changes

One example of the slow shift away from American services is my new **Proton Mail** account under one of my own domains, kristofz.me. After 20 years of using Gmail, I no longer enter my old, familiar email address when registering for new accounts, but rather the new one, even though I am still a fan of Gmail in terms of comfort. However, the Swiss company Proton has opened security doors for me that I never thought I would need. Don't be evil ... Okay, but a little diversification is needed these days.

I'm increasingly opening websites in the **Vivaldi** browser, which is already installed on all my devices, even though I find all the bells and whistles a bit too much. Jón von Tetzchner is right to keep the European perspective and data protection in mind, whereas with Google Chrome, we know full well that this is a foreign concept to them.

When I tinker with software in my spare time, I do so 99% of the time in VS Code. I have completely stopped trying to work with online versions such as *github.dev*, as I mainly need such solutions on my smartphone and they simply don't work there.

What I have completely stopped using this year is *Trello*, as Obsidian now provides me with everything I need. Another thing that has disappeared into oblivion for me is *Plex*, once the best media solution, but now just one thing: crap. I now use **Jellyfin** instead.

## Looking ahead ...

I am thoroughly exploring the possibilities of self-hosting, albeit with regard to VPS services and not at home. This blog lives on *GitHub Pages* and is automatically built once a day via GitHub Actions to update the blogroll. I would like to separate this into a serverless solution so that I can host the code on my own **Forgejo** instance and simplify deployment via FTP when something substantial has changed. Elena Rossini contributed to these considerations with her [YunoHost posts](https://blog.elenarossini.com/tag/yunohost/).
