My [first photo post](/post/Addo-Elephant-National-Park) about my trip to South Africa was about pictures from the huge Addo Elephant National Park, where you can drive around for days and still see something new. Directly adjacent to it is the [**Schotia Safaris Private Game Reserve**](https://www.schotiasafaris.co.za/), a much smaller and privately run park that only offers guided tours, but with more service around it.

Another difference is that state-run national parks such as Addo are only allowed to have animals that occur naturally in the area. This is different in private reserves and so in Schotia (named after a protected old tree species) you will find giraffes, wildebeests, impalas, hippos, crocodiles and rhinos alongside the animals of the area, such as elephants, buffaloes, kudus and warthogs.

The HOW is also slightly different in Schotia. In the morning, around 100 people met at the central station, boarded a number of jeeps that had been converted into safari vehicles and swarmed out into the park, each guide to their own liking. Our guide was an old hand in the business and also promised us lion sightings that we had missed in Addo, but only later in the day. It was quite a wild ride through the park in places, as (thankfully) the roads had not been upgraded for comfort. It was fantastic and unforgettable!

But our guide didn't spare us the downsides of such an enterprise: the slaughter site of two adult rhinos, which had been killed the year before by poachers with helicopter support for their horns, each worth around $200,000. The perpetrators are now back in jail, but some Thai is now making tea from the horn to get a boner. Disgusting!

Towards the afternoon, all the guides searched a certain area for the lions and kept themselves informed by radio. They even had a car with a trailer rattling across the plain, in which the rangers usually transport dead animals and which normally attracts the lions. But ... Nothing. It was only in the evening, after dinner at the lodge in the middle of the park, that "*LIONS ON THE RUNWAY*" came over the radio and all the vehicles set off again to present 5 lions to the guests in the pale spotlight. The scene was really surreal and as a lion I would have been annoyed by the hustle and bustle, but they were lying relaxed in the grass and didn't give a shit.
