The credo of my photography has always been "Colors and Shapes." The more unusual and colorful, the better. I prefer small snapshots of life with lots of contrast and color, where my sweetheart always asks, "What is he shooting now?," and is amazed by the result. Of course, large, epic landscapes are always part of it, even if I always have to make compromises in terms of photographic knowledge, equipment, and time. People, on the other hand, have never really been in my focus, even if there have been one or two good photos along the way. Interestingly, when I was editing, human scenes always benefited from leaving out the colors completely and letting the little story in the photo come to the front without being distracted by colors. The exact opposite of my usual credo.

During my two-week vacation in Portugal in May, I naturally indulged in colors and shapes again, as you can see in my posts [Colorful Portugal - Grande Lisboa](/posts/Colorful-Portugal-Grande-Lisboa) and [Colorful Portugal - Algarve](/posts/Colorful-Portugal-Algarve), but wherever I went, I also looked for exciting human (or similar) moments and tried to capture them. This resulted in 60 Black & White photos that are worth seeing, and I would like to share them with you.

## Street Life

Sitting on the outdoor terrace of a caf√© on the edge of a large, bustling square, watching tourists stroll by or locals rushing to get things done, enjoying a cup of coffee. Not a minute goes by without something interesting, bizarre, beautiful, or even dramatic happening. How many times have I thought to myself: "Damn, that would have been worth capturing for eternity", and so I sit there with my camera on my lap, ready for those moments. The same goes for when I'm strolling across the square or through the narrow streets. My camera is ready to go, and the biggest drama is when I realize I've left my spare battery in the car.

## Beach Life

Not that I couldn't sit by the water for hours without a camera. Beach, cliffs, whatever, as long as there's water as far as the eye can see. But with a camera and a few people between me and the sea, it's much more exciting. In Ericeira, we sat above the busy beach for over an hour, watching people relax and making fun of how scared some of them were when they wanted to go into the 15-degree water.

## Perspectives

Without colors, many still lifes take on a slightly different meaning. They appear clearer and more pointed. The same applies to architecture, where the focus is then solely on the beauty of the shape of a building or part of it. With landscapes, it is usually somewhat different, because the contrast between the sky and the earth usually only has an effect when the colors we have learned are present and we can virtually transport ourselves into the landscape. However, there are also some beautiful exceptions.
