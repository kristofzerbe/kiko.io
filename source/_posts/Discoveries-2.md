## More Control Over CSS Borders With background-image
by Chris Coyier : [https://css-tricks.com/more-control-over-css-borders-with-background-image/](https://css-tricks.com/more-control-over-css-borders-with-background-image/)

![More Control Over CSS Borders](Discoveries-2/more-control-over-css-borders.png)

Borders are used to seperate things in a layout, but the build-in possibilities of CSS are restricted. Chris found a way by pimping borders up, using background images.

## A CSS-only, animated, wrapping underline
by Nicky Meuleman : [https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/blog/css-animated-wrapping-underline](https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/blog/css-animated-wrapping-underline)

![CSS-only, animated, wrapping underline](Discoveries-2/css-only-animated-wrapping-underline.png)

As Chris did for the borders, Nick's doing on underlined links. An end to boring rigid unterlines, let's animate them.

![Nailing the Perfect Contrast](Discoveries-2/nailing-the-perfect-contrast.png)

Showing text on background images can be challenging due to contrast and readability. Yaphi has developed a solution to find always the right transparent overlay to show the most of the picture, but keep the text readable. Stunning...

## Contrast.js
by Misha Petrov : [https://github.com/MishaPetrov/Contrast.js](https://github.com/MishaPetrov/Contrast.js)

![Contrast.js](Discoveries-2/contrast-js.png)

Misha addresses the same problem as Yaphi, showing text on background images, but goes a different way with his library, which is trying to find the best constrasting text color, even if the page is responsive.
