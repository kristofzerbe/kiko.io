I don't often participate in the [IndieWeb Carnival](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival). The last thing I contributed was in November 2024 with my post [You will never know whose butterfly you were](/post/You-will-never-know-whose-butterfly-you-were/) on the topic of "Impact." Maybe I should do it more often, because it's really exciting to read other people's posts on the same topic. Different opinions offer new perspectives.

This month's topic from [Jeremiah](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/) really triggered me this time, and I've been thinking about it for days... [**The Meaning of Life**](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/2026-01-indieweb-carnival/) ... and here are my two cents on the matter.

<!-- more -->

What a topic, especially for a 57-year-old like me, who hardly has any days left where my body isn't acting up somewhere and drawing attention to its gradual decline. To the young people out there: enjoy every day while it's still not like that, because the day will come when the tide turns and you'll ask yourselves, *'how did I do that before?'*

It is probably no coincidence that this question is often asked at an advanced age. By then, you have already come a long way, reflect on it, and wonder what else might come and why you do certain things in the first place. Not everyone has this ability to reflect, because it is closely related to doubt, and some of us are not capable of doubting, or only to a limited extent. This is often found in politics and executive floors. Or among psychopaths. Hmm... anyway.

Without doubt or reflection, the question of the true meaning, the deeper meaning of life, beyond profane things like money and power, does not arise at all. And when these thoughts do occur to such people, it is usually very late in life, and they realize the damage they have caused to those around them because of their lack of doubt.

What if the quest for the meaning of life must remain unsuccessful even for doubting people because it simply does not exist? What if life is... and I say this without any judgment... "meaningless"?

If the question of the meaning of life arises from doubt, one must ask whether doubt is something good and useful. In most cultures, it has negative connotations, and not without reason. Doubt can be paralyzing when it takes over, and from an evolutionary perspective, that has always been a bad idea.

I wish every day that I had the serenity not to get upset or distressed about things I can't change anyway. In other words, to doubt less or even despair less, and to take occurrences as they come without wasting my energy wishing they were other than they are. To achieve this state is my ultimate goal. I often think of a short video I saw years ago of an Indian man who said in his beautiful accent  something like:

> Some days are fucked and cannot be unfucked ... Go home, sleep and try again tomorrow

That is a healthy and desirable attitude toward life's adversities. Without a doubt.

For me, the question about the meaning of life has another aspect that I can't quite get my head around. It sounds like a goal that you can or should achieve. If I do this or that, then I'll get a little closer to the meaning of my life? That contradicts my feeling. What's more, this idea contains a close relative of meaning: Purpose. So you could also ask, *"What is the purpose of my life?"* and that feels depressing even as I write it.

The answer to the question *"What is my goal in life?"* is much easier to come up with. As I did in the paragraph above, this can usually be expressed clearly. The problem here, however, is that this definition of a goal can only be an expression of the present, because if one thing is certain, it is change, and that also affects goals that have once been set.

Some folks answer this question with something like "Being a good human being." While this may seem timeless at first, even if you can't be sure that you won't turn into a dickhead in a few years, it generally comes with the problem of perspective. To whom am I a good person, who sees me that way, and are there people who judge my behavior completely different? An angel to one person, a devil to another. At first, you can only go by your own perspective, which is strongly influenced by the culture you live in.

I recently met up with a friend for a few drinks, and after the second or third glass of Guinness, we got onto the topic of religion. He is a trained and devout Catholic, and I have always been an atheist, also trained, but from a negative perspective. His approach is that his faith gives him structure, especially in matters over which he is powerless or which he cannot explain, à la *"It is God's will"*. I, on the other hand, have no third person in my head to whom I can pass things on, but I have to accept them as well. The difference between my friend and me is therefore only that I have no projection surface, which does not always make my life easier, as I can well understand how comforting such a figure can be in difficult times. But just as I do not need answers from a God, I also do not need an answer to the question of the meaning of life.

The question itself has religious connotations for me to a certain extent. This can be seen, for example, in the enduring popularity of the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, the Way of St. James. Its original destination is a prayer at the tomb of St. James, and since 830 AD, people from all parts of Europe have been walking there. The fact that so many people still undertake the weeks-long walk and the hardships involved, even today, when religiosity is on the decline, shows the real purpose of the journey: The journey itself. There are many reports of people setting off in pairs or threes, but eventually going their separate ways, not only because they have different walking speeds, but above all because people on the trail are preoccupied with themselves, their past, their future, their goals, desires, and fears. The brain begins to work, there are hardly any relevant distractions, and so you can find yourself. In the end, the actual geographical destination in northern Spain often plays only a minor role. The Camino itself, i.e., the path, and thus your own self, is the real goal.

Many words in these lines deal with movement and direction, and I think that is exactly what can and should replace the question of the meaning of life: What is my path in life? I am born and I am here. I start walking, make decisions that influence the direction of my path, and continue to do so until my strength wanes and I am no longer here.

> It is our being that defines us, and nothing more. There is no deeper meaning behind it.

Our human ability to think about it and seek to understand it sometimes prevents us from making the next right decision for our current path.
