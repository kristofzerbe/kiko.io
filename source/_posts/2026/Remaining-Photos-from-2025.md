Every now and then, when my sweetheart and I go on a day trip in the region, I sling my camera over my shoulder in the hope of capturing a beautiful scene or two. Last year was no exception. Often, however, I don't get around to reviewing and editing the photos, but I have now caught up on three events from 2025. Enjoy...

## Roman Festival, Wiesbaden @ 2025-09-13

The history of my hometown Wiesbaden dates back to Roman times, when they used the hot springs for relaxation. The city organised a small festival in honour of the Romans in 2025, including a show with birds of prey. Whatever the birds had to do with the Romans, they were still the most interesting thing.

## Opel Zoo, Kronberg @ 2025-06-21

A few kilometres away from our home, in Kronberg im Taunus, lies Opel Zoo, the second largest scientifically managed zoological garden in the Rhine-Main area. It was founded in 1956 by the grandson of car manufacturer Adam Opel and remains privately owned to this day. Every schoolchild in the area has to visit it at least once. In my case, however, it took nearly 57 years. The absolute star in the zoo was Kaja, the newborn baby elephant.

## Knights' Tournaments and Easter Market, Loreley @ 2025-04-20

Medieval markets are no longer as popular in Germany as they were 10 years ago, but the annual market held at the Loreley in spring still attracts thousands of visitors, perhaps due to the jousting tournaments that take place there.
