{% match_grid "_DEN_Dansk-Boldspil-Union" "1:1" "_ENG_England-Football-Association" %}

It's not often that you have a major football tournament on your doorstep. Of course, last autumn I registered for the first round of the auctions for tickets for the games at Frankfurt's Waldstadion ... and in fact won four tickets for each of two games, one preliminary round and one round of 16. In retrospect, with 2.7 million tickets available and 50 million applications, this can be seen as a stroke of luck, although at the time I didn't even know which teams I would get to see. No matter ... once or twice that European Championship feeling. Cool!

The preliminary round match took place yesterday evening: **Denmark** vs **England**. On paper, not a footballing sensation, especially as England had been rather disappointing in the first match of the preliminary round for a proclaimed favourite and the Danes had only started the competition with a draw ... But it's the European Championship and there's usually a lot at stake in the second game.

UEFA's ticket organisation can only be described as exemplary, even if EVERYTHING had to be handled online via apps and programming errors can sometimes creep in or breakdowns occur. Not here. Really good people thought about the functions, the UI and the menu navigation of the app and the process on match day in advance and so everything worked amazingly smoothly, from the fan pass for public transport to arrival at the stadium and admission. Also thanks to the numerous green-clad helpers who stood around everywhere and whom you could ask things at any time. Only ... the stadium sausage was a bit soggy.

The atmosphere in the arena was really impressive. Not as great as at a Frankfurt Eintracht league match, as there is no grandstand at the European Championships and therefore no wall of fans, but there were plenty of cheerful and vociferous Danes and English who sang their national anthems with fervour, and everyone else in between who let themselves be caught up in it.

## The Game

My expectations of the star-studded England team were already high. Bellingham, Kane, Foden, Rice, Saka, Alexander-Arnold are really good footballers with salaries beyond the pale. With the Danes, I knew Eriksen of course, the man with the inbuilt defibrillator, as well as Wind, Schmeichel and Vestergaard, but with the rest it was difficult. However, we soon realised that Denmark had a team on the pitch and England were playing with individual stars. Some wanted to, but couldn't and others could, but didn't want to.

The first goal was scored by **Harry Kane** to make it **1-0** when a Danish defender in his own penalty area overlooked Kyle Walker rushing in from behind, who took the ball from him, crossed in front of goal and Kane only had to put his foot down. After that, the English disappeared back into their defence and allowed the Danes to play their football. Refreshingly, it was Kane who played an inaccurate pass and Kristiansen was able to grab the ball, which ended up with **Hjulmand**, who hammered the ball into the net from 25 metres ... **1-1**.

Superstar Jude Bellingham was only on show when he fell to the turf and was seated, claiming a foul while play continued. Phil Foden provided a little more action, even hitting the post, but overall my sympathies were completely with the battling Danes, who appeared in front of the English goal again and again but were always thwarted by the English defence. Unfortunately, the player substitutions on both sides didn't shift the balance of power either. England were lame and Denmark self-sacrificing and so one side lost 2 points for the win and the other gained 1 point for the final draw. As the English Guardian wrote today:

## Overtime - Thank you for traveling with Deutsche Bahn

However, the real thrill only began after the game. Amidst thousands of mainly English fans, we made our way back to the S-Bahn (Dear UEFA: not SBAHN as on your signs. Even I had to think for a moment). Most of them turned off in the station tunnel onto the platform towards Frankfurt, but many wanted to go in the other direction, to the airport or on to Mainz or Wiesbaden, like us. There was even a train there and the display board on the platform read WIESBADEN. The displays on the carriages, however, read FRANKFURT. What now? In, out? And again and again different statements from the few staff, amidst sweating, drunken English fans, some of whom were relieving themselves in beer bottles. 

![](PXL_20240620_183004703.jpg)

After 15 minutes of crowding, the display changed to PLEASE GET OUT. Wtf? Some more staff in yellow high-visibility waistcoats and additional police arrived to clear the train. No announcement, nothing. One of the yellow vests then shouted at the top of his voice in German "THE TRAIN IS BROKEN, THE TRAIN IS BROKEN", but it took another 20 minutes for the last Englishman to understand what was going on. And still no announcements, no information when the broken train left the station!

A few minutes later, a new train arrived and filled up so quickly that the doors barely closed. We decided to wait for the next one. It arrived quite quickly, but only had the destination MAINZ, so it didn't go all the way to Wiesbaden. No matter, we took it anyway. The main thing was to get away from this platform.

We were finally travelling and discussing how we were going to get home from Mainz when an announcement came on that the train would end in RÃ¼sselsheim, but that it would be possible to continue on to Wiesbaden at platform 1 two minutes later. Wtf ... but okay. Everyone got off the train again, squeezed through a pedestrian tunnel and waited at platform 1, where after 10 minutes there was a terribly quiet announcement that the train would be delayed by 50 minutes for "official reasons". FIFTY MINUTES?

We gave up. Together with a friendly Englishman who had suffered the same fate and just wanted to get to his home in Wiesbaden somehow, we got into a taxi, whose driver was clearly delighted with the 60 euro fare.

## Conclusion

It was a great and surprisingly uncomplicated experience at the beginning, even if I had hoped for more from the game and the famous English fan chants. But what the thoroughly ailing Deutsche Bahn had delivered again was simply disgraceful. A public transport system, financed by billions of taxpayers' money, whose banner reads "GO F*** YOURSELF" in large letters, and none of the socially and mentally challenged top managers or the responsible ministers need fear any consequences. I only feel sorry for the employees who suffer the anger and hardly dare to say where they work in their private lives. It's really pathetic, but unfortunately nothing new.

Let's see what it will be like in 10 days' time for the round of 16 match and where we'll have to travel by train again. The game doesn't kick off until 9pm and if it goes into extra time, including a penalty shoot-out, it could be a short night ... but that's the price of being a football fan :)
