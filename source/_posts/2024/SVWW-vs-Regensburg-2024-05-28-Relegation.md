{% match_grid "SV-Wehen-Wiesbaden" "1:2" "Jahn-Regensburg" %}

As good as the first half of the season was for our team, the second half was just as bad. We lost our last 11 games and only thanks to the even worse performance of **Hansa Rostock** were we not relegated straight back to the 3rd Bundesliga, but ended up in the relegation places.

Last week was the first leg of this relegation play-off against last year's relegated team: **SSV Jahn Regensburg** ... and we actually managed to get a draw away from home: **2:2**. A starting position that could have been better, but what the hell. We just had to win the second leg in Wiesbaden in front of our own fans ... and of course I got myself a ticket. I had to, because my season ticket wasn't valid for the relegation play-off, but the club offered all season ticket holders their seats free of charge and sold the rest of the seats on. The stadium was accordingly full: 11,008 spectators. There were completely different people sitting next to me, because not all of the regular spectators had made use of the option. Bärbel, usually my moral support, was on holiday and kept her fingers crossed from afar.

Relegation matches in the Bundesliga are always evening games so that they can be broadcast at prime time on German television. Kick-off was at 8.30pm and the presence of several dozen police officers around the stadium and the very small number of visiting fans from Regensburg was remarkable. They were allocated just 25 % of the usual guest stand and sat crowded but loudly in one corner of the arena.

## The Game

Both teams started cautiously. You could feel that they had something to lose. Whoever won the game here and now would play in the Bundesliga 2 next season. Interestingly, our team started with almost the same line-up as they had left the pitch in Regensburg after some initial difficulties and a few substitutions, which then led to two goals. So **Sascha Mockenhaupt**, **Lasse Günther** and **Hyunju Lee** were on the pitch at the start.

What I liked about our team was that they combined well on the pitch again after a long time and the mistake rate was initially low. The tackles were also much better than in the last few games. I had the impression that the new coach **Nils Döring** had managed to get his boys mentally back on track. Regensburg, on the other hand, initially stood back and let Wiesbaden play. The only problem in the first half hour was that our game was almost exclusively played somewhere in midfield. Nice to watch, but the ball had to go into the box, towards the goal! We created a few chances, but none of them were really compelling. **Ivan Prtajin** managed to finish once or twice, but mostly missed the goal. It was a good idea, that this time the fast right winger Thijmen Goppel shared the right flank with the midfielder Robin Heußer and presented the opposition with some tricky challenges. The defence also worked quite well. From my point of view, **Marcus Mathisen** did a great job again this time.

Shortly before the end of the first half, our team's good but somewhat cautious style of play took its revenge, as they were unable to prevent Regensburg from scoring the goal in the 2 minute of extra time to make it **1:0** thanks to a well-executed counter-attack ... :| Going into the break with such a setback is difficult.

After the break, the referee's big moment came when he denied us our first penalty in the 46th minute after **Ivan Prtajin** was roughly sent to the ground in the penalty area. The stupid thing was that Regensburg didn't wait for a whistle while our boys were still complaining, but marched straight forward and scored to make it **2:0**.

This two-goal deficit was clearly noticeable in the next 20 minutes. We made mistakes and the game became a little choppy. Our coach made a few substitutions and with these new players we were able to increase the pressure. It became a game towards one goal, that of Regensburg, and it got wilder with every minute. The ball flew into the penalty area every second and the visitors defended bravely, but were unable to prevent **Ivan Prtajin**'s header in the 81st minute to make it **1:2**.

In the final phase of the game, there was another upset due to a penalty not being awarded and one or two great chances for us, but the f*** ball just wouldn't go in! After 90 + 7 minutes, the referee blew the final whistle and there was great jubilation in the small corner of the stadium: Regensburg had made it into the 2. Bundesliga again and Wehen-Wiesbaden had been relegated after just one year. The frustration of the players and fans was correspondingly great. **Aleksandar Vukotic**, our giant defender, lay on the pitch in tears for several minutes and we all felt something similar.

## Conclusion

It's such a shame, but I'm going to buy a season ticket for the Brita-Arena next season and watch games against **Alemannia Aachen**, **Dynamo Dresden**, **1860 Munich**, **Waldhof Mannheim** or **Borussia Dortmund II**. Maybe then there will be more to cheer about, because losing 12 games in a row shows that we are simply not fit for the 2nd Bundesliga.

The news from today, in which the club announced which players will be leaving us after this season, shows that this will also be difficult:

* Robin Heußer
* Kianz Froese
* John Iredale
* Lasse Günther
* Hyun-ju Lee
* Keanan Bennetts
* Julius Kade

Ivan Prtajin also seems to have some good offers from 1st and 2nd division clubs and will be hard to keep. The hottest rumour is a move to my favourite club from my youth, HSV.

I will miss Heußer, Lee and Iredale in particular, because they always brought life to the show. But whatever the squad looks like at the start of the new season in late summer, I'll be there to celebrate the next promotion.
