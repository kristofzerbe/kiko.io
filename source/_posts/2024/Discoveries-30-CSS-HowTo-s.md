You don&#39;t have to use threejs to create stunning visual effects in your browser. CSS is all you need if you know how to do it. Rob knows how and even creates hologram-like effects with &#39;mix-blend-mode&#39;.

Adam again, this time in a guest article for Codrops. This time he shows us how to use CSS-only Scroll-Driven Animations, which are not yet supported by all browsers, but have at least been available as a W3C draft since the beginning of 2024. Amazing stuff â€¦

Another post from Josh. This time he shows us how to use CSS transitions in a comprehensive guide! These form a big part of the magic using microinteractions and other animations.

{% discovery "Understanding Clip Path in CSS" "Ahmad Shadeed" "https://ishadeed.com/article/clip-path/" Discoveries-30-CSS-HowTo-s understanding-clip-path-in-css.png %}
Clip-Path is a CSS concept that is probably one of the most difficult to understand and internalise next to animations. Ahmad does his best to explain the feature to us in detail ... (I have to read it again in a couple of month)

{% discovery "Hello, CSS Cascade Layers" "Ahmad Shadeed" "https://ishadeed.com/article/cascade-layers/" Discoveries-30-CSS-HowTo-s hello-css-cascade-layers.png %}
The &#39;C&#39; in CSS means &#39;Cascading&#39; and describes the fact that written rules have a specificity, initially depending on where they are in the code.
