When I read about the topic of the current [IndieWeb Carnival](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival), which is being organized this time by [Alexandra](https://library.xandra.cc/) and in which I am participating for the first time... **[Impact](https://library.xandra.cc/indieweb-carnival/)**... my first and so far only thought about it was: **People**. The ones that cross your path in the course of your life and, whether intentionally or unintentionally, send you in a different direction like a pinball in a game machine.

<!-- more -->

You may think that you have decided on certain changes of direction in your life all by yourself and without outside influence, but that is basically a misleading assumption, because your decision was preceded by conversations with or observations of other people who first pointed out a new path for you to follow, whether consciously or unconsciously.

Like all social beings, we act according to the principle of role modeling, and unfortunately in all directions. Good and bad, sensible and senseless, dangerous and harmless, or usually something in between. In addition, there is a kind of magnet effect: sometimes a role model repels us and sometimes it draws us in.

The problem, or rather the magic of it, is that the role model sometimes simply does not know what effect a sentence or an action has had on his counterpart. A bit like the [butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect). The little creature bravely beating its wings somewhere over the Brazilian Amazon has no idea and no intention that the breath of wind it creates will grow into a tornado thousands of kilometers further south in Texas, destroying houses.

Of course, this hypothetical example from chaos theory is somewhat drastic and has negative connotations, but in my own experience it works exactly the same way on an interpersonal level. With negative, but also with positive effects... and I would like to tell you about one of those.

At the end of the 80s, when I was in my early 20s and still a greenhorn, my father said that after I signed a training contract to become an industrial clerk, it would be time to shut the front door on me and slam it. As a final act of mercy, he had found me a courtyard room near my new workplace, which I now had to furnish just as much as my whole life. Filling one with furniture and the other with meaning.

Becoming an industrial clerk was an stopgap and my father's idea, because in his opinion I hadn't pursued the path to my dream job as a photographer stringently enough and it was all a useless art anyway. I gave in at some point and now I know that he just wanted to get rid of me.

I got my apprenticeship through an internship at the mini-mainframe manufacturer Prime Computer Inc., whose German distributor was based in my hometown of Wiesbaden. The plan was to channel me and another newbie through all the departments in two years (including a few weeks at the cooperation partner Schott Mainz, because Prime did not produce in Germany), accompanied by a not insignificant amount of vocational school days.

In one of these departments, the warehouse, I met my butterfly in the form of the warehouse manager and only employee so far down in the building: **Colin Urquhart**. I don't remember much about him, but I have very fond memories of him being the only person in the company who had somehow managed to get hold of one of the new x86 IBM computers, while all the other colleagues still had to sit in front of amber-colored monitors. I can still hear his voice with that distinct Scottish accent, how he not only taught me the secrets of warehousing, but also taught me the basic MS-DOS commands on this “PC” to help him improve the storage system.

He was by no means a father figure, but his friendliness and enthusiasm for the new technology were contagious. I remember him as a simply positive person who, unlike others, never looked down on me. I was Kristof and he was Colin, and together we discovered (I more than he) the magic of the new operating system from Redmond.

After my time in the warehouse came to an end, I moved on to sales and accounting, passed my exam successfully at some point, went to college, and simply didn't look back. Unfortunately, I don't know what happened to Colin, but what he sparked in me with his love of technology during those few weeks has lasted to this day. I continued to fiddle with PCs and DOS in my free time, discovered Windows 2.0 and 3.11, got hooked on the Access 1.0 database hype, became a tutor for Access at the university of applied sciences (because the professor only knew and could use DBase), got my first programming jobs for Access databases, left school because I had too many jobs... and today I am the IT manager of a 34-person team of great IT people.

I am sure that Colin quickly forgot our time together in the warehouse, not to mention what he triggered in me, but my memory of it shows me again and again and very clearly that it doesn't take much to change a person's life. A smile at the right time in the right place is enough. Everyone should be aware at all times that they can be the impetus, the butterfly for something positive in someone else's life.
