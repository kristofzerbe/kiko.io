{% match_grid "SV-Wehen-Wiesbaden" "1:2" "SC-Paderborn" %}

Matchday ... and another evening game and this time against **SC Paderborn**, who had to endure quite a debacle (4:0) against Kiel last week, but are still knocking at the top of the table. 

This time I also got some extra tickets for friends and my wife, because one of them is from Paderborn and has been following his team for years and had no problem travelling 3 hours there and 3 hours back just for one game. My wife comes from the Sauerland region and Paderborn is not far away, so she felt a bit of sympathy for the SC, even though she now lives in Wiesbaden. The other two are actually Eintracht fans and know the Waldstadion with its 58,000 seats and wanted to see the cosy atmosphere of the Brita-Arena.

The meeting point was 90 minutes before kick-off at the railway station. There was enough time to delay the boys' arrival, take a short walk to the stadium (about a kilometre) and enjoy a stadium sausage or two. My wife and I had decided to take the bus for the sake of convenience. We were on time and waiting for the others when I realised that instead of my smartphone, I had my wife's almost identical one in my pocket. F***! How were the others supposed to reach me if they were late or something else was wrong? I don't know how we survived without these mobile gadgets at the end of the nineties!? I felt amputated, blind and deaf. ME, without my smartphone ... that never happened before!

<!-- more -->

OK ... we had agreed an exact meeting point, but only one turned up. No sign of the other two. 15 minutes later, the second one showed up and said he had tried to reach me, but I hadn't answered the phone. Well, how could he? The phone was on the charger at home. But there was no sign of the last one. One of the others then managed to connect with him via Slack and it turned out that he had missed his second train because the first one was late. He asked why I wasn't answering the phone! 

Finally, after 40 minutes, we were all together and decided to take at least 1 taxi, as two of the boys were not good on foot. But there were five of us, so my wife said the two of us could walk. Ok, then. 10 minutes later, all five of us were standing in the queue in front of the stadium entrance when I realised that I had printed out the tickets for the other four, but not my season ticket, because it was stored digitally on ... my smartphone! F***!!

Of course there is NO taxi in front of the stadium before the start of the game, but only afterwards, and OF COURSE there wasn't one in sight that was unloading guests and so I had to run like a madman back to the train station to reveal my distress to a very friendly and football-interested taxi driver. 6pm and only 30 minutes to drive home through the city, grab my filthy phone and get back to the stadium.

What can I say ... not only was the guy okay, but he also dropped me off outside the stadium at exactly 6.25pm and I took my seat just as the SVWW kick-off music finished and the teams entered the pitch. I was done, but happy. A quick greeting to BÃ¤rbel and my friends 3 rows behind me and the game began...

## The Game

The game was rather unspectacular, although we had lost away at Schalke last week and Paderborn, as I said, had to take a real beating against Kiel, so both teams actually had to win. We started in front of only 6.300 spectators with a lot of pressure, but after 5 minutes the attack slowed down a bit because we made a lot of mistakes in defence and invited our opponents to play their game. You could clearly see the difference in ability between the two teams. Paderborn's players were much more confident on the ball and the fans in the stands gave free rein to their displeasure. They simply played carelessly.

Wiesbaden repeatedly managed to shift the game into the opponent's half through high pressing, but individual mistakes meant that the opponents were always very quick in front of our goal. Two or three precise passes and our goalkeeper **Stritzel** had work to do. It was all the more astonishing that a really good and fast ball relay led to **1:0 for SVWW** in the 31st minute. **Franco Kovacevic** ...Yessss!

But the pattern remained. A sprint and a one-two pass from Paderborn and our defence was outplayed. It was far too easy and so it came as it had to: **1:1** just 8 minutes later .. :|

Unfortunately, the picture hadn't really changed after half-time and we were simply lucky that a ball from the visitors hit the crossbar in the 47th minute and another only the post in the 51st.

The coach decided to use his entire contingent of substitutes and so **Goppel** and **Lee** came on in the 59th minute, **Agrafiotis** and **Iredale** in the 74th and last but not least **Rieble** in the 83rd minute. But even if that helped a little, Paderborn scored the winning goal in the 83rd minute to make it **1:2**.

After that it was a game to one goal, because Wiesbaden tried everything to at least equalise and they fought really passionately, but just a little too late and too imprecise.

## Conclusion

Even though our team only played a good game from time to time over the entire 90 minutes, it was noticeable that the referee's performance was even worse. As soon as a Paderborn player fell to the ground, a free-kick was whistled, but if one of our players was chopped down, he allowed the game to go on. He also didn't seem to care if the Paderborn players used their hands in the penalty area or if a particularly hot-headed player from the visitors got violent, in which case both players received a yellow card.

The only good thing about this match day was that the teams in the basement of the league couldn't win either and I have something to talk about because of my odyssey before the match.
