{% match_grid "SV-Wehen-Wiesbaden" "3:5" "Greuther-Fuerth" %}

Sunday's home game against Fürth was the highest scoring and also my last of the season. What a spectacle and rollercoaster of emotions! I don't think I've ever been so loud or so quiet in a game. The boys really got on my nerves.

There's not much to report from the run-up to the game. Bärbel was there too, of course, and we were simply looking forward to maybe taking one or even three points against Fürth, who are in eighth place in the league, because they have no chance of going up and no problem at the bottom. The hope was that Fürth would take it easy and we'd get the chance to put some distance between ourselves and the relegation places before the last three games against Braunschweig and the No. 1 and 2 teams in the league, Kiel and St. Pauli.

## The Game

The coach's line-up was unusually offensive. He had put **Prtajin** and **Agrafiotis** in attack and **Iredale** on the right, who is usually substituted for Prtajin in the second half. On the left, **Bennetts** was allowed to start from the beginning. Oooh ... that smelled of excitement ... and the fans were not disappointed! The players got off to a flying start and after just 3 minutes (!) Prtajin made it **1:0** ... \o/

The defense worked intensively, but also a bit hectic, due to the somewhat poorer tackling strength of our boys. This was also noticed by the referee, who received an uncontrolled defensive volley to the head in the 13th minute and had to shake himself briefly. In the forwards, however, Wiesbaden remained ice-cold. The Fürth goalkeeper
played a somewhat unfortunate pass in his own penalty area, which Agrafiotis intercepted directly and made it **2:0** after 17 minutes! Woah ... keep it up!

But Fürth were not going to go down easily, not least because they played the better, more controlled football. They got their chances and after our goalkeeper **Stritzel** thwarted a huge opportunity in the 26th minute, the **2:1** was scored on the follow-up shot. It wasn't going to be that easy after all.

Things got strange after half an hour: the linesman interrupted the game due to a large hole in the grass on the touchline and while the groundsman ran off to get equipment, the referee tried to plug the hole somehow. The first big upset came when play resumed, as Wiesbaden increased the lead to 3:1 through Angha after a free-kick from Bennetts ... \o/ ... but the goal was disallowed for offside ... /o\. Almost immediately on the counter-attack, Fürth now found it too easy to get through our defence and scored to equalise at **2:2** and only 5 minutes later after a corner to **2:3**. The "hurrah" had now given way to great uncertainty.

After half-time, our players seemed a little more settled and things went a little more smoothly forwards again, which resulted in two or three good chances, but unfortunately nothing worthwhile. It was really only SVWW playing and Fürth seemed to want to manage the result. They sometimes stayed on the ground a little longer or took a minute to kick off. We played and they had us reasonably under control.

In the 65th minute, **Vucotic** pulled an attacker off his feet in the box and a penalty was awarded, which the Fürth captain kicked into the sky, much to the delight of the fans. Nevertheless, Fürth's delaying tactics continued and a player who had just come on as a substitute was consequently shown a yellow card in the 68th minute. He was briefly upset about this, ran back into his defence and spooned an approaching ball out of the danger zone with his arm ... Penalty for Wiesbaden! **Prtajin** was not to be denied the **3:3** and the Fürth coach immediately took the poor bastard off the pitch.

The drama that followed was hard to beat. Wiesbaden wanted and had to win the game at all costs and so our tall defender **Vukotic** appeared several times in the opposing penalty area to head one of the long balls into the net, but he was now missing at the back and in one or two situations our goalkeeper was the only one left standing in our half of the pitch. Two quick counter-attacks by Fürth then unfortunately led to **3:4** and **3:5**.

## Conclusion

You can't say they didn't fight, but at times it was a bit headless and so it wasn't really surprising that the club sacked our coach **Kauczinski** after what was probably an entertaining but dramatic loss for the spectators. Losing another 4 games in a row was probably one too many. His former assistant coach **Döring** now has the pleasure of preventing relegation against Braunschweig, Kiel and St Pauli. I'm keeping all my fingers crossed and will most certainly be there next season ...
