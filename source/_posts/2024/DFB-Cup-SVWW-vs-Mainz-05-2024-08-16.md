{% match_grid "SV-Wehen-Wiesbaden" "1:3" "Mainz-05" %}

The two state capitals of Wiesbaden (Hesse) and Mainz (Rhineland-Palatinate) have a very special relationship with each other. Not only are they the only state capitals in Germany (Europe? The World?!) that are directly opposite each other (separated only by the Rhine), but there has been regular trouble since 1945 over three districts that may well bear the name ‘Mainz’, but were simply assigned to Wiesbaden by the Americans after the war... which the people of Mainz did not find particularly funny, as the city is a whopping 2,000 years older and, for reasons of space, had moved its industry to the other side of the Rhine at some point.

The people on both sides of the Rhine take the long-standing rivalry with a sense of humour and tease each other about it. What is the best thing about Mainz? The number 6 bus to Wiesbaden :D

In terms of football, I had hoped that my SVWW would stay in the 2. Bundesliga last season and that Mainz would be relegated, and for a long time it looked like that would be the case. In the end, however, it was the other way around and now the two clubs are separated by an entire league. It's a shame to have missed the opportunity to play in the same league.

I was all the more thrilled after the draw for the first round of the German Cup: WIESBADEN against MAINZ! Ha! So at least ONE game against each other this year. I was perfectly aware that this game would be sold out and as a season ticket holder I was entitled to my seat and another 6 tickets in advance. But for some reason I had missed the start of ticket sales and a few days later, when I finally remembered, only THREE of the 12,500 tickets were left in the entire stadium! After that, only two, but I had to apologise to some people I had told that I would see if I could get tickets for them in my block.

The game kicked off yesterday evening at 6pm and, as expected, there was a lot going on. The Mainz team (and their fans), whose club colours are red and white, had decided to wear white, and we played in our traditional red. This made it easy to tell the two groups apart. Because of my ticket faux pas, I found myself sitting in the middle of a sea of white with my red shirt, but as I said, the people of Wiesbaden and Mainz like each other in their hearts.

## The Game

Mainz 05 wanted to make it clear from the beginning who the first division team was and pressed from the first minute. Our goalkeeper had already had to punch two balls into the stands by the 10th minute, but we were slowly waking up in attack too. So awake that **Tarik Gözüsirin** was able to put us 1-0 up in the 14th minute with the first noteworthy attack! Yeah!

Since the opponent was now playing a little more cautiously, both teams played at eye level and it became a really good game. Of course, Mainz came back into the game a short time later, but our defence did a good job, especially **Florian Carstens**, who was rewarded with a few moments of applause. When he couldn't save it, our **Florian Stritzel** was still standing like a wall in goal.

Despite a break for drinks due to the high temperatures on the pitch, after 40 minutes you could see that the Wiesbaden team was running out of steam. An attack by **Fabian Greilinger** on the left side was hardly followed by anyone else, and so there was no one to take the subsequent cross. **Moritz Flotho** in the front line could not do it on his own. But when a few more players ran forward, it immediately became dangerous again. In the 45th minute, the Mainz goalkeeper only just managed to prevent the 2:0 against the wonderfully placed header from Flotho after a cross from **Thijmen Goppel**. Well done! Go boys, send Mainz into the break with a 2-goal deficit.

After the break, both teams were fully alert and an open and fast game developed, which the fans enjoyed a lot. It was not until the 59th minute that Mainz had a real chance to score, which they unfortunately used to make it 1:1.

What our coach will have to work on with his boys in the next few weeks is standards. As in the last game, free kicks and corners posed no danger today. The lack of determination in front of goal is also a shortcoming. Antonio Jonjic, who came on for Flotho, moves into the opposing penalty area wonderfully quickly and straightforwardly, only to push the ball from left to right and then lose it at the end. 

From the 75th minute, Mainz tried to shift the game completely into our half, but failed repeatedly against our defence and then had to run after the ball afterwards. And that's how it stayed until the end of the game. Extra time! 2 x 15 minutes.

The game didn't change in the extra time either: as quickly as the balls were won, they were lost again... on both sides. Mainz 05 seemed somewhat frustrated (and that's the best reason to go to the stadium ;)

Unfortunately, it all ended as it had to: in the 113th minute, Carstens was a step too slow on the right side of Mainz's counterattack and could only tackle the ball uncontrolled into the centre, where another player gratefully converted it to 1:2. DAMN! Of course, SVWW now had to throw everything forward to at least get to the penalty shootout, but that's exactly what gave the opponent the space for the third and final goal in the 120th minute.

## Conclusion

A nail-biting game in the cup derby with our rivals from across the Rhine, and it was great to see that we were able to keep up with them for such a long time. After all, Mainz 05 is playing against Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund this season, while we are playing against Verl, Cottbus and Unterhaching. As they say, the cup has its own rules, but not for us this time. But let's see where we and Mainz are next year in early summer. Maybe then my dream of a season in the same league will come true.
