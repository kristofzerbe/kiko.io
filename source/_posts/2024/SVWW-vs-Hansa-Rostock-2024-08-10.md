Okay, so here we go for the new league season, this time a class lower again, after we were relegated from the 2nd Bundesliga last season after just one year.

Bärbel is no longer on board and I'm now sitting in W2, row 6, so a bit higher up and more on the halfway line. This can help with the overview. The first thing I did after arriving at the stadium was to buy the new jersey for the 24/25 season. I think I'll make a tradition out of it. It's just a shame that I can't find the shirt from my first partial season 22/23 anywhere. That was my favourite so far ... black with red stripes.

The team has changed a lot. Many of the 2nd division players have moved on to stay in the division or, like Prtajin, are now even playing in the 1.  Bundesliga. I haven't seen most of the new ones yet, except for a few three weeks ago in a friendly against FC Metz, which was lost 0:2.

Last week, SVWW were away at Verl in the season opener and just managed to salvage a draw agains **Verl**: 2:2. Today, in their first home game, they face **Hansa Rostock** and hopefully the noticeable uncertainty of the last few months can be put to bed. Of course in front of a much smaller crowd (only 5,200 spectators), because we are no longer in the 2nd division. The fans definitely want to win, especially as no other club has scored more goals in this division since it was founded.

Let's see what happens this season ... hopefully direct re-promotion.

## The Game

FC Hansa Rostock, who also have plenty of Bundesliga experience but were relegated to the 3rd division with SVWW last season, left no doubt that they wanted to win the game and their supporters made their usual loud statement.

In the first few minutes, it was a lively back-and-forth, but without one team making a compelling appearance in front of goal, apart from one scene in the Hansa penalty area where several of our players were able to shoot at goal from some distance, but there was always a Rostock leg in the way.

I really liked the new midfield strategist **Tarik Gözüsirin**, who not only directed his team-mates with a good overview, but also managed to distribute the ball well. Our goalkeeper **Florian Stritzel** was also good as usual, saving us from going behind for the first time in the 14th minute. In my opinion, our team played well, but all too often the opponents got behind the defence far too easily and the flanks didn't reach our new striker Moritz Flotho. Only **Thijmen Goppel** created a highlight in the 18th minute when he placed the ball well in the bottom right-hand corner of the goal, but the Hansa goalkeeper was able to get his fingertips to it.

After just under half an hour, there was the first drink break, because it was very hot at almost 30 degrees Celsius, and although you could tell that our team had been reassembled and some of the coordination was not yet working, but they played better than at the end of last season. This was also the case in the 21st minute, which actually led to the 1:0 through **Moritz Flotho**! Yessss ... !

Shortly afterwards, things got strange: one of our defenders was overrun by a Rostock player on the left and our goalkeeper had no choice but to come out of his goal to try to clear the ball. However, the opponent simply lobbed the ball long over him from 20 metres towards the now empty goal ... and only hit the far post! The poor bloke will be suffering from that for some time.

Just before half-time, Hansa generally became more dangerous, but were often thwarted by defenders such as Florian Carstens, who had a great game, or by the goalkeeper.

In the second half, the spectators had to endure a rather disjointed game that offered hardly any solutions or highlights. Whenever a Hansa player got away from the defence, like in the 58th minute, it was Stritzel who made up for the mistake. But we didn't do any better. A free-kick in the 59th minute from a very good position turned into a corner, which turned into a free-throw, which turned into nothing.

In the 63rd minute, it looked as if we would be able to use a good attack into the opponent's penalty area to make it 2-0, but it turned into a wild scramble because Rostock couldn't get the ball away and we couldn't get it into the goal. Even a decent move on our part in the 83rd minute showed a clear lack of quality, because as quickly as the ball was played forward, it was quickly played back to our own goalkeeper. SVWW didn't want to risk anything, which often backfires. But not today. You could tell that the 22 men on the pitch were simply exhausted due to the heat and the referee finally blew the whistle after 5 minutes of injury time (after he personally helped one of our players with a leg cramp) ... and we had our first home win since January!

## Conclusion

A total of 8 new players were on the pitch and it will take a while for one or two of them to be able to pronounce their names without any accidents, but the performance gives us hope that our coach will be able to form a real team from this bunch of old and new players.
