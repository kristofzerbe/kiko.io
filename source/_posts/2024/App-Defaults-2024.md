Meanwhile, I also have a detailed and updated list of all the things I absolutely need as a slash page under [**/USES**](/uses), but here is a brief summary of my current app defaults for this year:

## Changes

The biggest changes in my information management have come from [adopting Obsidian](/post/My-Switch-to-Obsidian) and the [Johnny Decimal System](/post/Johnny-Decimal-Emerging-from-the-Abyss) this year. **Obsidian**, in particular, has replaced many other tools. I currently only need Trello for a few things that I haven't had time to move yet.

For security, I replaced the many Passkey applications from the major providers with the damn good open-source solution **2FAS** and I'm really happy with it.

[Cory Dransfeld](https://coryd.dev/)'s many music-related posts made me take a closer look at his preferred tool **Plexamp** ... and I was thrilled! All I had to do was add my music collection to my already existing Plex server and I was done. No more cumbersome syncs on my Android phone.

For sporadically changing code from my smartphone, e.g. to administer my blog, I relied on gitpod.io for a while, but they not only changed their entire technology but also the availability and so I switched to **github.dev** and **GitHub Codespaces**. It's a shame anyway that there is still no decent IDE or working implementation of VSCode for Android.
