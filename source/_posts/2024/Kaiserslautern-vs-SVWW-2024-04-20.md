{% match_grid "1-FC-Kaiserslautern" "1:1" "SV-Wehen-Wiesbaden" %}

It's weekend again and my SV Wehen-Wiesbaden, promoted to the 2nd Bundesliga last season, have to face a legendary German club: 1. FC Kaiserslautern, against whom we won 2:1 at home in the first half of the season. But now away, in Kaiserslautern, in the no less legendary Fritz Walter Stadium! And I'll be there this time ...

{% alertbox info %}
For all those who don't know who **Fritz Walter** was: As an FCK player, he was captain of the German national team in 1954, which became world champions for the first time against Hungary in Bern.  
A weather situation in Germany is even named after him: Fritz Walter weather means when it rains cats and dogs and you have to play football.
{% endalertbox %}

Fritz would have had his fun with the weather, at least some of the time: the sun and rain alternated on Saturday in typical April fashion. The meeting point for the away trip was at 09:30 at the Wiesbaden stadium. In addition to the obligatory buses of the Ultras and the fan clubs, the [26er Club](https://svww.de/26erclub) had also provided 2 buses and sold tickets to the club members, and since I will miss the last two home games in May due to my vacation and Kaiserslautern is only a 1-hour drive, I had to be there. A total of 9 buses were on the way to the second last away game of the season. Quite impressive for the rather fan-less SV Wehen-Wiesbaden. Now, I didn't know a soul, but it's easy to make friends among fans, helped by the fact that the average age of my bus was around 50, because the youngsters tend to tick differently. But fun was guaranteed in our "senior shuttle".

Another reason to come to the away game is the club's current situation: equal on points with Rostock on the relegation place and only 2 points ahead of FCK. The loser of this game will be fighting all the more for relegation and every fan is needed!

While our stadium is rather cozy with 12K spectators, the Fritz Walter Stadium, which has been expanded again and again over the decades, can accommodate almost 50K people ... and on Saturday there were over 42K spectators. A completely different atmosphere and the trip was worth it just for that. Unbelievable!

## The Game

Normally SVWW plays on foreign pitches in an (ugly) neon yellow jersey, but this time in all white with gold lettering on the back. Was that supposed to be a sign? At least it didn't seem to affect the players at the beginning. The game took place mainly in our half, but both teams didn't give each other any fights and were evenly matched in terms of mistakes. Thankfully, the once again strong Florian Stritzel** in the SVWW goal was able to clear a fatal pass back to the goalkeeper in the 13th minute. It wasn't until the 19th minute that things got dangerous for FCK for the first time, as one of our players could have shot just outside the box and relatively centrally, but instead slipped on the ball :/ Curiously, an FCK player appeared almost free in front of Stritzel on the counter-attack and the exact same thing happened to him :D

Less than 5 minutes later, our goalkeeper was on hand to deal with a long throw-in into the box, but Kaiserslautern wanted to take the lead and after a corner in the 30th minute, the ball bobbled into our net: **1:0**! The game was then briefly interrupted because the goalscorer not only hit the ball but also the skull of **Lasse Günther**. Ouch...

Things got a little wilder. Kaiserslautern almost made it 2:0 in the 34th minute, but SVWW fought passionately until the break, which resulted in one or two yellow cards but also scoring chances on both sides.

At the break, our coach took Günther out of the defense and sent another striker onto the pitch in the person of **Nikolas Agrafiotis**, who had remained very pale since his signing in January. That changed fundamentally in this match. He really raised the alarm up front and pulled the others along with him. It was now a completely different game with only one direction: the FCK goal. 

The fans' hearts stopped at times because the only thing preventing the tie were the limbs of the Lauterer goalkeeper. In the case of **Keanan Bennetts** in the 61st minute, the right foot. Shortly afterwards, fan favorite **Thijmen Goppel** was substituted for Bennetts and immediately generated further momentum down the left flank. However, it took until the 74th minute for the ball to finally hit the net from 25 meters, kicked by **Ivan Prtajin**. \o/ **1:1**!

SVWW continued to push forward, as **John Iredale** did in the 80th minute, but after a while they pulled back a little more and tried to counter-attack. At some point, it seemed as if the players were at least happy not to lose. And they weren't, because the referee blew the whistle after 7 minutes of overtime. Too bad ... more could have been possible.

## Conclusion

The one point certainly helps, but as I write this, Rostock, who previously had the same number of points, are playing Magdeburg and are fortunately 0:2 behind and will probably remain in the relegation place, but then only with this one point gap! A win is needed next weekend against Fürth so that I can sleep more peacefully. The life of a fan of a promoted team is really not for wimps...
