First of May is a bank holiday in Germany, this year it's in the middle of the week and it has 25 degrees Celsius. Fantastic! The light is a little hazy because there's a lot of Saharan dust in the air again, but what should Thomas care ... he's in the garden and I have the opportunity to keep him company with my latest acquisition: the **TAMRON SP 150-600mm F/5-6.3 Di VC USD G2**.

My heavens, that thing is a stovepipe! Thank goodness I thought of getting a monopod, because holding almost 3 kilograms steady in your hand is hardly possible, regardless of the image stabiliser. It looks a bit strange now, trudging through Thomas' densely overgrown garden like a sports photographer, but it's a lot of fun and I don't regret a cent at the moment. I need training on the device, because with a focal length like this, the handling I'm familiar with is completely different.

Have a nice holiday, take it easy and enjoy the weather ...
