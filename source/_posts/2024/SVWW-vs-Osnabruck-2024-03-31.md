{% match_grid "SV-Wehen-Wiesbaden" "0:1" "VfL-Osnabrueck" %}

Matchday in Wiesbaden! On Easter Sunday! I managed to convince my wife to drive home a little earlier from our visit to her mum so that I could get to the stadium on time and watch SV Wehen Wiesbaden pick up the all-important 3 points against bottom-placed Osnabrück. At least that was the plan...

We have a disappointing relationship with Osnabrück from last season, when we were in second place in the 3. Bundesliga and were overtaken by them shortly before the finish line and had to go into relegation instead of being promoted directly, so it was satisfying to have won the first match away from home last year. The second match now in our arena was supposed to follow the same pattern and Bärbel, myself and the other (only) 6,135 spectators were in good spirits. Except, of course, for the handful of opposing fans who had travelled from Osnabrück.

## The Game

However, what we saw from our team in the first half was more like a shy and unmotivated easter egg hunt, because Osnabrück tried to play football and we defended. Tried, because they didn't get much going and you could see why Osnabrück are last in the table of 2. Bundesliga. But we hardly got anything going forwards and when we did, the ball was gone again after two or three passes. Once again, we played as if we were afraid to win or lose. 

In the 35th minute, the fans could hardly believe their eyes: VfL's Conteh was passed the ball in his own half and made his way forwards, probably wondering why no Wiesbaden player was seriously attacking him. It looked like a walk through the Wiesbaden defence. A friendly wave and congratulations were all that was needed. The result was **0:1** for our opponents and pissed off fans. We'll keep the rest of the first half under a mantle of silence for now. It was frustrating.

Rarely has coach Kauczinski substituted players directly during the break. This time it was two of them. Tappertshofer and Carstens came on for Fechner and Mathisen and both of them, like the rest of the team at last, really turned up the heat. It became a really wild game and someone was constantly lying on the ground, usually an Osnabrück player, acting like a dying swan.

In the 54th minute, Kovacevic was just one step too late to make it 1:1 and in the 58th, Prtajin headed just narrowly over the target. Wiesbaden's attacks became increasingly ferocious and Osnabrück barely played any more, instead focussing on delaying the game, especially the goalkeeper, who was shown a yellow card shortly before the end.

In the 66th minute, the fans' heart rate rose above the bearable mark: After a beautiful pass into the opposing penalty area and the turmoil there, Vukotic headed in to make it 1:1, but once again an Osnabrück player rolled on the ground, dying ... and the referee cancelled out the goal due to an alleged striker foul! Unbelievable! The crowd was on the edge of their seats and the referees were being verbally abused from all sides.

The last 30 minutes were a game to one goal, our coaches made three more changes, but we couldn't get the ball into the net and Osnabrück became unsportsmanlike by delaying every action. In the 90th minute, a player was even sent off with a yellow/red card, but it didn't help. We lost the game 0:1 ... :|

## Conclusion

Where we needed a win to put some distance between us and the relegation places, we showed signs of nerves and are now in the midst of a relegation battle. 3 teams have 31 points and Kaiserlautern in the relegation place have only 2 points less. Curiously, we started the matchday in 13th place and, despite the defeat, ended up in 12th place because Magdeburg now have the poorer goal difference. 

Next week, it's almost all to play for away against second-last Rostock, because we then have to play third-placed Düsseldorf at home. So it will be a difficult end to the season, but hope dies last...
