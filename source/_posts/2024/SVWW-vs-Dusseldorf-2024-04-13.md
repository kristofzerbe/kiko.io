{% match_grid "SV-Wehen-Wiesbaden" "0:2" "Fortuna-Duesseldorf" %}

I still owe you the game from the weekend, in which most people probably had little expectation because it was at home against Fortuna Düsseldorf, who are currently in the relegation place for promotion to the 1st Bundesliga and are managing to keep HSV, my favourite club from my youth, at bay. Daniel Thioune, one of HSV's many former coaches, and his squad had something to lose and he will have set them up accordingly before the game.

Bärbel and I talked about season tickets for next season before the game and agreed that we would sit together again, albeit no longer directly in row 1, because as cool as it is to sit almost on the pitch, the view is sometimes suboptimal. We've agreed on row 3, even though she doesn't yet know whether she'll still be in it after a possible relegation to the 3rd division. I'm almost certain that I'll have a season ticket next season again. It's also fun to play against 1860 München, Dresden or Saarbrücken and maybe even a bit more, because we might be able to win more often at this level and it's more positive to play for promotion than against relegation. Let's see...

## The Game

It was nice to see that our boys played with more courage and energy in the first half than in the last three games, but the defence was a bit disorganised at times and Fortuna were mercilessly efficient. After 13 minutes it was already 0:1, although they let us play.

We also had a few chances to score, but the passing rate in our build-up play was simply not good enough for more. It felt like the bigger Fortuna were keeping the smaller SVWW at bay with their long arms while we were desperately trying to score. The attitude was right, but not the skill.

Things became even more difficult from the 34th minute onwards, when Lee over-motivatedly stepped on the feet of an opponent and was sent off with a red card. It wasn't just us fans who thought the decision was too hard, but also coach Kauczinski, who saw the yellow card while shouting loudly and with a red head. However, it was the referee who was responsible for the turmoil and the interruption to the game, who was harsh in his behaviour but not very confident. What the DFB let onto the pitch is sometimes terrifying.

SVWW walled themselves in for the last few minutes of the first half, but came back onto the pitch with courage and gave the impression that they wanted to turn the game around. Martin Angha in particular was on top of every one of his opponents and stomped away all of Fortuna's attempts on his side. Brilliant. But even he couldn't prevent the partial disorder in defence and so Düsseldorf managed to make it 0:2 after 20 minutes. DAMN!

Unfortunately, the game levelled off a little after further yellow cards for Vukotic and Prtajin and the chants of the Fortuna fans were more interesting than the game. Unfortunately, the substitutions of Catic, Carstens and Agrafiotis did little to change this. Even two good standards were not used and the shots went wide over the goal. Our goalkeeper Stritzel made one great save in the 89th minute when he refused to be fooled by the onrushing Düsseldorf attacker. Overall, he did his best over the 90 minutes, but Düsseldorf were brutally efficient and the following also applies to us in football: Das Runde muss (vorne) ins Eckige, as we say in Germany.

## And now...

... it's off to the first "final" match away against Kaiserslautern on Saturday and I'll be there! The club has organised additional buses and offered them to the members because every fan is needed. 5 match days left and two of them against Kiel (1st place) and St Pauli (2nd place). We can no longer hope that the others will also lose, we have to make it on our own. LET'S GO!
