It's incredibly fun to browse the **[codepen.io](https://codepen.io/)** homepage because there's always something great to discover. Many of the works there are so excellent, that I save them for later in my Trello list so that I can perhaps use them somewhere at some point.

However, so many have now piled up there, that I have to break with my tradition of summarising the 10 best pens in one post at the end of the year and hereby publish a July 2024 edition.

Some of the pens I'm recommending here are not new, some are over a year or more old, but they're just too damn good to leave unmentioned...
