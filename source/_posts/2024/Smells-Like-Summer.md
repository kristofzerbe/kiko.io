A pleasant 23 degrees Celsius, the occasional cloud and a buzzing hum everywhere ... summer is just around the corner. Gorgeous!

While Thomas and his wife are in London at a garden show, looking at foreign flowers and plants (and buying some treasures, like a blue Tibetan Poppy), I'm hanging around his garden with my stovepipe, pointing at the wonderful colors and shapes of his already planted treasures.

I can now understand why this gives him so much pleasure, even if I don't need the dirty clothes and limit myself to capturing the beauty in the third part of my 2024 series in the form of photos for eternity.

Thomas, by the way: Your seedlings in the greenhouse are doing well :)
