To anticipate: I'm a fucking groupie when it comes to seeing **Daniel Wirtz** in action on stage. My wife (also a long-time fan) and I drove 400 and some crushed kilometres to **Leipzig** to see his show at the [Felsenkeller](https://www.felsenkeller-leipzig.com/). FINALLY he is back on tour with his new damn good and loud album [DNA](https://wirtz.bandzoogle.com/album/2657636/dna).

For those of you who don't know what the hell I'm talking about: Daniel Wirtz, or simply **WIRTZ**, is the only German rock artist who really deserves that name. You may forgive me, but I've been listening to Rock, Hard Rock, Metal and the like since the early 80s (my first album was KISS - Unmasked), and not one German citizen had enough rock in their blood for me like the Brits or Americans have in abundance. I was always of the opinion that Grunge, Nu Metal and all similar sounds couldn't come from Germany, let alone ... be performed with German lyrics! But I was wrong...

I first became aware of WIRTZ in 2015 on a nice German TV show called "[Sing mein Song- Das Tauschkonzert](https://www.vox.de/themen/thema/sing-meinen-song-das-tauschkonzert-2015-t8941.html)" (Sing My Song, The Swap Concert), where he rocked out songs by other artists in his inimitable way. He sang the lyrics of other authors and put his own guitar sound underneath. Awesome! But what is most ingenious about WIRTZ are his own lyrics. Straightforward on the one hand and very poetic on the other. Simply awesome shit in this combination!

(English translation, without end rhymes)

> You've won a ticket and when the film finally starts  
> you realise the trailer doesn't tell you what to expect at the end

> you can't ride the waves without getting wet

My last concert with WIRTZ was a while ago, but we had tickets for his unplugged tour ... but then the Corona pandemic hit and everything went to hell. Every now and then you could hear a sign of life from him on his [Instagram channel](https://www.instagram.com/daniel_wirtz/) and in between there was his lockdown album [Co-WiRtz 19](https://www.last.fm/de/music/Wirtz/Co+WIRTZ+19+(Lockdown+Versions)). As he said himself, it was a difficult time for him, but his fans and I are all the more pleased that he now has released such an amazing new album on the one hand and that he is simply back on the other.
