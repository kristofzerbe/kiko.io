Staying in Croatia is always a joy, in summer but also in winter. I'm on this side of the Adriatic sea almost every year. In summer you have a pleasant heat, inviting you to swim, and sometimes too many tourists. In winter you have the magic light and space to enjoy the country.

Over the past years a have created some presets to bring my images, shot in Croatia, to a next level of beauty and I want to share them with you in this post.

## Croatian Warm Sea

The sea in Croatia is amazing clear because almost the entire coast is made of stone instead of sand. There is hardly any algae or other things that cloud the wonderful green-blue water.

## Croatian Brightness

Yes, I'm guilty: I love colors and contrast! If you do also, his preset is for you. It brings out any image that is too flat or dull by helping to control the brightness and contrast.

## Croatian Winter Drama

A drive along the coast in the morning or evening hours makes you want to stop all the time because one panorama is more beautiful than the next.

## Croatian Winter City

The walls of Split have this wonderful warm tone of the winter sun and this preset brings this out particularly well.

## Croatian Winter Sunset

The sunset in Croatia is special for me, because I feel these wonderful colors and my camera isn't able to reproduce this feeling. This preset is an approximation of it.
