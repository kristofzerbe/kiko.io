Have you ever been in Scotland during summertime? Wonderful tranquility, great scenery and great photo opportunities at every turn. In 2019 I've made some great shots there and I want to share the presets with you, that I have developed for processing the photos from my trip through the Highlands and the Isle of Skye.

## Scotch Lights

So far in the north the light is totally different. When it shines through the clouds, it hits you.

## Scotch Strength

You must be made of different stuff if you are Scottish. There is hardly anything fine and graceful about the landscape and the weather. It's rough and tough and you have to deal with it.

## Scotch Sunset

The view over the North Sea at the edge of the continent is really unique, especially at sunset. Hear the the seagulls scream, the waves crashing against the cliffs and see the stunning colors.

## Scotch Energy

Scotland is bold and so full with energy, even in the details.

## Scotch Tattoo

The Edinburgh Military Tattoo, which takes place twice a year, is a feast for the senses. The incredible sound on one hand and the colors on the other. The brass, the feathers, the uniforms stand out in the setting sun.
