Whenever I can, I take photos and that's how a lot of them come together over the year. It's my passion, whether it's with my heavy Nikon and all the additional equipment or just with my smartphone: I love taking photos of different colours and shapes.

Some of them, exclusively still lifes, i.e. without people, are used here on this blog as header photos and this series tells you how and where I took these pictures.
