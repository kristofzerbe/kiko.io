Starting a new project is always exciting, especially when the building platform is totally new for oneself. As I started this blog in 2019 with <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>, I had a good experience with JavaScript and some with Node, but no with EJS, Lodash and some of the other libraries Hexo is using.

This series is a little technical diary, how I started the blog and implemented my needs one by one. Learning by doing. Maybe some of my solutions are valuable to somebody else, who faces the same issues I had.

In the meantime, the "New" in the name of the series is no longer really appropriate, but I'm keeping it for the sake of tradition.
