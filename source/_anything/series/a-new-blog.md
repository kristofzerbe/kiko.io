title: A New Blog
---

Starting a new project is always exciting, especially when the building platform is totally new for oneself. As I started this blog with <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>, I had a good experience with JavaScript and some with Node, but no with EJS, Lodash and some of the other libraries Hexo is using.

This series is a little technical diary, how I started the blog and implemented my needs one by one. Learning by doing. Maybe some of my solutions are valuable to somebody else, 
who faces the same issues I had.
