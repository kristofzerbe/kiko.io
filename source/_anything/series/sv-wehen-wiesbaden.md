In 2023 I discovered football for myself, in the form of the club of my hometown Wiesbaden (Hesse, Germany). How it came to this I have described in the initial article ["My Hometown, My Club"](/post/My-Hometown-My-Club) of this series, in which I report in loose order of my experiences and encounters in the stadium and around it.
