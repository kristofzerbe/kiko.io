It was a revelation. I pointed my camera on everything and spend all my little money in developing the negatives and getting the prints. My first big purchase was a Nikon F301 with some additional lenses and some equipment for my own black&#x2F;white darkroom at home in the bathroom, for the joy of my family. Since then, I’m addicted to photography. I have even tried to become a photographer and started an apprenticeship in Frankfurt&#x2F;Main after leaving school, but due to lack of support, I have given it up in favor of a “decent” profession, as my father would say ;) Today a have a lot of equipment, knowing that a good picture is done by the photographer and not by the camera, but it’s part of the fun, carrying 3 ore more kilos around my shoulder, to grab the right lens for the right shot. Find some of my photographs on 500px — https://500px.com/p/kikon The DeveloperI’m a creative person and most people are shaking their heads in disbelief, when I’m telling them, that IT has a lot to do with creativity and not with math. While learning a lot of stuff about business as an industrial clerk trainee at the German headquarter of Prime Computer around 1990 (the decent profession), there was a guy in the warehouse, Colin Urquhart, who was working with a new type of computer, a x68 machine from IBM and he taught me something about it and ignited my fascination about the possibilities of a computer. A little later I got in touch with a i386DX computer from Escom and started to fiddle around on how to achieve this or that under MS-DOS, installing Windows 3.x from a dozen of 3.5 discs, connecting via a 14.4k modem to the FidoNet (greets to all the guys from the 45er Infosystems) and talk shop with my fellow students at the University of Applied Aciences, Wiesbaden, department of economics. One of our teachers gave me a copy of Microsoft Access 1.1 and I started to explore the possibilities of this new relational database system. A short time later, our professor for computer science wanted to switch teaching DBase towards Access and so I became his assistant and held some class hours, where one of my students, having a little company on selling hardware, was asking me someday, if I was interested building Access-based software for his clients. I said yes. My starting point into a career as a freelance software developer. Years later, after dozens of clients, authoring a book about Access, coming and going technologies, building (and leaving) my own company Division by Zero with my good friend Marcus Michaels, I’m now Head of Software Development at SVG in Frankfurt, leading a bunch of cool software designers and engineers on developing good and relevant software … and my creativity is demanded day by day. I’m still first and foremost fascinated by the technology on building software, in particular in creating pleasing, but functional UI’s, a user wants to works with, even if I spend my daily working time on management stuff. So it is not surprising that I sit at my laptop in my spare time, working on my private projects or trying out new technologies. I made by hobby a profession… If you want to talk about the old, recent or new times in IT, you can find me at: Xinghttps://www.xing.com/profile/Kristof_Zerbe LinkedInhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/kristof-zerbe-91012510/ GitHubhttps://github.com/kristofzerbe The Tool GuyMy colleagues always start to giggle, when I’m telling them that I’ve found a new tool, which is doing this or that. I’m the Tool Guy. I love to look for those little helpers, which saves my time.

Many of my posts you see here now come from there and I mostly come here to respond to your replies. So it is possible for an old white guy like me to move, and maybe I can ease some of your fears and help with the move. You ask why you should and that almost nothing has changed here (yet)? Maybe, but the signs on the wall don’t bode well. Elon Musk is, if you look at it neutrally, someone who destroys things in order to rebuild them - better, in his sense.But that means change is coming. It will disturb you here, but it will come here maybe not in one fell swoop like a move to Mastodon. I’m always a friend of bringing about change myself, because then I can shape it in my own way and am not dependent on others. But it could be that you will still like Twitter in 12 or 18 months. I know this myself, my Twitter experience is by no means as negative as many others say.But many others, like me, go a different way, and are thus no longer accessible here. But that is exactly one of the biggest disadvantages of Twitter and one of the advantages of Mastodon.Let me explain. Many write that they are confused by these “instances” (some say “groups” which is not quite true) on Mastodon.I can understand that, it can be confusing. But what if I told you that there is also an instance on Twitter, but just exactly one. Twitter.com namely. This one can’t communicate with anything or anyone else, an island in the middle of a vast social media ocean. And now this island has been stupidly bought by someone whose idea of what such an island should look like is rather special. Mastodon has many such islands and they are connected with bridges. You choose an island, pitch your tents there and - you are not tied to this island. On the one hand you can communicate completely freely with all inhabitants of all other islands, on the other hand you can, if you want to, take down your tents again and move to another island (you will lose a little bit, but not as much as if you want to leave here [at Twitter]). These islands (instances) are of different sizes. The biggest ones in Germany are mastodon.social, troet.cafe, mastodon.green and a few others. But there are also tiny islands, I know more than one with a single inhabitant. Is he isolated on his island? No, because he is connected with all the others via said bridges. Every island has one (or more) chiefs who keep order (Twitter does too, but we’ve complained about that a lot). These chiefs are often private individuals who run an instance as a hobby, but with the large instances there is usually a team behind it, and some also a small company (mastodon.social, for example, is run by a limited liability company that was founded by the chief developer of the Mastodon software, mastodon.green is, as far as I know, a one-man limited liability company). So now we know that there are many islands, that we are not trapped on these islands and that we can move.These islands are one of the standout features of Mastodon: a Musk, a Trump, or even a certain four-letter newspaper can buy an island or even build an island themselves, but they can’t possibly buy all the islands, simply because it’s so cheap to build new islands. (I read somewhere once, to run an instance costs about 1€ per user per month). But because the interesting thing about Twitter, like Mastodon, is not the medium itself, but the networks we build on it, it doesn’t matter what happens to individual islands as long as we can move freely. If individual islands do not want to comply with the rules at all, then they are “defederated”, or figuratively: the bridges there are demolished. However, this is the decision of each individual island chief, so it may not be grassroots democracy, but it is distributed. Ok pjakobs, enough of the chatter, how am I supposed to find out which island is suitable for me?Here is a searchable list of Mastodon instances: instances.social&#x2F;list It is possible that another aspect of the “island” image will apply to you: there is a local timeline on the islands, which is also called that. So, if you choose an island that is particularly suited to a geographical region, a topic or a language, then you will see the contributions of the other “inhabitants of this island” in their local timeline - which hopefully have a certain thematic cohesion. However, as already mentioned, you can follow all people on all instances and you will also see them in your own timeline. Speaking of timelines: they are chronological and you only see the posts (toots) of those you follow. No algorithm, no “others like this too”, no good morning tweets in the late evening. Just the way Twitter used to be 10 years ago. Follow: here is one of the points that bothers me the most, even if it is a small thing. Currently there are two software versions of Mastodon in use: 3.5.3 and four, which seem to handle following a bit differently. In one (I assume the older version), if you want to follow an account on another instance, you have to specify your own handle again (in my case “@&#x70;&#106;&#97;&#107;&#x6f;&#98;&#115;&#64;&#109;&#97;&#115;&#116;&#111;&#100;&#111;&#x6e;&#x2e;&#103;&#114;&#x65;&#101;&#110;“ - but that’s no longer the case in the new version, there you click a follow button and you follow the account. Another thing that is very very different is DMs. Here on Twitter, we’re used to DMs essentially working like little emails or a messenger: we have our own inbox and that’s where the dialogue with the other person shows up. Feels good, not visible to others, because yes, in a completely different realm.In Mastodon, direct messages are simply toots that are displayed only to the recipient(s) - and normally among all the other interactions. It’s confusing and doesn’t feel as nicely protected as it does here, and as I walked around town a bit yesterday I realized: this is intentional. Twitter creates an apparent privacy through display that DMs don’t offer.DMs are deliberately not PM, not private messages. Mastodon also makes that clear through its presentation. I have therefore added my Threema and Telegram link to my profile, these tools actually offer private conversations. Is not comfortable but honest. You have created an account, but do not want to move 100% yet or, as in my case, still have many friends on this site? There is also a kind of “bridge” from Mastodon archipelago to Twitter. You can mirror your tweets to Mastodon or vice versa. This is only valid for tweets, not for replies. That means you have to be a bit careful that you don’t just spam your followers in the other network, but also interact with them. After a few days of mirroring from Twitter to Mastodon I turned the bridge around, today probably 80% of the tweets you see from me and the non-replies are on Mastodon. I use crossposter.masto.donte.com.br for this. The lovely people from @digitalcourage not only run a Mastodon instance themselves, but also put together a great overview of the Fediverse (the federated social media universe, which is much more than just Mastodon). In summary, if Musk is really fucking this up, you don’t have to be a helpless victim of his actions. Even if Mastodon might not be an alternative for you at the moment, create an account, try to find your followers over there. A life raft is not as comfortable as a floating boat, but it’s better than a sinking boat! Ah, here’s another more complete overview of Mastodon:the-federation.info&#x2F;mastodon (takes a little while to load) --- Peter Jakobs You will find Peter Jakobs on this island: @pjakobs@mastodon.green.

I have to say that I am currently very interested in creating PWAs and the techniques behind them, and I’m always looking for new resources to read. So it didn’t take me 5 minutes to start reading posts in Mastodon with the hashtag #pwa almost automatically. What can I say? It works… Step 1Search for an hash tag, f.e. #pwa. It will lead to an Url like this, depending on your Mastodon server: https://indieweb.social/web/tags/pwa Step 2Cut out /web Step 3Add .rss … and you got your feed on a special topic … … you can add to your favorite feed reader.

If you research this topic on the web, you have to dig through many architecture pages and documentations that have one thing in common: sometimes they just don’t get to the point. So here are my 50 cents on the subject and my sample implementation. Preliminary ThoughtsIn most examples I’ve read, the authors talk about code for the app itself and code for the Service Worker, but that falls short to me, because in my opinion there are THREE parts: The App The Service Worker The Service Worker Management, which takes care of the proper registration and installation of the service worker The last part of the code shouldn’t be part of the app itself, in the meaning of SoC (Seperation of Concerns). It does not contribute to the functioning of the app. The AppHere’s the general anatomy of my App: app.js123456789101112131415161718192021var app = &#123; &#x27;settings&#x27;: &#123; // some stuff on app settings ... &#125;, &#x27;pages&#x27;: &#123; // views of the SPA ... &#125;, &#x27;ui&#x27;: &#123; // some UI helper &#x27;dialog&#x27;: function(msg, title) &#123; // show the message in a toast, popup or elsewhere &#125; &#125;, &#x27;starter&#x27;: &#123; &#x27;init&#x27;: &#123; // initializing of the app ... &#125; &#125;&#125;window.app = app;app.starter.init(); Nothing unlikely, as I guess. It is built according to the composite pattern and has one entry point, that is called at the end of the file after it is instantiated. The Service WorkerThe Service Worker lives in its own JS file and its implementation is really straight forward: service-worker.js12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728var cacheName = &#x27;my-apps-cache-v1.2.3&#x27;;var appFiles = [ // list of app relating files, that has to be handled]var excludeUrls = [ // list if URL&#x27;s that shouldn&#x27;t be handled]self.addEventListener(&#x27;install&#x27;, function(e) &#123; // on install, open the cache and add all appFiles ... //activate immediatly and dont wait for connected clients to disconnect self.skipWaiting();&#125;self.addEventListener(&#x27;activate&#x27;, function(e) &#123; // remove old caches //say to all clients: Now I&#x27;m responsible self.clients.claim();&#125;self.addEventListener(&#x27;fetch&#x27;, function(e) &#123; // intercept requests and serve the app files out of the cache&#125; I won’t go into the depth of my implementation here now, since it doesn’t matter for the message exchange. It is only good for you to know that I have versioned the cache name to exchange it with new versions. The Service Worker ManagementNow the management code for the Service Worker. It has to be loaded with the app code, because it is client code and later on it needs knowledge of the app. sw-management.js1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132if(&#x27;serviceWorker&#x27; in navigator) &#123; navigator.serviceWorker.register(&#x27;service-worker.js&#x27;) .then(function(registration) &#123; // detect Service Worker update available registration.addEventListener(&#x27;updatefound&#x27;, function() &#123; if (registration.installing) &#123; // detect install of new Service Worker registration.installing.addEventListener(&#x27;statechange&#x27;, function() &#123; if (registration.waiting) &#123; if (navigator.serviceWorker.controller) &#123; // there is an existing controller that has been updated //TODO: Send a message to the app &#125; else &#123; // first install &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125;&#125; Lets Communicate…In this setup, the communication code can be implemented. Let’s do it as a round trip. 1. Client sends message to Service WorkerAs sw-management.js represents our Service Worker management code, we add a little function to send a message in here: sw-management.js1234567function sendMessageToServiceWorker(type, msg) &#123; if (navigator.serviceWorker.controller) &#123; navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage( &#123;&#x27;type&#x27;: type, &#x27;msg&#x27;: msg &#125; ); &#125;&#125; We define a type for the purpose of our communcation and a message itself. The function can be called wherever, like this: 1sendMessageToServiceWorker(&quot;TEST&quot;, &quot;Hey, Service Worker&quot;); 2. Service Worker receives the messageIn the Service Worker code we need to add a recipient: service-worker.js1234567self.addEventListener(&#x27;message&#x27;, function(event) &#123; if (!event.data) return; if (event.data.type === &#x27;TEST&#x27;) &#123; // do something regarding to the type and/or with the message &#125;&#125; 3. … and sends a message back to the clientWhat we want to do with the message depends what we want to achive, but in this example, just let’s greet back: service-worker.js12345678910111213141516171819function sendMessageToClients(type, msg) &#123; // as the SW can control multiple clients, we have to catch them all self.clients.matchAll(&#123; includeUncontrolled: true &#125;) .then(function(clients) &#123; for (const client of clients) &#123; client.postMessage( &#123;&#x27;type&#x27;: type, &#x27;msg&#x27;: msg &#125; ); &#125; &#125;);&#125;self.addEventListener(&#x27;message&#x27;, function(event) &#123; if (!event.data) return; if (event.data.type === &#x27;TEST&#x27;) &#123; sendMessageToClients(event.data.type, &#x27;Hi Clients...&#x27;); &#125;&#125; 4. Client receives the answer from the Service WorkerIn order to get messages from the Service Worker, we have to implement a receiver in the client also: sw-management.js12345678910if(&#x27;serviceWorker&#x27; in navigator) &#123; //... &#x27;navigator.serviceWorker.register&#x27; stuff navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener(&#x27;message&#x27;, function(event) &#123; if (event.data) &#123; // do something with the message from the Service Worker &#125; &#125;);&#125; 5. … and shows it in the appAs I pointed out earlier, that the management code has to be loaded alongside with the app code, it’s a breeze to show the message: app.js1234567891011121314var app = &#123; ... &#x27;ui&#x27;: &#123; // some UI helper &#x27;dialog&#x27;: function(msg, title) &#123; // show the message in a toast, popup or elsewhere &#125; &#125; ...&#125;window.app = app;... sw-management.js12345678910if(&#x27;serviceWorker&#x27; in navigator) &#123; //... &#x27;navigator.serviceWorker.register&#x27; stuff navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener(&#x27;message&#x27;, function(event) &#123; if (event.data) &#123; app.ui.dialog.info(event.data.msg, &#x27;Service Worker says...&#x27;); &#125; &#125;);&#125; The Update MessageWith this infrastructure, everything is there to show a message, when the Service Worker is updated: sw-management.js123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536if(&#x27;serviceWorker&#x27; in navigator) &#123; navigator.serviceWorker.register(&#x27;service-worker.js&#x27;) .then(function(registration) &#123; // detect Service Worker update available registration.addEventListener(&#x27;updatefound&#x27;, function() &#123; if (registration.installing) &#123; // detect install of new Service Worker registration.installing.addEventListener(&#x27;statechange&#x27;, function() &#123; if (registration.waiting) &#123; if (navigator.serviceWorker.controller) &#123; // there is an existing controller that has been updated app.ui.dialog.info(&#x27;New version installed&#x27;, &#x27;Service Worker&#x27;); &#125; else &#123; // first install &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; ...&#125; Important to point out, that the Service Worker side of the communication is not involved in this case, because only the client-side management code knows when a new version has to be installed.

And spread out on the table are three mice in different colors so as not to constantly get the wrong one. A scenario that the author of these lines was also confronted with … yes, until a few years ago a small tool for Microsoft Windows fell in front of his feet, which abruptly ended the input chaos: Mouse Without Borders. Microsoft, like many IT corporations, encourages its employees to create side projects, which then either eventually find their way into one of the main products or are released under the Microsoft Garage banner. This is also the case with the work of Truong Do, a Microsoft employee from Washington, who deals with Microsoft Dynamics in his daily business. He was probably also fed up with the numerous input devices and developed a tool more than 10 years ago with which the mouse pointer of a Windows device can be moved across its own monitor border to another device, whereby one of the keyboards is then activated on the device on which the mouse pointer is currently located. The startup is simple: Download tool via http://aka.ms/mm Make sure that all devices are available on the same network Run the installation program on all devices From one device, link the other devices using the security code generated by the program Arrange the devices on the desktop in the program by dragging and dropping them from their locations Done Other featuresBesides the main purpose of sharing mouse and keyboard across multiple devices, you can also set up a shared clipboard (Share Clipboard) and make it possible to copy files from one computer to another via drag &amp; drop (Transfer File). This creates a special folder on the desktop of the target computer, where these files end up via the clipboard. It is also useful that the user does not become a long-distance pusher when the pointer is on the far right device and he has to go to the far left, because where it stops on the right, it continues on the far left. For keyboard lovers, Truong Do has made keyboard shortcuts available for each linked device, with a choice of F-keys or numbers. All machines can also be locked at once via Ctrl-Alt-L. If the connection hangs once, a spirited Ctrl-Alt-R helps to get them all back on track. As an extra goodie, Truong Do has included a narrow-gauge screenshot capture, but you can safely turn it off, because it can’t compete with tools like Brian Scott’s Cropper or Greenshot, but rather hinders because it uses common keyboard shortcuts. ConclusionYes, multiple large monitors and classic remote solutions like RDP or TeamViewer help to operate multiple machines at the same time, but when you have the zoo of devices physically together, working with Mouse Without Borders feels like having four or more monitors, with the advantage that the individual machines don’t have to give up any of their performance. The nice thing, too, is that it doesn’t matter at all what version of Windows is running on the devices. Everything from Windows 7 upwards is supported.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Windows","slug":"Windows","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Windows/"},{"name":"Workflow","slug":"Workflow","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Workflow/"},{"name":"Remote","slug":"Remote","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Remote/"}]},{"title":"Creating Icon Font from SVG Files","subtitle":null,"date":"2022-09-17","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Creating-Icon-Font-from-SVG-Files/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Creating-Icon-Font-from-SVG-Files/","excerpt":"A several years ago I started building a little PWA and chose Bootswatch 3.3.5. for theming.

Following options were used: gulp-iconfont-css Option Description fontName Name that the generated font will have path Path to the template for generating CSS file targetPath Path where the CSS file will be generated fontPath Path to the icon font file gulp-iconfontThe library combines some other projects such as svgicons2svgfont, gulp-svgicons2svgfont and gulp-svg2ttf to create the different font formats, because its just a wrapper around them. Option Description formats Font file formats that will be created fontName Name of the font (for svgicons2svgfont) fontHeight Minimum height on scaling icons normalize Normalize icons by scaling them to the height of the highest icon (for svgicons2svgfont) prependUnicode Prefix files with their automatically allocated unicode code point (for gulp-svgicons2svgfont) timestamp Get consistent builds when watching files (for gulp-svg2ttf) OutputAfter running gulp build all files needed were generated: 1234567|-- Build |-- MyAppIcons.css |-- MyAppIcons.eot |-- MyAppIcons.svg |-- MyAppIcons.ttf |-- MyAppIcons.woff |-- MyAppIcons.woff2 MyAppIcons.css1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344@font-face &#123; font-family: &quot;MyAppIcons&quot;; src: url(&#x27;MyAppIcons.eot&#x27;); src: url(&#x27;MyAppIcons.eot?#iefix&#x27;) format(&#x27;eot&#x27;), url(&#x27;MyAppIcons.woff2&#x27;) format(&#x27;woff2&#x27;), url(&#x27;MyAppIcons.woff&#x27;) format(&#x27;woff&#x27;), url(&#x27;MyAppIcons.ttf&#x27;) format(&#x27;truetype&#x27;), url(&#x27;MyAppIcons.svg#MyAppIcons&#x27;) format(&#x27;svg&#x27;);&#125;.icon:before &#123; font-family: &quot;MyAppIcons&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;&#125;.icon-alert:before &#123; content: &quot;\\E001&quot;;&#125;.icon-cancel:before &#123; content: &quot;\\E002&quot;;&#125;.icon-delete:before &#123; content: &quot;\\E003&quot;;&#125;.icon-email:before &#123; content: &quot;\\E004&quot;;&#125;.icon-flag:before &#123; content: &quot;\\E005&quot;;&#125;.icon-link:before &#123; content: &quot;\\E006&quot;;&#125; All I had to do now, was to reference the new CSS file in my HTML and decorating my HTML tags with one of the new icon-classes. Yes! My had my own icon font, just by copying some SVG files in a folder… The ProblemA while later, as my app grew, I needed some new icons, but in the meantime I had used the content codes elsewhere in static CSS files, for example with other pseudo-selectors like AFTER. style.css1234.my-special-link::after &#123; font-family: &quot;MyAppIcons&quot;; content: &quot;\\E006&quot;;&#125; After copying a few new icon files to the SVG folder and running the build, I found that most of the icons didn’t fit anymore!? After a short research it was clear to me what had happened. With the insertion of the new SVG files, the order of the files in the folder was changed. But since the libraries processed this folder in alphabetical order, file by file, and simply incremented the codes to be assigned, the codes had simply shifted. In the example above, this can be easily understood if we insert a file named cloud.svg here. The code for cancel.svg (E002) remains untouched, but cloud.svg now gets E003 and delete.svg E004 and so on. The hardwired icon for .my-special-link (E006) now showed instead of the link icon a flag icon. Newer SolutionI don’t know when this happened, because I don’t keep a constant eye on my little PWA and thus the further development of the related tools, but after having manually adjusted the moved codes two or three times now and once again wanting to change a few things on the PWA’s icons, I had enough and came across the following sentence on the gulp-iconfont-css page on GitHub: Recent versions of gulp-iconfont emit a glyphs (or codepoints &lt; 4.0.0) event (see docs) which should likely be used instead of the workflow described below. However, it will continue to work as expected. --- backflip (Thomas Jaggi) Ahh, ok. I don’t need the gulp-iconfont-css anymore. I can create the CSS file by myself. Lets see how the gulp-iconfont task looks, after rewriting: /gulpfile.js1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950var iconfont = require(&#x27;gulp-iconfont&#x27;);var distFolder = &#x27;Build&#x27;;var fontObj = &#123; fontName: &quot;MyAppIcons&quot;, cssClass: &quot;icon&quot;&#125;;gulp.task(&quot;create-iconfont&quot;, function () &#123; return gulp .src([&quot;Images/SVG/*.svg&quot;]) .pipe( iconfont(&#123; fontName: fontObj.fontName, fontHeight: 1001, formats: [&quot;svg&quot;, &quot;ttf&quot;, &quot;eot&quot;, &quot;woff&quot;, &quot;woff2&quot;], normalize: true, prependUnicode: true, timestamp: Math.round(Date.now() / 1000), &#125;) ) .on(&quot;glyphs&quot;, function (glyphs, options) &#123; fontObj.glyphs = glyphs.map(mapGlyphs); console.log(fontObj, options); gulp .src(&#x27;Templates/icons-template.css&#x27;) .pipe(consolidate(&quot;lodash&quot;, fontObj)) .pipe(rename(&#123; basename: fontObj.fontName &#125;)) .pipe(gulp.dest(distFolder)); &#125;) .pipe(gulp.dest(distFolder));&#125;);function mapGlyphs(glyph) &#123; return &#123; fileName: glyph.name, codePoint: glyph.unicode[0].charCodeAt(0).toString(16).toUpperCase(), &#125;;&#125;gulp.task(&#x27;build&#x27;, gulp.series( &#x27;create-iconfont&#x27; // other gulp tasks )); First I have introduced a new fontObj variable to hold all informations for the untouched CSS template. The major difference is now, that iconfont is the only main task, with a subtask where the glyphs are processed directly via consolidate. The mapGlyphs() function ensures that the file names with the CodePoints are transferred into an easily usable structure. Works fine, but doesn’t solve my problem with the shifted CodePoints, when inserting new SVG icons … but someone remarked in a StackOverflow article to have a look at the test files of gulp-iconfont. There, the SVG files carry as prefix the name of the CodePoints to be used for this file!. Unfortunately, this feature is not documented, but it works… 123456789|-- Images |-- SVG |-- uE001-alert.svg |-- uE002-cancel.svg |-- uE003-delete.svg |-- uE004-email.svg |-- uE005-flag.svg |-- uE006-link.svg |-- uE007-cloud.svg Now the order of the SVG files doesn’t matter anymore. I just copy a new SVG file into the folder and rename it with a currently unused Unicode. Upcoming Solution: Using SVG SpritesInterestingly, the inventor of gulp-iconfont page writes on the GiHub page: Warning: While this plugin may still be useful for fonts generation or old browser support, you should consider using SVG icons directly. Indeed, when i created gulp-iconfont and all its related modules, using SVG icons was just not realistic for a wide browser suppport but i was already conviced that SVG was the future, that’s why i wanted my SVG source files to sit separated in a folder. So, now, just enjoy switching to SVG with almost no effort :).

Especially if you work a lot with pesudo selectors, a general rebuild of the code and the UI will be necessary and you would do well to weigh the cost-benefit carefully.","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Bundling","slug":"Bundling","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Bundling/"},{"name":"SVG","slug":"SVG","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/SVG/"},{"name":"Font","slug":"Font","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Font/"}]},{"title":"Dopamine, a music player for Windows 10 as it should be","subtitle":"A minimalist MP3 player under Windows, distributed as open source, which does not shy away from large collections","series":"Golem","date":"2022-08-21","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Dopamine-a-music-player-for-Windows-10-as-it-should-be/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Dopamine-a-music-player-for-Windows-10-as-it-should-be/","excerpt":"There are about fourleventy millions music apps for smartphones running Android and iOS.

It plays music under a plain and simple, yet chic interface … Period. Everything a music lover’s heart desires is on board: Automatic reading of a folder configured at the beginning. Display of the collection by artist, genre, album, title or folder Playlist management Light and dark theme, including setting the accent color Interface in 30 languages Integration with taskbar and notification bar Automatic updates tns({ container: \"#image-slide-6jb3uh\", items: 1, slideBy: \"page\", controls: false, nav: true }); The design of the application is instantly convincing. Everything is limited to the most necessary, an accent color and a lot of white e.g. gray space, so that not only the ear feels comfortable with the music, but also the eye. And all this at a very good speed and nicely animated transitions from one view to another. Besides the basic ability to play MP3 files, the author has also included a rudimentary, but well-functioning editing function of the MP3 metadata. Furthermore, any star assignments or added lyrics are stored directly in the file and not just in the SQLite database behind it. However, Godart has also included a few useful things from the Featuritis department in its program. On the one hand, it downloads information from last.fm about the currently played artist and you can scrobble there if you like, and on the other hand, it scans some lyric collections for the lyrics, which unfortunately rarely works. Quite unique is one of the most recently added features: a blacklist! Yes, many an album of a favorite musician contains a track that he would have been better off sparing himself. Such pieces can now be specifically hidden, so that the musical enjoyment is not spoiled. Further developmentNew releases of Dopamine 2 since version 2.0.8 are not as frequent as before, because the program is basically developed out and Raphaël only adds smaller features, translations and bugfixes. Instead, 4 years after the release of the first version two years ago, he has embarked on a completely new development with version 3. Where Dopamine up to version 2 was developed with Microsoft C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), the latest will be based on Electron, Angular and Typescript, i.e. packaged web technology (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) for all operating systems and not just Windows. Currently, Godart has reached Preview 10, which has by far not the same scope of the previous version, but is already running stable. Music in the cloudIf you’re on the go and have stored your music on a cloud service like Microsoft’s OneDrive, you might pay attention to the fact that on a device connected to it, the entire collection is not downloaded, but only selected parts in order to save local storage space. Microsoft makes it easy for users there: it displays all OneDrive files in Windows Explorer with 0 bytes of space used and only downloads them when they are accessed or when the user selects Always keep on this device in a folder’s context menu. This works quite beautifully with Dopamine 2. It, with support from C# and the operating system, simply ignores all those files that are not available on the disk in real terms when scanning the specified music folder. Dopamine 3, on the other hand, in which the scan must take place via Node.js and the fs.readdir() method, immediately triggers the download function of OneDrive and you unintentionally fill up your disk. Curiosity on the sideRaphaël’s C#&#x2F;WPF solution weighs 76 MB when installed, 2.5 MB of it for the executable, the new Electron-based one under Windows, however, already 302 MB, with the EXE being a whopping 128 MB. If you take a look at the code base, this becomes even more obvious: while the Windows-only version comes along with 760 files, the new Electron version already contains 86,092 files in 7,948 folders with a total weight of almost one gigabyte after running npm install! Once again you can see that platform independence in the brave new Node.JS world is often bought with heavy weight. This is mainly due to the necessity (or the unkindness, depending on how you look at it) to drag along thousands of dependent libraries (dependencies), which occasionally only bring a string to a certain width or something similarly trivial. Not to mention the problems with depublicated or malware-infested dependencies, which have recently upset large parts of the community. ConclusionDopamine 2 is a really fantastic music player for Windows that simply outshines most others due to its simplicity and well-done interface. Let’s see if Godard manages to do something similar with version 3 and Electron. It’s a challenge, but he seems to be a full-blooded developer.

It all started with the Monaco Editor, the core around which VS Code is built and which was first released on April 14, 2016. The exciting thing about Monaco and VS Code is, that it is consistently written using web technologies, i.e. HTML, CSS and Javascript, packaged and executed using the framework Electron developed by GitHub, which in turn is based on Node.js and the open source browser engine Chromium from Google. It is not really surprising that the developers have built a really good editor from the start, which could directly defy the first Chromium-based tool Brackets from Adobe at that time, because Erich Gamma was the head of the development environment Eclipse for many years and therefore knows about the needs of the worldwide developer community. Surprisingly however is already, that although VS Code is based on Web technologies, it took some years, until the editor made it out of its Electron cardboard, directly into the Browser. For example, it wasn’t until 2020, 2 years after Microsoft acquired GitHub, that they announced github.dev, which is just a call target for the newly introduced Magic Dot and opens a project hosted on GitHub in the browser. For those who like to try it out, just go to any GitHub repository and hit the DOT key and the project will open in a VS Code browser window. A variant of this is vscode.dev, which can open not only GitHub projects, but any from your own hard drive. However, both browser editors have one thing in common: you can code wonderfully on the go, but you cannot start the projects and thus also not validate your own code for executability. The substructure is missing and is therefore not a real IDE. No pre-processing via Grunt or Gulp, no starting web server or similar, simply because there is no console that could communicate with the operating system. However, Microsoft has also announced another tool in 2020 that is supposed to bring exactly this substructure via cloud container: GitHub Codespaces. Beta access has been expanding for a few weeks now, and it should be available for team and enterprise cloud plans starting in August. Cloud-based development environment from Kiel, Germany: GitpodA team around Sven Efftinge and Anton Kosyakov from the beautiful city of Kiel, asked themselves the question why not build an online development environment back in 2017 and launched the project Theia under the umbrella of the Eclipse Foundation. The idea was to develop a remote-first IDE that runs both locally and in the browser and fully supports the numerous VS Code extensions already available. They named the actual product around Theia Gitpod (gitpod.io). Although there are still numerous Theia solutions available today, such as Eclipse Che, Stackblitz or the Google Cloud Shell Editor, Gitpod decided to move to the VS Code platform in late 2020 after Erich Gamma and his team provided Remote Support in VS Code, on which github.dev is based, among others. However, since Microsoft had decided not to open source the server component for the time being (the commercial GitHub CodeSpaces sends its regards), Anton, by his own account, created a first working version of the Open VSCode Server in 4 days, which was released in September 2021. Not a month later, Microsoft also made its own server solution freely available, but with a few restrictions, among other things, regarding the extensions that can be obtained from Gitpod via the Open VSX Registry portal, since the Microsoft Extension Marketplace is reserved for Microsoft’s own products. The name and the technology behind itThe name gitpod already tells us something about the technology behind the service. ‘git’ stands for the file management system behind the editor and ‘pod’ for the server technology under the editor. git…Nowadays, source code is (hopefully) no longer just stored locally on a hard disk, but centrally and managed by source code management software. The current gold standard in this area is the free Git initiated by Linus Torvalds in 2005, a distributed version management that forms the basis of popular developer platforms such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. …podA short step back in time: It’s not so long ago that IT’ers called an environment on which they published a server application machines, because it first needed hardware with processor, main memory, hard disks and an operating system of choice, which was then installed and on that in turn the said application. However, if the server application was only used sporadically, the expensive hardware was underutilized, i.e. resources were wasted. To solve this problem, work began in the 1970s on virtualizing hardware so that several logically separate systems could share the hardware to increase its utilization. Any operating system and the required server applications can be installed and operated in each of the virtual machines (VM’s) created in this way. In this concept, however, there are redundancies in the form of the operating system. If, for example, you want to run 5 Linux-based web servers, you will also have to loop along 5 possibly identical Ubuntu installations that want to be maintained. Docker is not the only, but most well-known software that addressed this problem in 2013 by abstracting another layer, in this case the operating system. Here we are now no longer talking about a machine or VM, but a container in which the server application runs. For the orchestration of these containers, the software Kubernetes initiated by Google has been available since 2015, in which the smallest deployable unit is called a pod, which contains one or more containers that share the allocated resources. Such a pod with a ready installed and configured Open VSCode Server is launched on Google Cloud Platform when a user opens a Gidpod Workspace. Let’s go … Starting a Gitpod WorkspaceIn Gitpod, you launch a project hosted on Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket into a so-called workspace. To do this, simply prepend the url of your repository with the string gitpod.io&#x2F;#. Those who prefer buttons, can either use a provided bookmarklet and resort to a browser extension that adds a Gitpod button to the Github interface. Once the workspace has been started and you have closed the browser window, it will be available for a while on the dashboard under Workspaces. If you work frequently with the same project, it is advisable to create a permanent shortcut there under Projects if you are not into manual url changes or buttons. Last but not least, the icing on the cake is to install one of these Gitpod projects as a Chrome App and drop it in the toolbar. That way, the code is just a click away and the whole thing almost feels like a local VS Code due to the reduced browser window. Configuration of the workspace of a projectIn addition to the general setting options, Gitpod offers an individual configuration per project. For this the file .gitpod.yml is searched in the root of the project folder and used. All setting options are well documented in the gitpod Docs. Using a custom containerThe default container that Gitpod boots up when starting a workspace is based on Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu and already includes a lot of frameworks and languages like Node, Java, Go, Python and some more. However, if you want to use a different image, you can set this via the image entry, either by referencing a public image or by specifying the name of a Dockerfile in the project. The possibilities here are numerous and can be found in the section Custom Docker Image. Tasks at startupTo get a project running in Visual Studio Code, especially in the Node environment, there are a few things that need to be set up, such as installing the correct Node.js version and dependent packages using NPM or another package manager. The same is true for Gitpod, of course, although these actions need to be done again and again after the working environment has been started, for example, if the pod has been discarded after a while. For these recurring tasks, the software provides the Tasks section in the .gitpod.yml and there, in the forefront, the init entry. In the following example, Node 14.17, all local packages and one global package are installed as a multi-line task: 12345tasks: - init: | nvm install 14.17.2 npm install npm install -g grunt-cli With the grouping and naming of tasks, the terminal display settings and the total of three execution levels before, init and command it is easy to create a configuration that starts up the workspace in a fixed way while keeping an overview. If you like it even a bit faster, you can use so-called Prebuilds, which serve as a snapshot for creating a new workspace. These prebuilds use the .gitpod.yml of the project and are closely linked to the source code management used (currently GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket). Thus, a prebuild is recreated each time modified code is checked into the project. It doesn’t get much faster and more convenient to code from anywhere in the browser. Include extensions automaticallyWhen creating the gitpod workspace, the configuration file .gitpod.yml can also be used to include the Visual Studio code extensions that are needed for working. The easiest way to do this is if the extension is represented on the open platform Open VSX Registry, because gitpod looks for the pattern $&#123;publisher&#125;.$&#123;name&#125; there by default. Example: 1234vscode: extensions: - HookyQR.beautify - kamikillerto.vscode-colorize However, VSIX files from other sources can also be included via the full url. Microsoft offers with the Visual Studio Marketplace the primary and largest source of extensions, but unfortunately omits the specification of a complete download path of the VSIX file. However, it is very easy to build this using the following pattern: https://$&#123;publisher&#125;.gallery.vsassets.io/_apis/public/gallery/publisher/$&#123;publisher&#125;/extension/$&#123;extension&#125;/$&#123;version&#125;/assetbyname/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.VSIXPackage The necessary information about the variables Publisher, Extension and Version in this pattern can be obtained from the details page of an extension in Visual Studio Code. Output: 123456Name: vscode-hexo-utilsId: fantasy.vscode-hexo-utilsDescription: vscode extension for hexoVersion: 0.2.1Publisher: fantasyVS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fantasy.vscode-hexo-utils This will result in the following entry in .gitpod.yml: 123vscode: extensions: - https://fantasy.gallery.vsassets.io/_apis/public/gallery/publisher/fantasy/extension/vscode-hexo-utils/0.2.1/assetbyname/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.VSIXPackage Synchronize settingsEvery IDE looks different, depending on the tastes and preferences of the developer sitting in front of it, and so relatively quickly after the first release of VS Code, there were the first extensions that could synchronize the IDE’s settings across multiple machines (mostly via Gists), until Microsoft took on the feature and integrated it directly into the IDE. Now, with Gitpod, we have a new but slightly different instance of Visual Studio Code, but the Kielers thought of that, too. They couldn’t access the data of the integrated synchronization, but they created a by-pass with their own extension that works just as well. After the installation in VS Code and a restart of the same, one logs in to the extension with the same account under which one has registered with Gitpod and can thereafter synchronize tasks, code snippets extensions and keyboard shortcuts in addition to the settings. Prices and ServicesGitpod is a company and has to look like all others, how it can work cost-covering. Therefore, as is often the case, there are different plans that can be booked. There are four of them at Gidpod in the Saas area, whereby Free differs from the other plans only in the possible computing time, the timeout and the parallel running workspaces. Thus, in the Free plan, there are 50 hours that you can work with 4 WorkSpaces and in case of inactivity, the pods are shut down again after 30 minutes. A fair free offer for all those who want to code on the go, but most of the time have a computer and a locally installed VS Code. You can also host Gitpod yourself on an existing managed Kubernetes environment, for example if you are already a customer of cloud service providers like Amazon, Azure or Google. ConclusionIt will be exciting to see to what extent Microsoft’s own GitHub CodeSpaces will be able to hold its own against this really very manageable opponent once it has been launched en masse. The team from Kiel has at least already set the bar very high, also because it is fantastically documented and structured. A real gain for every tool collection.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"VS Code","slug":"VS-Code","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/VS-Code/"},{"name":"GitHub","slug":"GitHub","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/GitHub/"},{"name":"Remote","slug":"Remote","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Remote/"}]},{"title":"Discoveries #19 - Visual Helpers","subtitle":null,"series":"Discoveries","date":"2022-07-09","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Discoveries-19-Visual-Helpers/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Discoveries-19-Visual-Helpers/","excerpt":"Colors and images are the visual meat on the boil of any web solution.

Color.js - Let's get serious about color by Lea Verou & Chris Lilley&nbsp;https://colorjs.io/ As Lea Verou says in her blog post on releasing Color.js, there was a lack of color libraries that did the things she (and many others) needed on working with colors.

If you are more familiar with JS, you can use Vanilla JS with lots of createElement and setAttribut or the wrapper solution from Graphery, which is chainable and very well documented. Flickity by Evan S&nbsp;https://codepen.io/Skoulix/pen/BRJRPd Last but not least, a very cool hero image solution from Evan. It uses the parallax effect for sliding hero images in the background.

It was based on templates with placeholders for the data and configurable via an INI file. The data could come either from the ActiveDirectory via LDAP or from any database. I had quite a large fan base and even years later I kept getting requests to integrate new features. The problem I faced after releasing the last version 1.9 in 2008 was on the one hand that Microsoft had fundamentally changed the handling of signatures in Outlook and on the other hand that VB6 was no longer really en-vogue, because everybody (and me too) was switching to VB.NET or C# and that would have meant a complete re-write for me. But there were already commercial alternatives to OutlookSignature at that time and I had turned to other projects, but it was available into 2012 until I decided to close my personal blog. However, to this day there are one or two websites where you can download or find information about it. OutlookSignature was always freeware, but never Open Source, because of the fact, that I used some code, that did not come from me and was not approved for publication. Accidental Discovery of a Go-based ImplementationI own the domain zerbit.de until today and the other day I was looking on the web for some references to it and stumbled across a GitHub page with the title An open source reimplementation of Kristof Zerbe’s (ZerbIT) “OutlookSignature” … What The Heck!? I don’t know who the user ‘foobar0815’ is, but he&#x2F;she is definitely German and had the patience to rebuild my tool in the modern language Go in 2019. GoSignature uses the orginal INI configuation file, with the field mappings and all the other stuff, but the database connection feature. It works only with LDAP, which is quite enough today. I have no idea about Go, but I will certainly look into it a bit in the near future and find out if this thing works. If you have already tried GoSignature or even if you are the author, please contact me. Would be fun to talk about it… :)","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Mail","slug":"Mail","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Mail/"},{"name":"Office","slug":"Office","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Office/"}]},{"title":"Simplest Console File Logger","subtitle":"How to implement your own logger with just a StringBuilder in C#","date":"2022-06-19","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Simplest-Console-File-Logger/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Simplest-Console-File-Logger/","excerpt":"When you need to do a task in IT and don’t need a fancy user interface, you usually turn to a console application or develop one.

Many times this overload is simply not necessary, when you just need a log file for each run of your console application. Let me show you, how to achieve this with a dead simple StringBuilder… Lets start in the Program.cs of a new .NET Core 6 console application. As you may know, in this version MS has changed the entry point static void Main(string[] args), which has existed for what feels like centuries, to the so-called Top-Level Statements, which means nothing else, that the entry point is now automatically generated … and what most old-school developer think sucks, because you have little control over it anymore. But for this approach we need a global variable and therefore I’ve recreated Main like this: Program.cs123456789101112// TOP-LEVEL STATEMENTSMain.Start(args);// MAIN MODULEstatic public class Main &#123; static public void Start(string[] args) &#123; //... &#125;&#125; Preparation of a small senseless console applicationLet’s implement a little bit of the ‘features‘ first, like a new class called DoSomething that does the actual job: DoSomething.cs123456789101112public class DoSomething&#123; public void Work(string param1) &#123; //... doing heavy work with param1 &#125; public void MoreWork(string param2) &#123; //... doing more work with param2 &#125;&#125; Now let’s process the command line arguments for running the app called SimplestConsoleFileLogger like this… SimplestConsoleFileLogger.exe param1:this param2:that First we create a new class for holding the parameters… Parameters.cs12345public class Parameter&#123; public string Param1 = &quot;&quot;; public string Param2 = &quot;&quot;;&#125; … and then we populate a new instance of it with the values from the console arguments and run the worker class: Program.cs1234567891011121314151617181920212223static public class Main &#123; static Parameter PARAMETER = new Parameter(); static public void Start(string[] args) &#123; //Process Arguments foreach (string arg in args) &#123; var a = arg.Split(&#x27;:&#x27;); switch (a[0].ToUpper()) &#123; case &quot;PARAM1&quot;: PARAMETER.Param1 = a[1]; break; case &quot;PARAM2&quot;: PARAMETER.Param1 = a[1]; break; default: break; &#125; &#125; DoSomething ds = new DoSomething(); ds.Work(PARAMETER.Param1); ds.MoreWork(PARAMETER.Param2); &#125;&#125; The LoggingNow we have our pretty senseless app and we want to log the jobs of the worker class. First, we have to implement a global variable for holding the log messages and secondly a small method to simplify the handling of the log: Program.cs12345678910111213static public class Main &#123; ... static StringBuilder LOGDATA = new StringBuilder(); public static void Log(params string[] args) &#123; var msg = string.Join(&quot; &quot;, args).TrimEnd(); LOGDATA.AppendLine(msg); &#125; &#125; The Log methods gets an infinite number of arguments (ParamArray) to assemble a message to log. This we can use now in our worker class: DoSomething.cs1234567891011121314public class DoSomething&#123; public void Work(string param1) &#123; //... doing heavy work with param1 Main.Log(&quot;Heavy work done with result&quot;, &quot;SUCCESS&quot;); &#125; public void MoreWork(string param2) &#123; //... doing more work with param2 Main.Log(&quot;More work done with result&quot;, &quot;SUCCESS&quot;); &#125;&#125; You can use Main.Log(...) wherever you want, because its globally available. Writing the log fileLast, but not least, we have to persist the log messages into a file. This should done just before the application ends. For writing the log, we use a StreamWriter object, which accepts our StringBuilder, where the messages are stored in seperate lines. By checking the length of the StringBuilder LOGDATA, we ensure that the log file is only written, when there is something to write. Program.cs123456789101112131415161718192021static public class Main &#123; static public void Start(string[] args) &#123; ... HandleEnd(); &#125; static void HandleEnd() &#123; if (LOGDATA.Length &gt; 0) &#123; string logFile = $&quot;&#123;DateTime.Now.ToString(&quot;u&quot;).Replace(&quot;:&quot;,&quot;-&quot;)&#125;.log&quot;; string logFilePath = Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, logFile); StreamWriter logStream = new StreamWriter(logFilePath, true, Encoding.UTF8); logStream.Write(LOGDATA); logStream.Close(); &#125; &#125;&#125; That’s it. As you see, the important parts are the globally available StringBuilder and the persistance of the messages in a file at the end. With this you can customize the messages as fancy as you want and you don’t need one of the logging beasts.

To me it is obvious that software manufacturers cannot support every operating system, but I can expect that if they support a particular OS, they will do so on any hardware that the OS manufacturer also supports! What has happened…I have similar hardware as described above, but with a gap: a Windows tablet. I have one with Android and manage my synchronization with a tool called DropSync, but due to limited disc space I can’t sync bigger projects with thousands of files, like this blog. Whenever I want to continue writing an article on the road, I download the corresponding MD file and then upload it again afterwards. A bit cumbersome. Since the first appearance of Microsoft’s Surface several years ago, I thought this type of hardware, which includes the same OS I’m using all the time - Windows - could be close my device gap and a couple of days ago, I put a bunch of Euros in the hand of a local dealer to finally close it with a Surface Pro X. 256GB SSD, 16GB RAM and the size of a sheet of paper should be good to work on stuff while on the road. As with any new piece of hardware, I began to install my setup, essential tools that I use very often. This included Dropbox, of course … with an unexpected result. While all the tools installed without a murmur, Dropbox bitched by saying that my device is not compatible with this version of the Dropbox client and that I should install the Dropbox S Mode app via the Windows Store instead. Yes sure, a Surface has an ARM processor instead of an x32&#x2F;x64 from Intel or AMD, but what’s the problem? Every single tool in my list works with Windows 10 under ARM64, at least in 32-bit emulation, but not Dropbox? To say it loud and clear: the UWP app “Dropbox S Mode” is a disgrace! Not only does it use a technology that Microsoft is just saying goodbye to, no, it also offers less functionality than the actual Dropbox website. Folders cannot be downloaded as a whole, but only individual files, and a synchronization of some kind has been completely omitted. The thing is really just dirt. This kind of software is for grannies who already have a hard time holding a mouse, but not for power users, with several gigabytes of data! I don’t let something like that sit on me so easily, but tried to find a trick via some research how to get the Dropbox client to work under ARM after all. And on Dropbox’s own forum alone, I found a bunch of posts on the topic: Is Windows 10 on ARM going to be compatible with the Dropbox desktop app? Can I have the desktop app installed on my Surface Pro X? Dropbox client for Windows 11 ARM? Can’t install the desktop app on a new PC The oldest post I have found here was from 2019. Dropbox, you are not able to port your code to ARM within at least 3 years and the only answer you have for your paying users is buy a regular computer. Are you nuts? Are you begging to go under or be bought by one of the big fish due to management incompetence? New Dropbox features like Paper, Capture or Replay are nice ones, but whenever a company neglects its base, the reason why became big, it is close to the abyss. Best examples are Lego and Marvel. A New StartI was aware of OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) since it was launched 2007, as Microsoft tried to counter the success of Dropbox, but it had its pitfalls and wasn’t running so fluffy as the original. 15 years later, you can hardly resist the sync software from Redmont, because it is always included in everything that has Windows on it, but it has also become decisively better and more stable. The ARM disaster of Dropbox has now moved me to switch to OneDrive. I’m writing this article on my Surface tablet right now, and whenever I press CTRL-S, OneDrive syncs the MD file to my other machines. At the end of the day, we’re all about one thing: Convenience, and if you don’t meet that standard (or abuse it), you die. Good Luck Dropbox …","categories":[{"name":"Misc","slug":"Misc","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Misc/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Rant","slug":"Rant","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Rant/"}]},{"title":"Discoveries #18 - JS UI","subtitle":null,"series":"Discoveries","date":"2022-05-10","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Discoveries-18-JS-UI/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Discoveries-18-JS-UI/","excerpt":"This months Discoveries it’s all about Web UI driven by JavaScript.

At that time, he began writing a Chrome extension that would report a newly received Gmail by means of a small icon in the extension bar of the browser and display it directly in a separate pop-up window by clicking on it. The result was Checker Plus for Gmail. In addition to the extension for Gmail, Savard offers others for Calendar and Drive and all of them have one thing in common: You can do the most important functions of the services directly in the popup that opens: Reply to mail, write new mail, create appointment with reminder, upload file, get file link to share - Everything works without having to load the services’ interfaces in a browser window. For the author and probably some of the almost 2 million users, the Checker Plus extensions are the kind of tools you can’t imagine working without them - that’s how quickly you get used to the functionality and adapt your own workflow to it. Checker Plus for Gmail: Impressive range of functionsThe Checker Plus tool for the web mailer Gmail places an icon in the extension bar that displays the number of unread mails by means of an indicator. Since it is possible to configure several Gmail accounts in the extension, all unread mails are summarised in the number. If you click on the icon, a pop-up opens with a clear list of all accounts and the unread mails. The mails are displayed in compact mode, i.e. in addition to the sender and the subject, you also see an excerpt from the mail text. If you now click on a mail, it is displayed in full in the popout and also takes any mail thread into account. The icon buttons Archive, Mark Spam, Delete, Mark Read and Mark, which are displayed when hovering over a mail, represent the most frequently used actions and usually make it unnecessary to use the Open in Gmail button. Massive Setting OptionsOver the years and with each new version (currently v22.9), countless options have been added, so that Savard had to divide them into nine groups, including the start page: Start Page with Quick Access General Notifications Do not disturb Button Accounts&#x2F;Labels Skins and Themes Keys Voice Input It would be foolish, to go into all the settings in this article, but a few deserve an extra portion of attention, such as those under Accounts&#x2F;Labels. Here, users can decide whether the extension should determine the available Gmail accounts itself based on the login to Gmail saved in the browser or whether they should specify them manually. In both cases, it is then possible to select only certain labels for the notifications or to leave it at the standard inbox. This is very usefull if you have set up a system of automatic distribution to subfolders (labels). Since the extensions also control the interactive desktop notifications, it is useful to be able to define periods of time under Do Not Disturb, when this is not to happen. In addition to the option of using dates from the Google Calendar, you can also define weekly schedules for this purpose. Checker Plus for Google Calendar: Better than the originalThe icon of the Chrome extension for Google Calendar visually warns of upcoming appointments and displays those for the next two days in the tooltip. If you sit at your computer all day and work in the Chrome browser, you can hardly talk your way out of missing an appointment, especially since the extension also takes over warnings via the Windows notification system. The pop-up’s interface is similar to the original at calendar.google.com, merely placing the sidebar under a hamburger menu to save space. It replicates the basic functionality of the original and there is little reason to visit the original Google website when using it. But it also does a few things better than Google. For example, the pop-up offers the same view options as day, month, week, year and appointment overview, but calls the latter a list and adds an overview as known from the Calendar Android app. In addition, you can define your own view in the settings, for example, if you want to keep an eye on the next three days or six weeks. The current version v26.1.1 of Checker Plus for Google Calendar also has a lot of setting options, such as displaying the week numbers or marking the weekends. Particularly noteworthy here are the settings for notifications, which can be fine-tuned very well across multiple accounts and calendars. Checker Plus for Google Drive: Fewer functionsThe pop-up of the Drive extension is basically a copy of the Google interface at drive.google.com. It is limited to the list form and does without previews of the files, but also without advertisements, such as “Buy storage space”. It also has nowhere near as many options in the context menu of a folder or file as the original, but this can generally be gotten over because the most important options such as download, copy link, rename and remove are available. Additional functions against donationFew Chrome extensions are as close to the needs of users as the Checker Plus extensions. The functional scope of the Gmail extension in particular is simply impressive and leaves hardly anything to be desired. Only when it comes to localising the source code in currently more than 30 languages, Savard could take a little more care. Sometimes a little English gets mixed into otherwise German interfaces, especially in the settings. But any developer who has ever tried to offer his tool in so many languages will forgive him, because he knows the amount of work involved. Unfortunately, the settings area Skins and Themes is everything but generally understandable and no comparison to the otherwise good UX of the extensions. If you want to make the pop-up pretty with background images and other colours, you have to read up and understand Jason’s concept of individualising separate elements. Since Jason Savard now works full time on his extensions, he is dependent on income to be generated from them. He has declared some settings, which he says he worked on for a long time, as “additional functions” that you get if you donate an amount of money to him once or monthly. A fair concept, especially since he guarantees daily updates and even a response time of five minutes in case of problems. Well ;) But it’s nice to see a developer who puts so much heart and soul into his work.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Browser","slug":"Browser","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Browser/"},{"name":"Plugin","slug":"Plugin","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Plugin/"},{"name":"Mail","slug":"Mail","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Mail/"}]},{"title":"Discoveries #16 - JavaScript","subtitle":null,"series":"Discoveries","date":"2022-01-29","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Discoveries-16-JavaScript/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Discoveries-16-JavaScript/","excerpt":"In the first discoveries of 2022 I would like to offer you some interesting links to JavaScript articles that have general language features as their topic or extend them in a clever way.

The “break” from one column to the next doesn’t respect the full 10px high shadow of the next item. It breaks too late. You will get something like this: I added a red shadow on hover, to make the bug more obvious. See following pen to inspect the CSS. In case you use Firefox (Version 96.x as of today), you won’t see the bug, because Mozilla did it right. WorkaroundStep 1In order to achieve a proper result, we have to hack the HTML and the CSS a bit. First of all we have to wrap the content of an item with a new element called ìtem-inner: 123456&lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;item-inner&quot;&gt; Box 1 &lt;img style=&quot;height:53px&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Step 2Next, we move the width, the border and the box-shadow from the item itself to the new inner element. Important here is, to set the background of the item element to transparent in order to prevent interfering with the shadow. 123456789101112131415161718192021:root &#123; --gap: 20px; --gap-half: calc(var(--gap) / 2); --color-border: hsl(0 0% 90%);&#125;.item &#123; /* BASIC STYLES */ background-color: transparent;&#125;.item-inner &#123; /* BASIC STYLES */ background-color: #fffaf5; border: 1px var(--color-border) solid; box-shadow: 1px 2px var(--gap-half) 5px var(--color-border); transition: all ease-out 0.3s; /* LAYOUT STYLES */ width: 200px; padding: 15px; overflow: hidden;&#125; Step 3Now we have to set the wrapper‘s gap to 0, because we will implement the spacing of the items by applying different paddings to the item element: half of the gap to be reached, to the left, the right and the bottom padding and the full gap to the top. The latter, to achieve pushing the previous element far enough away so as not to see anything of the shadow. But because this would mean that the horizontal gap would be too large by half, we have to use a negative margin to pull the element up by that amount. This in turn would mean, that the first item element in the list would be too high by the now defined negative top margin, which we correct again by using item:first-child. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223:root &#123; --gap: 20px; --gap-half: calc(var(--gap) / 2); /* ... more variables */&#125;.wrapper &#123; /* ...more styles */ column-gap: 0;&#125;.item &#123; /* ... BASIC STYLES */ /* LAYOUT STYLES */ width: auto; margin: var(--gap-half-negative) 0 0; padding: var(--gap) var(--gap-half) var(--gap-half); /* COLUMN STYLES */ break-inside: avoid-column;&#125;.item:first-child &#123; margin-top: 0;&#125; Here is the complete solution as a pen: ConclusionMaybe the Chromium team will fix the bug as soon as possible, to no longer have to rely on this hack, but the really best solution would be, to finish the work already started on the true grid masonry, which currently only Firefox offers behind a flag.

Because the Mardown syntax is limited for good reason, Hexo has tag plugins you can use in your content to simplify and centralize complex structures, instead of writing pure HTML. For more information, see hexo.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tag-plugins. This project is a growing collection of tag plugins that I have developed and use for my blog kiko.io. Some of them are quite simple, others are more complex, but overall maybe helpful for you. Installation &#x2F; UsingThere is no automatic installation of all tag plugins via NPM or other package managers, because every tag plugin stands for itself and you can pick the one you need simply by copying the appropriate JS file into your Hexo’s script folder: THEMES &#x2F; &lt;YOUR-THEME&gt; &#x2F; SCRIPTS. For every tag plugin in the list below I provide a Visual Studio Code Snippet to quickly insert a plugin into the content via the hotkey Ctrl+Space. To use the snippest create a new .code-snippets file in your projects .vscode folder and insert the snippets of all tag plugins you have downloaded into your project. Parameter Description SyntaxEvery tag plugin includes a description in the header how to use it. The syntax is as follows: Syntax Description param1 mandatory parameter [param2] optional parameter [param2=default] optional parameter with default value param:(option1,option2) parameter option list to choose one option ...&quot;value1|value2&quot; pipe delimitered array of values Plugins Anchor Anchorlist Alertbox Alternative Blockquote Blockquote Details Codepen CodeSandbox Download Link Github Readme GitHub User &amp; Repo Card Image Compare Image Link Image Slide Indiepen More Info AnchorA simple anchor element as A- or HR-Tag as jump target for example from a Anchorlist.

It is also possible to calculate the new image using hexagons instead of classic triangles. tns({ container: \"#image-slide-m846l1\", items: 1, slideBy: \"page\", controls: false, nav: true }); The result is stylized images of the original, which can be used as a chic desktop background, for example. Due to the abstraction of the actual motif, such images are also very suitable as header images on websites, such as blogs, if the image should not distract from the actual content. Such an image has a great closeness to the original, but looks more like art. Besides PNG, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is also available as output format, which makes sense because SVG is an XML format and the polygons calculated by the program can also be written away directly as corresponding polygon entries as text. The generated SVG files are thereby smaller by a factor of 30, depending on the original, and thus fit in many places much better with tight bandwidths or used-up consumption limits on the Internet. Using Triangula on the command lineRyan offers his program Triangula also as CLI version, which is called via the command line. The process of triangulating is separated into two parts: First you create the desired abstraction of an original image via the parameter run, which is stored in a JSON file on the hard disk and in a second step you create either a PNG or an SVG as output file via render and the specification of the JSON file. Since the command line tool has the same options as the UI version, it is great for automating the processing of the images used when building a website, for example. It also makes it much easier to turn an entire folder of images into such artistic abstractions. Using triangulated images as placeholders on websitesDepending on how good the Internet connection is and how well the developers brain of a website has worked, it can take a while until the browser of the smartphone has loaded the x-megabyte header or illustration image to finally be able to display it. It gets really annoying when no space has been reserved on the website for the image beforehand and the text that you have started to read suddenly jumps away. In any case, the solution is to always use images that are as small as possible and adapted to the device, but they still have a certain file size if they are to look good. To prevent text jumping, nowadays one usually uses gray placeholders with or without loading bars to signal to the user that something will be displayed at this point shortly. Ryan has found an amazingly effective solution for this as well: tip - Triagulated Placeholders - creating the smallest possible triangulated images and blending them using JavaScript. The basis is a frontend, also written in Go, which uses the same algorithms as Triangula and with which the user can process several original images or an entire folder of photos at once via the interface. The output format from tip is not PNG or SVG, but a binary file, which consumes the least amount of memory of all technical possibilities. For comparison the generated file sizes of the example image with resolution 1024 x 660: Image Size Original 386 KB Triangula PNG 223 KB Triangula SVG 40,3 KB tip TRI 3,03 KB These files, with the extension TRI, are referenced by the web developer in the IMG tag of an image on a page in the data-src attribute, and a JavaScript, only 200 lines long, which is also included and delivered with the web page, takes care of immediately displaying this TRI file when the page is loaded and smoothly fading to the original image once it has been loaded. You can hardly make it more beautiful.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Imaging","slug":"Imaging","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Imaging/"},{"name":"SVG","slug":"SVG","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/SVG/"}]},{"title":"Discoveries #14","subtitle":null,"series":"Discoveries","date":"2021-11-20","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Discoveries-14/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Discoveries-14/","excerpt":"In this month discoveries you will find some posts and pens regarding CSS and its possibilities.

It took until 2021… github.dev and Github CodespacesIn Juli 2021 GitHub announced the availability of github.dev and GitHub Codespaces. The main difference between these two solutions is that Codespaces runs the IDE within a container (VM) in the background, which enables you to run your project and … it is only available for paid plans. The main purpose of github.dev is to serve as a call target of the so-called Magic Dot, an easy way to open any repository in an editor. I blogged about this capabilty a while ago, see GitHubs Magic Dot. Really amazing! Just press the dot key on every repository and you can browse the code files. vscode.devRecently, in October 2021, Microsoft (who owns GitHub) announced another online VS Code called vscode.dev. It is practically the same IDE as github.dev, with one main difference: It is not bound to a GitHub repository, but is able to open any local project or even remote repositories from GitHub. However, it also has the same limitation that you cannot run a project, because there is no VM running in the background. But it is a really neat online editor, which runs on mobile devices too and feels absolutely like a local installed VS Code. GitpodBack in 2017 some developers from Kiel, Germany started a web-based platform called Gitpod for providing fully functional orchestrated developer environments in the web. Since at that time VS Code was not yet running in the browser, they started the project Eclipse Theia, which powers several online IDE’s until today, but switched to VS Code as the team around Erich Gamma announced remote development capabilities in late 2020. Whats special about Gitpod is, that users are able to start a browser-based instance of the IDE just by adding the address of an GitHub repository as a parameter to the URL, like https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/kristofzerbe/kiko.io. Gitpot then starts a container with the source code and shows up the IDE at a random URL like https://coffee-squirrel-htamfigy.ws-eu18.gitpod.io. This so called Workspaces can be stopped, resumed, shared and downloaded, because it is a container with everything in it you need to run. Really amazing! Other Monaco-driven IDE’sVS Code actually consists of two parts: the platform itself, called Code-OSS, and the code editor Monaco included in it, which is also available as a separate project and used by other web-based IDE’s, like the following… StackblitzThe IDE on stackblitz.com is mainly useful for web frontend developers. You can easily create Angular, React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt or even plain JavaScript or static HTML projects and connect them to an new repository on GitHub. But … you can’t load existing projects from GitHub into Stackblitz on the fly, you have to import them. What makes Stackblitz very comfortable is that it runs your frontend directly on their servers and gives it to you in a browser-like preview window via a random Url like https://web-platform-ywqj4s.stackblitz.io, you can open up in a separate browser also. CodeSandboxCodeSandbox works similar to Stackblitz, but offers some more features, like deployment to Vercel, Netlify or GitHub Pages and a test runner. Also, you have full control over the sandbox that runs the preview of your project and the ability to invite other developers or visitors to the project, which makes it perfect for online coding seminars e.g. classrooms.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"VS Code","slug":"VS-Code","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/VS-Code/"}]},{"title":"Croatian Presets for Lightroom","subtitle":null,"series":"Lightroom Presets","date":"2021-10-16","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Croatian-Presets-for-Lightroom/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Croatian-Presets-for-Lightroom/","excerpt":"Staying in Croatia is always a joy, in summer but also in winter.

The first step on implementing every image gallery solution is the installation. Spotlight has different options, but the easiest one is to download the bundled version, which includes both the JS files and the image (icon) and CSS files. For the non-bundles files, you can choose the minified versions or even the original ES6 and LESS files. There is a NPM package also. For the implementation you can either choose a declarative way using the spotlight class, where the shown thumb images to click on needs to have a wrapper… 123456&lt;a class=&quot;spotlight&quot; href=&quot;img1.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;thumb1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;spotlight&quot; href=&quot;img2.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;thumb2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; … or programmatically via JavaScript: 12345var gallery = [ &#123; src: &quot;img1.jpg&quot; &#125;, &#123; src: &quot;img2.jpg&quot; &#125;];Spotlight.show(gallery /*, options */); Next to the image, at the bottom left corner, a title, a description and&#x2F;or a button can be displayed on a gallery slide, which is completely compatible with all types of devices. It is possible to define image groups to show separately in the declaration mode by having an extra wrapper around a bunch of image wrappers. All options how the gallery has to be shown are also declarative: 123456789101112&lt;div class=&quot;spotlight-group&quot; data-title=&quot;Group title&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;spotlight&quot; href=&quot;img1.jpg&quot; data-title=&quot;This is a title&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;thumb1.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;spotlight&quot; href=&quot;img2.jpg&quot; data-title=&quot;This is another title&quot; data-description=&quot;This is a description&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;thumb2.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Spotlight has 9 built-in controls to show in the bar at the top left: Fullscreen Zoom in Zoom out Autofit Close Theme Play (Slideshow) Download … and there is a possibility to insert custom controls during initialization. If you provide several image sizes, Spotlight picks the optimal version regarding the current devices resolution, pixel ratio and bandwidth. But Spotlight is not limited to images. It can also display videos and even custom HTML fragments (DOM nodes) as slides. Through its JavaScript API you can fully remote control the gallery and it has several options to customize the appearance of the slides to every need you can imagine. The implementation is a breeze. It took me less than 10 minutes to get Spotlight working here on this blog at the photo page! I can’t think of any use case right now, that you couldn’t implement easily and quickly with this amazing library.

Wrong … after commiting my changes to Github, where my blog is living, and checking my RSS feed a while after, I saw this: Three empty posts…!? The indiepen files in the asset subfolder were treated like posts by Hexo by no obvious reason! A short research on the web lead me to a Github issue called asset files were rendered when post_asset_folder set to true from 2015, with several requests to fix the bug. Since I’m little familiar with Hexo’s processors, I saw two ways to fix the problem: Write a plugin like Hexo Hide Posts to filter out unwanted “posts” after processing Try to find the problem in Hexo’s source code, to avoid these files to be treated as posts a priori After a little searching around in Hexo’s source code, I was able to identify the location where the problem was. In the post processor: ./node_modules/hexo/lib/plugins/processor/post.js (shortened)1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738module.exports = ctx =&gt; &#123; ... return &#123; pattern: new Pattern(path =&gt; &#123; if (isTmpFile(path)) return; let result; if (path.startsWith(postDir)) &#123; result = &#123; published: true, path: path.substring(postDir.length) &#125;; &#125; else if (path.startsWith(draftDir)) &#123; result = &#123; published: false, path: path.substring(draftDir.length) &#125;; &#125; if (!result || isHiddenFile(result.path)) return; result.renderable = ctx.render.isRenderable(path) &amp;&amp; !isMatch(path, ctx.config.skip_render); return result; &#125;), process: function postProcessor(file) &#123; if (file.params.renderable) &#123; return processPost(file); &#125; else if (ctx.config.post_asset_folder) &#123; return processAsset(file); &#125; &#125; &#125;;&#125;;... In the very beginning of processing posts, the code iterates over all files and folders in the _posts folder and creates a param object for each by using the pattern. This object has an attribute named renderable, which is used by the process method later on, to decide if it has to be rendered or not. But … the determination of renderable is based solely on wether a file has a renderer (isRenderable) or if it is listed in the skip_render configuration. See line 24 in the sample code. As HTML, JS and CSS files naturally have a renderer in Hexo, they will treated as posts! Alleviation Of The ProblemIn this early stage of code execution, only files and folders are listed. There is no reference to a post or something like that, in order to find out if a certain file belongs to a post as an asset. Examination of the path will fail, because it is possible in Hexo to have a folder hierarchy under _posts. The only way to approach the problem solution is by making assumptions: If the user has activated the configuration post_asset_folder, he wants to have asset files in a folder named after the post If the user has configured a certain file name for new posts in new_post_name (for example :title.md), it is not to be assumed, that he will create asset files with the same file extension. Important here is, that it is not an option to hide the files in some way, because then they won’t appear in the website. They have to be marked as process it, but don’t render it, by bending the renderable attribute. These considerations led to a small extension of the above code below line 24: ./node_modules/hexo/lib/plugins/processor/post.js (shortened)12345678910...result.renderable = ctx.render.isRenderable(path) &amp;&amp; !isMatch(path, ctx.config.skip_render);//if post_asset_folder is set, restrict renderable files to default file extension if (result.renderable &amp;&amp; ctx.config.post_asset_folder) &#123; result.renderable = (extname(ctx.config.new_post_name) === extname(path));&#125;... This is what I pushed as a Pull Request to the Hexo team today. I know, it not ideal, but maybe they accept my approach and ship the fix with the next version.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"Blogging","slug":"Blogging","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Blogging/"}]},{"title":"Photo Workflow Re-Thought","subtitle":null,"series":"Step By Step","date":"2021-09-12","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Photo-Workflow-Re-Thought/","excerpt":"To be honest: many of my posts here on kiko.io are written just for me.

It is important to use a SD card that is as big and as fast, in terms if writing speed, as the used XQD card!

In the end, always 2 different backups will exist on different media. When traveling, it is important to always have the tablet and the card reader with you, in addition to the camera and some spare SD cards. Step 1Whenever it is necessary or advisable, take both cards out of the camera and put the XQD card into the card reader and connect the latter to the tablet. Just put the SD card away, as we will use a spare card afterwards. Open up Solid Explorer on the tablet… Copy the complete folder DCIM/101ND500 (where the photos are stored) to a separate folder called RAW on the disk (SD card extension) of the tablet. Step 2Rename the new folder on the disk to something appropriate:(Screenshot says Rename a file, but that’s a bug in the app) Step 3Insert the XQD card and a spare SD card back into the camera and wipe them both via the built-in menu. Your backup is now on the orginal SD cards and your tablet. Step 4 (optional)If you have time and leisure, you can use Photo Mate R3 to review and rate your images. Don’t delete any photos in this step!Just mark photos with RED, which can be removed afterwards, because the app is sometimes not fast enough to delete the right photo, when you has opened the next one! Step 5Open up Dropsync on the tablet and set up a new sync profile, if you haven’t done so already: The remote folder is a folder called RAW in your Dropbox and the local folder is the RAW folder on your disk. Sync method should be Upload then delete, because you don’t need the second backup on your tablet, after the photos are transfered to Dropbox. Run the synchronization: Your backup is now on the original SD cards and Dropbox. Step 6After you have enjoyed your trip and be back home, move the photo folder from your Dropbox to your local storage, which of course should also have a backup of some kind: Your backup is now on the original SD cards and your local storage. Step 7If you’ve already rated your images along the way, Photo Mate R3 has already stored that metadata in an XMP sidecar file, that is compatible with Lightroom: Open up Lightroom and import the folder from your local storage: Step 8In the Lightroom library, filter all photos with the RED flag and set them as REJECTED: Step 9Delete all photos marked as REJECTED: Step 10If you are sure that your local backup was done once, you can safely wipe the original SD cards, in order to use them for the next time.","categories":[{"name":"Photo-Editing","slug":"Photo-Editing","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Photo-Editing/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Lightroom","slug":"Lightroom","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Lightroom/"},{"name":"Imaging","slug":"Imaging","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Imaging/"},{"name":"Workflow","slug":"Workflow","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Workflow/"}]},{"title":"Application-Specific Links on Windows 10","subtitle":"What works and what we still have to wait for","date":"2021-09-03","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Application-Specific-Links-on-Windows-10/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Application-Specific-Links-on-Windows-10/","excerpt":"While reading the Chris Coyier’s post Application-Specific Links the other day, I realized what has been bugging me for a long time now: a proper solution for openening a certain URL in a modern Web App. Since the beginning of the digital age (feels like that), we have files associated to a certain application, installed on our machine, regardless if its running Windows, iOS, OS&#x2F;2 or whatever.

The question is, how to associate not only files, but links with certain desktop apps? Executables and URL SchemesTriggered by Notions announcement of using a dedicated link protocol notion:// to open up Notion links directly in the Notion App, Chris wrote about the possibilities an a Mac to associate certain URL schemes with a Web App in general. His choice fell on Choosy, an app which hooks into to the process on opening links by beeing the systems default browser and forwarding the URL to configured applications. Fair enough, but it’s a tool for Mac. However, it was not particularly difficult to find equivalent programs for Windows 10, my preferred OS: Browser Selector Browser Select Browser Picker Browser Choose 2 … name yours Interestingly, Microsoft already has something similar built into Windows, but prevents users from messing with it: The feature is targeted from UWP applications only, therefore the developer has to implement it by extending the app manifest: Web-to-App Linking with AppUriHandlers. What Chris’ approach and all similar Windows programs have in common is, that they are based on executables, EXE files and yes, the cross-platform apps mentioned above are executables, but for me this is too short. What about Chromium based Progressive Web Apps (PWA)? Since the Chromium team has introduced the possibility to add a website as desktop shortcut and start it in a new window, without any browser specific toolbars and other stuff, it became very popular, especially if this website was implemented by the developer as a PWA.It does not matter whether all PWA features, such as offline mode or similar, are available. The mere fact of being able to use an online service in its own window is a gain. But such an app has no specific executable! It will be executed by the browser with some parameters itself. The question is, how to associate a certain URL scheme or a custom protocol with these web apps? PWA’s on WindowsSome basics about how Chromium based browsers are dealing with this feature: As you click on Create Shortcut… in the More Tools menu in Chrome or Edge and confirm the following dialog (or install the PWA), a new folder in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Web Applications will be created. Its name starts with _crx_ and is followed by a random string (so called app-id), f.e. ffokdlainpppngbbhdcobaocmbobgdii. In this folder the Favicon of the website is stored. If it is a real PWA and has a Web App Manifest, you will find all resources defined there in another subfolder named by the app-id below %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Web Applications\\Manifest Resources. The paths differ depending on which browser profile is active. In this case ‘default’. The desktop shortcut, which will be created, points to an executable named chrome_proxy.exe or msedge_proxy.exe. These files are scaled-down versions of the browser executable itself. Its main purpose is to bypass a Windows error as described in its source code, in order to create a correct shortcut. The important part of the shortcut are the calling parameters: --app-id - the random ID generated by the browser --profile-directory - the browser profile to use; mostly ‘default’ If you are interested, Chromium has dozens of parameters, some to change the behaviour and others only for debugging purposes. Peter Beverloo provides an automatic generated List of all Chromium Command Line Switches. … a bit deeper, just for funThe following has nothing to do with the actual problem and doesn’t help in any way, but it was interesting to dig a bit deeper into the operating principles of Chromium.

Registering Protocol Handlers via JavaScriptThere are native protocol handlers in every OS. The most famous is mailto:. A click on such a link opens the default mail editor. Since 2006 the W3C discusses an extension called registerProtocolHandler, every web app could implement to tell the OS, that it is responsible for a certain protocol. 123navigator.registerProtocolHandler(&quot;web+myfancyapp&quot;, &quot;https://my-fancy-web-app.com/?url=%s&quot;, &quot;My Fancy App Handler&quot;); If this registrations as the user enters the site for the first time, he will be asked by the browser for allowance, he has to confirm to make it work. As the developer implements the links, he has to write it like that: 1&lt;a href=&quot;web+myfancyapp:settings&quot;&gt;Go To Settings&lt;/a&gt; The registration and a click on such a link causes the browser to request https://my-fancy-web-app.com/?url=settings. For understandable reasons some protocols are blacklisted, like mailto, irc, tel and others. Custom protocol schemes has to have the prefix web+, in order to avoid interference with the standardized protocols. As of May 2021, it is part of the capabilities project and is in development currently. Nice … but doesn’t helps in solving our problem in the first place, because we can’t yet break out of the browser with it. We need something to tell the browser that an installed PWA is responsible for this protocol… Manifest Protocol HandlersThere is no official W3C proposal, but experiments around the Chromium team to extend the PWA’s manifest file like that: web.manifest123456&quot;protocol_handlers&quot;: [ &#123; &quot;protocol&quot;: &quot;web+myfancyapp&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;/?url=%s&quot; &#125;] This could be the bridge we need to bind a PWA to a certain protocol, in order to open up the registered browser app, instead of a new tab. But its is just an experiment. Manifest URL HandlersAnother approach on connecting certain links to a PWA is similar to the manifests protocol_handlers but for URL schemes. No need for registering a protocol … browser just parse the URL and show up my app: web.manifest12345678&quot;url_handlers&quot; : [ &#123; &quot;origin&quot;: &quot;https://my-fancy-app.com&quot; &#125;, &#123; &quot;origin&quot;: &quot;https://*.my-fancy-app.com&quot; &#125;] Simple and straightforward. There is a Chrome Platform Page for this feature and the current status is Origin Trial for version 93! To try it out, you can enable #enable-desktop-pwas-url-handling in Edge and Chrome: But … it is also not even on the way to an official proposal :| ConclusionAs of today there is no solution for Windows users to associate links with the bunch of different applicationson windows, as we are used to from the files. But there is a special technique regarding web apps at the horizon, zo ease this pain, even if it depends on the app developers. Maybe Microsoft should think about their approach of Apps for Websites, in order to make it possible for users to extend that. The cherry on top would be then, if they decide to integrate the upcoming Protocol and URL Handlers, defined by the developers, right into this tool.

The starting point of my example is the requirement to display several elements of the same type on a dynamic page, but you can of course adapt the example according to your needs. The PageFirst of all we need a Hexo page for the meta data and for some text we want to show at the beginning of the page to describe what is shown below. In order not to interfer the classic post generation, we create a new folder in Hexo’s source folder called _dynamic, where we place the MD file for the new dynamic page. The underscore in the name of the folder _dynamic is important, because Hexo doesn’t touch subfolders in source with this starting character while generating the site. Without, it would be treated as a normal page. ./source/_dynamic/my-special-page.md123456789---title: My Titlesubtitle: My Subtitledate: 2021-08-24 19:24:00mySpecialProperty: &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet&quot;---Some text to show above the dynamic created content... The Frontmatter data has no limits. You can add as much properties as you like. The Layout TemplateHexo works with EJS layout files. Whenever a page should be created, the calling method has to define which layout file should be used. Therefor we create a special EJS file for our dynamic page and place it in the layout folder. ./themes/&lt;your-theme&gt;/layout/my-special-layout.ejs1234567891011121314151617&lt;h1 class=&quot;page-title&quot;&gt;&lt;%= page.title %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;page-subtitle&quot;&gt;&lt;%= page.subtitle %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;page-content&quot;&gt; &lt;%- page.content %&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;view grid&quot;&gt; &lt;% for(var i=0; i &lt; page.items.length; i++) &#123; %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;_partial/my-special-item&#x27;, &#123; item: page.items[i] &#125;) %&gt; &lt;% &#125; %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt; // Extend the page with JavaScript ...&lt;/script&gt; On generating the page later on, an object called page will be used to process the EJS, with all information we want to show on the page, like content (text of the Markdown file) and all meta data from the Frontmatter (title, subtitle and so on). Special attention is paid to items, because this property holds the list of all items we want to show on the page. Each object in this list have multiple custom properties you define, when you are assemble the data to show in the generator, but more about that later. In the script tag you can write JavaScript to interact with your data on the page, like filtering stuff or other things the user should can do with your data. The Partial Template For ItemsIn order not to blow up the layout EJS, it is advisable to separate the template for the item itself to an extra file, referenced in the layout file (_partial/my-special-item) as a Partial. ./themes/&lt;your-theme&gt;/layout/_partial/my-special-item.ejs123&lt;div class=&quot;my-item&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- Definition of an item --&gt;&lt;/div&gt; The layout EJS will iterate over the list of items in the FOR loop and handover one of these object to the Partial to render. The GeneratorAs we have made our preparations, we are now able to implement our special generator itself. Hexo uses so called Generators to “produce” the HTML for your site and you can add your own by using the register method. The result of a generator has to be an object with at least three properties: data - Data object with all necessary information to process the given layout EJS path - The path where the HTML file should be created layout - The layout EJS file, which should be processed ./themes/&lt;your-theme&gt;/scripts/my-special-generator.js123456789101112131415161718hexo.extend.generator.register(&quot;my-special-generator&quot;, async function(locals) &#123; // INSTANTIATE A NEW DATA OBJECT let page = &#123;&#125;; page.name = &quot;my-special-page&quot;; // Do something to get content and data for the page // INSTANTIATE THE RESULT OBJECT let result = &#123; data: page, path: path.join(page.name, &quot;index.html&quot;), layout: &quot;my-special-layout&quot; &#125; // RETURN THE RESULT return result; &#125;); In this basic structure, you will find again the layout file, we created earlier. The output will be rendered in an HTML file called index.html at the subfolder my-special-page, as we take the name of the page for it, as we did it for the name of the source MD file. The next thing we have to implement here, is the content of the source MD file. The parameter locals gives you access to the site variables, with all information about the site and its pages, posts, categories and tags! The first 4 lines in the following script are the references to some helpers we need. Please be sure, that you install them first via npm install. ./themes/&lt;your-theme&gt;/scripts/my-special-generator.js12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243const log = require(&#x27;hexo-log&#x27;)(&#123; debug: false, silent: false &#125;);const path = require(&#x27;path&#x27;);const fs = require(&#x27;hexo-fs&#x27;);const front = require(&#x27;hexo-front-matter&#x27;);hexo.extend.generator.register(&quot;my-special-generator&quot;, async function(locals) &#123; // GET REFERENCE TO HEXO&#x27;S CONFIGURATION let config = this.config; // SHOW MESSAGE ON GENERATING log.info(&quot;Processing items for dynamic page&quot;); let page = &#123;&#125;; page.name = &quot;my-special-page&quot;; // GET THE PATH TO THE SOURCE FILE const mdSource = path.join(config.source_dir, &quot;_dynamic&quot;, page.name + &quot;.md&quot;); // GET THE CONTENT OF THE SOURCE FILE const md = fs.readFileSync(mdSource); // PARSE THE FRONTMATTER OF THE SOURCE FILE let fm = front.parse(md); // ADD THE FRONTMATTER TO THE DATA OBJECT page = &#123;...page, ...fm&#125;; // CONVERT MARKDOWN CONTENT OF THE SOURCE FILE INTO HTML page.content = hexo.render.renderSync(&#123; text: page._content, engine: &#x27;markdown&#x27; &#125;); // Do something to get items data for the page //page.items = []; //... let result = &#123; data: page, path: path.join(page.name, &quot;index.html&quot;), layout: &quot;my-special-layout&quot; &#125; return result; &#125;); The only thing missing now, is your implemention of filling page.items with a list of objects you want to show on the page. There are no limits to your imagination. Get data from external API’s or process JSON data, stored in the data folder … or whatever you prefer.

Especially when utilizing a bunch of libraries and frameworks, bundling is some sort of a must. The offer on bundlers and task runners is large on the web: WebPack, Snowpack, Browserify, Parcel, Grunt, Gulp and “DingDong” (just replace with the hotest new shit available). But, it is not always necessary to replace your complete building pipeline, when the new “DingDong” is hyped in the media. Brave old tools like Gulp are doing their job pretty well … and you are able to integrate some more modern approaches on bundling JS, for example. I couple of months ago, while working on a private project, I became attentive to Rollup.js, a next-generation JavaScript module bundler from Rich Harris, the author of Svelte. Rollup uses the new standardized format for code modules included in the ES6 revision of JavaScript and supports Tree-Shaking, which means that it analyzes all your ES6 imports statements and bundles only the code which is used.

Especially when utilizing a bunch of libraries and frameworks, bundling is some sort of a must. The offer on bundlers and task runners is large on the web: WebPack, Snowpack, Browserify, Parcel, Grunt, Gulp and “DingDong” (just replace with the hotest new shit available). But, it is not always necessary to replace your complete building pipeline, when the new “DingDong” is hyped in the media. Brave old tools like Gulp are doing their job pretty well … and you are able to integrate some more modern approaches on bundling JS, for example. I couple of months ago, while working on a private project, I became attentive to Rollup.js, a next-generation JavaScript module bundler from Rich Harris, the author of Svelte. Rollup uses the new standardized format for code modules included in the ES6 revision of JavaScript and supports Tree-Shaking, which means that it analyzes all your ES6 imports statements and bundles only the code which is used. Pretty cool … but … it is a JavaScript bundler only and there are no plugins for Gulp, my favourite task runner. In this article I will show you, how to integrate Rollup in your Gulp bundling pipeline. Install RollupBest practice is to install Rollup globally: 1npm install --global rollup The Gulp FileStarting point was my gulpfile.js as follows: gulpfile.js1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526const &#123; src, dest, watch, series, parallel &#125; = require(&#x27;gulp&#x27;);const del = require(&#x27;del&#x27;);const cssimport = require(&quot;gulp-cssimport&quot;);const cleancss = require(&#x27;gulp-clean-css&#x27;);const sourcemaps = require(&#x27;gulp-sourcemaps&#x27;);/* Clean distribution folder */function clean() &#123; return del(&#x27;./dist/**&#x27;, &#123; force: true &#125;);&#125;/* Bundle CSS with sourcemapping, imports and cleaning */function css() &#123; return src(&#x27;./styles/app.css&#x27;) .pipe(sourcemaps.init()) .pipe(cssimport(&#123;&#125;)) .pipe(cleancss(&#123; debug: true &#125;, (details) =&gt; &#123; console.log(`$&#123;details.name&#125; BEFORE: $&#123;details.stats.originalSize&#125;`); console.log(`$&#123;details.name&#125; AFTER: $&#123;details.stats.minifiedSize&#125;`); &#125;)) .pipe(sourcemaps.write(&#x27;.&#x27;, &#123; sourceRoot: &#x27;/styles&#x27; &#125;)) .pipe(dest(&#x27;./dist/&#x27;));&#125;exports.default = series(clean, css); This pipeline only bundles CSS yet, when calling gulp in the command line. Calling Rollup for JS bundlingRollup has dozens of parameters to define everything you need, but it also supports a config file, which allows you to configure everything there and run rollup -c only. Very useful on this approach. rollup.config.js12345678export default &#123; input: &#x27;./js/app.js&#x27;, output: &#123; file: &#x27;./dist/app.js&#x27;, format: &#x27;es&#x27;, sourcemap: true &#125;&#125;; As there is no Gulp plugin for Rollup, we need to execute Rollup in the Gulp pipeline by command. For this I’ve created a helper in my gulpfile.js, to be able to execute whichever command: gulpfile.js1234567891011let HELPERS = &#123; execute: (command) =&gt; &#123; const process = exec(command); process.stdout.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (data) =&gt; &#123; console.log(data.toString()); &#125;) process.stderr.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (data) =&gt; &#123; console.log(data.toString()); &#125;) process.on(&#x27;exit&#x27;, (code) =&gt; &#123; console.log(&#x27;Process exited with code &#x27; + code.toString()); &#125;) return process; &#125;&#125; This helper is used in a Gulp command function to call Rollup: gulpfile.js123function javascript() &#123; return HELPERS.execute(&#x27;rollup -c&#x27;);&#125; The last thing I had to do, is to insert the command in the pipeline to run in parallel to the CSS bundling: gulpfile.js1exports.default = series(clean, parallel(css, javascript)); Pretty straightforward, isn’t it? Happy bundling with Rollup and Gulp…","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/"}],"tags":[{"name":"SPA","slug":"SPA","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/SPA/"},{"name":"Bundling","slug":"Bundling","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Bundling/"}]},{"title":"Automatic Duplicate Image Shadow","subtitle":"Drop an image shadow with the image itself via JavaScript","date":"2021-07-16","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Automatic-Duplicate-Image-Shadow/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Automatic-Duplicate-Image-Shadow/","excerpt":"At the beginning of the year I wrote a post about showing a shadow on an image with the image itself instead of using box-shadow, to make the image appear glass-like.

Nice trick, but it would be much easier to have a little script, that does this automatically for all images on a page. In this post I will show you how to achieve this. The script is not really rocket science: We just have to surround an image tag…. 1&lt;img src=&quot;my-image.jpg&quot; /&gt; … with a wrapper, which holds the original image and a blurred duplicate of it: 1234&lt;div class=&quot;shadow-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;drop-shadow&quot; src=&quot;my-image.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;shadow&quot; src=&quot;my-image.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; The rest will be done by CSS: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324div.shadow-wrapper &#123; /* Wrapper */ position: relative; margin-bottom: 30px;&#125;div.shadow-wrapper img.drop-shadow &#123; /* Original image */ position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; z-index: 1; margin: 0; float: none;&#125;div.shadow-wrapper img.shadow &#123; /* Shadow image */ position: absolute; width: 90%; left: 5%; top: 15%; z-index: 0; filter: blur(10px); opacity: 0.8; margin: 0; float: none;&#125; To make long story short: The wrapper is positioned relative and both images absolute. The shadow image is 10% smaller than the original, blurred by 10 pixels and lies beneath the original one, slightly shifted down by 15%. Very important is to give the wrapper a bottom margin, otherwise the shadow will be rendered to tight to other elements, what looks not good. The ScriptWhat the script should do: Take any image tag with a particular class name (here drop-shadow) Create a new wrapper with all classes the image tag has Size the wrapper as the image Place the image tag inside the wrapper Clone the image tag and append it to the wrapper also Replace the image tag with the new wrapper HTML 1234567891011121314151617181920document.querySelectorAll(&quot;img.drop-shadow&quot;).forEach(function(item) &#123; let wrapper = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;); wrapper.classList.add(&quot;shadow-wrapper&quot;); item.classList.forEach(function(c) &#123; if (c != &quot;drop-shadow&quot;) wrapper.classList.add(c); &#125;); wrapper.style.width = item.clientWidth + &quot;px&quot;; wrapper.style.height = item.clientHeight + &quot;px&quot;; wrapper.insertAdjacentHTML(&quot;beforeend&quot;, item.outerHTML); let shadow = item.cloneNode(); shadow.classList.remove(&quot;drop-shadow&quot;); shadow.classList.add(&quot;shadow&quot;); wrapper.insertAdjacentHTML(&quot;beforeend&quot;, shadow.outerHTML); item.outerHTML = wrapper.outerHTML;&#125; The result in comparison with no shadow and the default box-shadow: Happy shadowing…","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/"}],"tags":[{"name":"CSS","slug":"CSS","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/CSS/"},{"name":"Imaging","slug":"Imaging","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Imaging/"},{"name":"DOM","slug":"DOM","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/DOM/"}]},{"title":"Generate Social Media Images Automatically","subtitle":null,"date":"2021-07-10","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Generate-Social-Media-Images-Automatically/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Generate-Social-Media-Images-Automatically/","excerpt":"From day one of this blog I wanted to combine two of my passions: tech stuff and photography.

But … it’s only the image, without a visual reference to the post itself. In this article I want to show you how to combine the photo with some meta information of the post automatically, to get a Social Media Image. Starting point of my thoughts were two posts from Drew McLellan (Dynamic Social Sharing Images) and Ryan Filler (Automatic Social Share Images), to which I have already referred in my post Discoveries #11. Drew and Ryan utilizes the Node.JS library Puppeteer, which runs a headless Chromium (or Chrome browser) over the DevTools protocol to process a web page … for example to take a screenshot: 12345678const puppeteer = require(&#x27;puppeteer&#x27;);(async () =&gt; &#123; const browser = await puppeteer.launch(); const page = await browser.newPage(); await page.goto(&#x27;https://example.com&#x27;); await page.screenshot(&#123; path: &#x27;example.png&#x27; &#125;); await browser.close();&#125;)(); The idea is, to create a temporary HTML page with the photo and all necessary text for the social media image, take a screenshot of it and save it as PNG. As I run my blog with Hexo, a Static Site Generator (SSG), all information about a post is defined in a Markdown (MD) file with some Frontmatter for the meta information. Therefore, the Social Media Image Generator script in my mind had to do following tasks: Iterate recursively over all MD files in Hexo _source/posts folder Read the MD’s Frontmatter (for information about photo, title, subtitle and more) Create a temporary HTML file with the aid of a template Run Puppeteer script over the temporary file to take a screenshot Store the PNG to a central folder Optimize the PNG Change the meta tags in the posts to reference the new image The FrontmatterI pimped the Frontmatter of the original Hexo configuration a bit, in order to provide an individual photo for each post: 123456789101112---title: Generate Social Media Images Automaticallysubtitle:date: 2021-07-10 11:07:31photograph: file: DSC_6776.jpg name: Color Brushes link: &#x27;https://500px.com/photo/79965349&#x27;categories: - JavaScript...--- Among other, there are the basic information, I wanted to have on my social media image: photograph.file (as the image itself) and title, subtitle and categories (for the text on the image). The ScriptThe complete script, in two versions (CommonJS and ES Module) is available at GitHub. tl;dr My script became a JavaScript class, separating the tasks in several methods and a constructor to get all necessary information as parameters. The class exports the main method generate() for calling the script: social-media-image-generator.cjs12345678910111213141516171819202122232425const _currentPath = __dirname;var _postFolder;var _photoFolder;var _templateFile;var _targetFolder;class Generator &#123; constructor(postFolder, photoFolder, templateFile, targetFolder) &#123; _postFolder = path.join(_currentPath, postFolder); _photoFolder = path.join(_currentPath, photoFolder); _templateFile = path.join(_currentPath, templateFile); _targetFolder = path.join(_currentPath, targetFolder); &#125; generate() &#123; ... &#125; getPostFiles(dirPath, allFiles) &#123; ... &#125; async processPost(fileName, vars) &#123; ... &#125; async createImage(fileName, tempFile) &#123; ... &#125;&#125;module.exports.Generator = Generator I chose parameters, in order not to bind the script too tightly to my favourite SSG Hexo: _postFolder - Where are the post files stored? _photoFolder - Where are the photos stored? _templateFile - Where is the template file for the temporary HTML stored? _targetFolder - Where should the generated PNG files be stored?

Handlebars is able to compile a template into a JavaScript variable, what makes it easy to reuse it. Good for performance and stability. As I wanted to utilize the template to generate temporary HTML files, I needed a temporary folder, which can be deleted afterwards. social-media-image-generator.cjs123456789101112131415161718192021222324const handlebars = require(&quot;handlebars&quot;);var _template;const _tempFolder = &quot;./~temp&quot;;class Generator &#123;

const generator = new Generator(postFolder, photoFolder, templateFile, targetFolder); generator.generate();&#125;); It is important not to store the social-media-image-generator.cjs in Hexo’s scripts folder like the event script above, because Hexo will try to execute it automatically. You have to create a different folder like lib to store and reference it from there. The ResultHere is the result from my approach in Hexo, as I run hexo generate for this blog post: The very last thing I had to do, was to change the source of the image meta tag mentioned at the top, to reference to newly created social media image.

Don’t reinvent the wheel, but reuse the work of other developers. But … we have to recognize the limits and prevent to fall into the dependency hell. To get a better overview over dependencies, regarding NPM and other repositories, some Google engineers have published a project called Open Source Insights a couple of days ago. If you look at a library on NPM, you immediately see the direct dependencies, but that could just be the tip of the iceberg. Insights shows you the big picture in form of an interactive graph or a complete list with many additional information of the complete dependency chain. As Google says: Your software and your users rely not only on the code you write, but also on the code your code depends on, the code that code depends on, and so on. An accurate view of the complete dependency graph is critical to understanding the state of your project. Next time, before you type npm install ... take a quick look at the Insights page of the library, because it won’t give you an overview over the dependecies only, but also some security advisories to let you decide if it is a good idea to use it. Very valueable for the authors of exisiting NPM projects also, because it shows the consequences of dependency decisions very clearly and gives hints to make the own library less sensitive to vulnerabilities. Let us hope, that Google removes the describing adjective experimental from the project some day and adds more and more functionality to it (like a working responsiveness ;) in order to establish Open Source Insights as a main source of information about reusable Open Source software.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Node.js","slug":"Node-js","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Node-js/"}]},{"title":"Discoveries #10","subtitle":null,"series":"Discoveries","date":"2021-05-24","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Discoveries-10/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Discoveries-10/","excerpt":"Todays Discoveries it’s all about my favourite programming language JavaScript.

It is able to convert old-fashioned Pingbacks to Webmentions, supports deleting of unwanted mentions, has a Blocklist for blocking domains, Webhooks for real-time processing and last but not least an API to get all your Webmentions per page or per site. Setupwebmention.io needs a registration and Aaron uses his own authentication method Web Sign-In over IndieLogin to achieve that. After you have signed in, you see your settings with two important links, you have to integrate in the head of your HTML: 12&lt;link rel=&quot;webmention&quot; href=&quot;https://webmention.io/[YOUR-BLOG-DOMAIN]/webmention&quot; /&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;pingback&quot; href=&quot;https://webmention.io/[YOUR-BLOG-DOMAIN]/xmlrpc&quot; /&gt; They define your page on the one hand as a webmention- and on the other hand as a pingback endpoint. Every send Webmention or Pingback from another blog is routed to these URL’s. You will also find your API Key on this page. To be honest, is not a real API key, but rather a key to retrieve all incoming webmentions at once. Therefore it does not need to be kept private and secured. There is no way to modify your incoming Webmentions over it. Incoming Webmentions I’m implementing my Hexo&#x2F;Webmention solution as I’m writing this post, therefore I don’t have any Webmentions to show as an example. Since all mentions on webmention.io are publicly accessible, I simply use Max Böcks article Using Webmentions in Eleventy in the following. Max, I hope it is ok … :) Aaron has defined three ways to get the incoming mentions of a particular article on your blog: 1. View as HTML page https://webmention.io/api/mentions.html?target=https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/ Using it this way, webmention.io integrates the content with some styles and other information of the sending post for easy reading. 2. Consume as Atom feed https://webmention.io/api/mentions.atom?target=https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/ 3. Get as JSON https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?target=https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/ Especially the last one is interesting for us, because we can use it to automate getting the data and integrate it in our blog post. You can also use all these Url’s to get the Webmentions of all of your pages, by changing the target parameter into: ...?token=[YOUR-API-KEY] The feed with token for getting all webmentions is particularly practical for checking whether there are new ones for your blog via a feed reader. There are some parameters you have to be aware of: Parameter Example Paging ?per-page=20&amp;page=0 (default, page 1 with 20 entries) Sorting By ?sort-by=created (default) Sorting Direction ?sort-dir=down (default, newest first) Time Limit ?since=2021-05-10T12:00:00-0700 ID Limit ?since_id=500). You can find more on parameters in the documentation of webmention.io’s source code here: https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io. The DataLet’s dive into the data. The JSON is a list and every Webmention is an entry underneath children, with following useful fields: Field Purpose author.name Name of the sender author.photo Avatar photo of the sender author.url Personal URL of the sender wm-id Unique ID of the Webmention wm-target URL of your post wm-received UTC Date&#x2F;Time sended wm-source URL of the sending post published Publish Date&#x2F;Time of the sending post wm-property Webmention type out of the following values:mention-of&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Mention as link in postin-reply-to&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Reply to your postlike-of&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Like of your postrepost-of&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Repost of your postbookmark-of&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Bookmark of your post Other occuring fields are optional, but no less interesting for displaying them at your post: Field Purpose name Name of the Webmention (title of the sending post or something) summary.type Summary type of the Webmention, e.g. “text&#x2F;plain” summary.value Summary text of the Webmention content.html Content as HTML of sending post content.text Content as text of sending post The fact that we get the complete HTML content of the sending post, means that we easily can parse it for IndieWeb microformats (see Part 1) to get even more information about it and the blog owner! IntegrationWe have two ways to choose from in order to integrate the data thus obtained into the post: Static … means while generating the site Dynamic … means real-time via client-side Javascript The static approach has two big disadvantages: The Webmentions are only visible with a time delay, due to the need of generating the pages of the site Hexos generation mechanism only takes those, whose content has beed updated in the meanwhile, but do not take into account any external data like Webmentions. We would have to fire up the time consuming clean and generate all the time So, let’s go for the dynamic approach, a little bit JavaScript, which loads the Webmentions on page load (like most Commenting platforms do). First of all, we need a placeholder in our article.ejs, where the Webmentions will be displayed. Somewhere near the comments and implemented as another partial: layout/_partial/article.ejs12345678910111213&lt;article id=&quot;&lt;%= post.layout %&gt;-&lt;%= post.slug %&gt;&quot; class=&quot;article article-type-&lt;%= post.layout %&gt; h-entry&quot; itemscope itemprop=&quot;blogPost&quot;&gt; ... &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/webmentions&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/comments&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/related&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/nav&#x27;) %&gt;&lt;/article&gt; layout/_partial/post/webmentions.ejs12345678910111213&lt;div class=&quot;article-webmentions&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;webmentions-placeholder&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;wm-placeholder&quot;&gt;No Webmentions yet...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;script&gt; window.addEventListener(&#x27;load&#x27;, function () &#123; insertWebmentions(&#x27;&lt;%- post.slug.toLowerCase() %&gt;&#x27;); &#125;) &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt; The call insertWebmentions references to the asset script webmentions.js, which will be bundled via Grunt in my case, but you can place it where you want and add it to your articles head element. The main thing is, that it will load when the article page is launched. The script checks, if the user has already loaded the Webmentions for the current page from webmention.io in the last hour and do so if not, and stores the data in the browser by the pages key (slug) and with a timestamp: assets/webmentions.js12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243function insertWebmentions(key) &#123; const lsTimestamp = &quot;wmts_&quot; + key; const lsWebmentions = &quot;wm_&quot; + key; const currentUrl = window.location.href; const wmUrl = `https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?target=$&#123;currentUrl&#125;&amp;per-page=1000&amp;sort-dir=up`; let lastRequest; let webmentions; // Get data from browser storage, if available if (localStorage.getItem(lsTimestamp) &amp;&amp; localStorage.getItem(lsWebmentions)) &#123; lastRequest = localStorage.getItem(lsTimestamp); webmentions = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(lsWebmentions)); &#125; if(webmentions &amp;&amp; lastRequest &amp;&amp; Math.abs(Date.now() - lastRequest) / (60*60*1000) &lt; 1) &#123; // Webmentions are present and not older than an hour process(); &#125; else &#123; // Get Webmentions from webmention.io load().then(() =&gt; &#123; process(); &#125;); &#125;; /** * Load webmention.io&#x27;s JSON data for the current page */ async function load() &#123; const response = await fetch(wmUrl); webmentions = await response.json(); localStorage.setItem(lsWebmentions, JSON.stringify(webmentions)); localStorage.setItem(lsTimestamp, Date.now()); &#125; /** * Process Webmentions */ function process() &#123; ... &#125;&#125; Actually the script loads the first 1000 Webmentions in ascending order of their retreiving date. Should last for a while or I may feel like adding real paging at some point ;) On processing the webmentions, a separate HTML block is generated for each type (wm-property) regarding the content of the Webmention, whereby the header is always the same. The VERB refers to the Webmentions type: mentioned, replied, liked, bookmarked or reposted.

Therefore, it is good to give the user a possibility to submit his blog post, where he mentions yours, directly. As webmentions.io supports posting a new source, the HTML form is quite simple an we can integrate it in the partial from above, below the script tag: layout/_partial/post/webmentions.ejs1234567891011121314151617181920&lt;div class=&quot;article-webmentions&quot;&gt; ... &lt;form class=&quot;webmention-form&quot; action=&quot;https://webmention.io/&lt;%- config.title %&gt;&gt;/webmention&quot; name=&quot;webmention-form&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;webmention-form-source&quot;&gt;Your Article URL:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;input class=&quot;webmention-form-source&quot; type=&quot;url&quot; name=&quot;source&quot; placeholder=&quot;https://your-blog.com/your-article&quot; required=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;target&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Send Webmention&quot;&gt; &lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt; The variable config.title defines the name of your blog with which you have registered at webmention.io. In the hidden input, we use the permalink of the current page&#x2F;article as the mentions target. Building BridgesYes, the IndieWeb and Webmentions are an alternative concept of social networking, bypassing the big silos like Facebook, Twitter and Co. … but they exist and they have a massive reach. Of course, your posts will be shared there, so why not include those mentions? Bridgy is such a bridge builder. It connects your blog with the big social media players: The only thing you have to do, is to allow Bridgy to access your social media data, like your Tweets on Twitter. If somebody mentions you and one of your articles as a Tweet, Reply or Like, it sends a mention to the endpoint defined in your HTML, in our case webmention.io. Thats it … kinda magic. SummarySome people say, Webmentions makes commenting forms on blogs, like Disqus or others, obsolete, but I don’t agree with that, because not every visitor owns a blog and not every blog owner want’s to write a post only to comment the thoughts of another blogger. Both approaches work well side by side and complement each other. Webmentions are super to build a blog network and increasing your blogs coverage. As I said in Part 1 … we write for readers.

Let software do the job… In this article I will only briefly go into the basics and then show an implementation solution for the SSG Hexo. Basic ConceptsNothing describes the flow of Webmentions better than this: Frankie posts a blog entry. Alex has thoughts in response, so also posts a blog entry linking to Frankie’s. Alex’s publishing software finds the link and fetches Frankie’s post, finding the URL of Frankie’s Webmention endpoint in the document. Alex’s software sends a notification to the endpoint. Frankie’s software then fetches Alex’s post to verify that it really does link back, and then chooses how to display the reaction alongside Frankie’s post. --- Drew McLellan Basically Webmentions allow notifications between web addresses, therefore every post, which is part of the interaction, has to have a unique permalink. A blog software that wants to support webmentions must cover 4 main points: The HTML has to tell others who you are The HTML has to give dedicated informations about your posts Sending a message to another blog, in case you mentioned one of its posts Reveiving messages from other blogs, in case they mentioned one of your posts Point 4 is probably the most interesting for all of us, because it pats our own ego on the back, since we usually don’t write for ourselves, but for others, and reactions to it, show us that it wasn’t pointless. Step 1: The Personal &amp; Profile HTMLAs you want to interact with other blogs participating in the IndieWeb with your posts, they have to know something about you and your articles in a machine-readable form. Personal InformationHTML is machine-readable per se, but you have to tell others what to look for by adding defined classes to the tags which holds the information, in order to enable them to get specific information about you, like your name, your mail-address or links to other profiles f.e. Github, Twitter and so on. It is necessary to have this information not only in an ABOUT page, but also on each post page. You can achieve this either by having an ABOUT block like here on kiko.io or providing the information in hidden HTML tags elsewhere in your HTML. It does not matter which tags you use, you only have to add the defined class to the tag of a particular information in your Hexo EJS file. The information will be extracted out of the tag’s inner text. The most used classes for personal blogs as follows: Class Information h-card Wrapper for all personal information. All other classes below has to be used on child tags p-name Full name u-email Email address u-photo Photo p-role Role u-url URL representing the person p-locality City or Town p-region State or province p-country-name Country name Please keep in mind not to give too much information about you to the public. It could get unpleasant… Profile InformationFor providing links to other profiles, anchor (A) tags with the special attribute rel=&quot;me&quot; will be used, which indicates profile equivalence and can be used for identity-consolidation. With this extension of your blog HTML, you are able to sign in using your domain at sites which supports Web Sign-In over the concept of RelMeAuth, for example those who use IndieAuth.net - OAuth for the open web. You only have to make sure, that the endpoints of your profile links have backlinks to your blog with a rel=&quot;me“. Unfortunately, not many services offer the definition of such a backlink. Github, for example, is an exception. You can give it a try at IndieAuth.com. Example Step 2: The Article HTMLTagging articles with meta information for the IndieWeb is similarly simple, by adding following classes in your article.ejs file: Class Information h-entry Wrapper for all article related information p-name Title p-summary Short summary e-content Content dt-published Publish date dt-updated Update date u-url Permalink In case you work with the default Hexo theme ‘landscape’, I advise you to split your article.ejs in two files, because it is used for the article itself and for the excerpts on the start page and archive pages also. I have made an excerpt.ejs with all the information needed for listing the posts and cut back my article.ejs to the bare minimum, but with the IndieWeb related classes above (or in the linked partials if necessary), because only the article page itself should have these informations, respectively an h-entry class, to indicate that there are IndieWeb data! layout/_partial/article.ejs123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536&lt;article id=&quot;&lt;%= post.layout %&gt;-&lt;%= post.slug %&gt;&quot; class=&quot;article article-type-&lt;%= post.layout %&gt; h-entry&quot; itemscope itemprop=&quot;blogPost&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;article-meta&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;h-card p-author&quot; style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;u-photo&quot; src=&quot;&lt;%- config.photo %&gt;&quot; alt=&quot;&lt;%- config.author %&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;p-name u-url&quot; href=&quot;&lt;%- config.url %&gt;&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;%- config.author %&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/date&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-date dt-published&#x27;, date_format: &#x27;DD MMM YYYY&#x27; &#125;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/category&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-category p-category&#x27; &#125;) %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;article-inner&quot;&gt; &lt;header class=&quot;article-header&quot;&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/title&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-title p-name&#x27;, show_link: false &#125;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/subtitle&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-subtitle p-summary&#x27; &#125;) %&gt; &lt;/header&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;article-entry e-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;%- post.content %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;footer class=&quot;article-footer&quot;&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/tag&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-tags&#x27; &#125;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/permalink&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-permalink u-url&#x27; &#125;) %&gt; &lt;/footer&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/comments&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/related&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/nav&#x27;) %&gt;&lt;/article&gt; External LinksThe Interaction with other blogs takes place through linking to those external sources in the content of your article. Lets say you want to write about a specific topic and to mention the work of another developer, then you just place a link to his post in your Markdown, as you have been doing all along: /source/_posts/my-fancy-post.md1234# My Fancy Post...Jack has done a wonderful job with his [Awesome Work](https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work)... It will be transformed while generating into something like that: /output/.../my-fancy-post/index.html123456789101112131415161718192021&lt;body&gt; ... &lt;article class=&quot;h-entry&quot;&gt; ... &lt;div class=&quot;article-inner&quot;&gt; &lt;header class=&quot;article-header&quot;&gt; &lt;h1 class=&quot;p-name&quot;&gt;My Fancy Post&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/header&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;article-entry e-content&quot;&gt; ... &lt;p&gt; Jack has done a wonderful job with his &lt;a href=&quot;https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work&quot;&gt;Awesome Work&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; ... &lt;/article&gt; ...&lt;/body&gt; In the terms of the IndieWeb concept, your post will a be an article, which mentions other posts, as the old-fashioned pingbacks do. Special Post FormatsA true interaction takes place, when you are posting in a certain syndication context … with a note as a response to the work of others, mainly by adding additional classes to the external link: u-in-reply-to … to indicate that your post is a reply to a post as part of a conversation u-like-of … to indicate that your post is a like u-repost-of … to indicate that your post is a repost (100% re-publication) u-bookmark-of … to indicate that your post is a bookmark Every response type can have additional information about your post and the syndication of it. Example REPLY12345678910111213&lt;body&gt; ... &lt;div class=&quot;h-entry&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt; In reply to: &lt;a class=&quot;u-in-reply-to&quot; href=&quot;https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work&quot;&gt;Jacks Blog: Awesome Work&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p-name e-content&quot;&gt; Jack, you have done a wonderful job! &lt;/p&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; ...&lt;/body&gt; Example LIKE12345678910&lt;body&gt; ... &lt;div class=&quot;h-entry&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p-summary&quot;&gt; Kristof liked &lt;a class=&quot;u-like-of&quot; href=&quot;https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work&quot;&gt;Jacks Awesome Work at https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; ...&lt;/body&gt; Currently, I would not recommend writing responses as a normal post in Hexo, as it is based on structured text, that best describes the IndieWeb concept of an ARTICLE.As this post is part of a new series called IndieWeb, I will post a solution for responses is the near future.

Don’t miss Part 2: Hexo and the IndieWeb (Sending Webmentions) … TerminologyThere are a lot of posts out there which explains the basic concepts of the IndieWeb and Webmentions in particular and you will stumble upon some terms, which has to be explained: Personal Domain … is a domain name that you personally own, control, and use to represent yourself on the internet. Getting a personal domain is the first step towards getting on the indieweb, and is therefore a requirement for IndieMark Level 1 --- indieweb.org (Personal Domain) Microformats … are small patterns of HTML to represent commonly published things like people, events, blog posts, reviews and tags in web pages. They are the quickest &amp; simplest way to provide an API to the information on your website. --- microformats.org (Wiki) POSSE … is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere, the practice of posting content on your own site first, then publishing copies or sharing links to third parties (like social media silos) with original post links to provide viewers a path to directly interacting with your content. --- indieweb.org (POSSE) Backfeed … is the process of syndicating interactions on your POSSE copies back (AKA reverse syndicating) to your original posts. --- indieweb.org (Backfeed) Web sign-in … is signing in to websites using your personal web address (without having to use your e-mail address). Web sign-in supersedes OpenID. --- indieweb.org (Web sign-in) RelMeAuth … is a proposed open standard for using rel&#x3D;”me” links to profiles on oauth supporting services to authenticate via either those profiles or your own site. RelMeAuth is the technology behind Web sign-in. --- microformats.org (RelMeAuth) IndieAuth … is a federated login protocol for Web sign-in, enabling users to use their own domain to sign in to other sites and services. --- indieweb.org (IndieAuth) More Info A List Apart: Webmentions: Enabling Better Communication on the Internetindieweb.org: Getting Startedindieweb.org: How to set up web sign-in on your own domainindieweb.org: IndieWeb ExamplesBryce Wray: Webmentions in three SSGs: Part 1Keith J.

Ok then … make a successor on your own, fella… Basic FunctionalityLet me describe how the original plugin and my successor are working in general: Assume, you have several posts from different authors and you want a list of all posts for every author. The only thing you have to do (after installation and configuration of the plugin), is to add a custom variable called author to the FrontMatter of each post, with the name of the author as value. /source/_posts/my-fancy-post.md1234title: My Fancy Postdate: 2021-04-25 13:41:46author: Kristof... Next time you run hexo generate, several new files will be available in your output folder: One INDEX page … for the author index, with a list of all available authors and the number of the posts: &#x2F;authors&#x2F;index.html Many POSTS pages …, one for each author for the author index, with all of the authors posts: &#x2F;authors&#x2F;kristof&#x2F;index.html &#x2F;authors&#x2F; … &#x2F;index.html New Plugin NameIn order to avoid confusion (and be able to provide the plugin on Github&#x2F;NPM) I needed a new name for the plugin and due to the fact that it is a generator, I named it simply hexo-generator-anything. New FeaturesThe original code was really hard to read, because every second variable was named ‘index’, therefore I started with some refactorings, before I continued implementing new features. ConfigurationThe original, one-dimensional variable to index mapping, wasn’t meaningful enough for me. The new mapping is now a dictionary and has unique identifiers: /_config.yml123456anything: layout_index: anything-index layout_posts: anything-posts index_mappings: - variable: author path: authors The template* setting names has changed into layout_*, to make more clear what they are meant for. They are pointing to an existing EJS file in your Hexo themes layout folder to render the particular page. layout_indexEJS file (without extension) to render the INDEX page layout_PostsEJS file (without extension) to render each POSTS page On Github and in the NPM package you will find sample EJS files and some partials, to take the SoC pattern into account. The original titleSeparator setting is not longer available, because it is not necessary anymore. By providing a data structure for index with the attributes name and caption, a title can be put together in the EJS file itself. Introducing linked Markdown filesOne of my needs was, to provide more information on the INDEX page and the POSTS pages for each entry or, to stay with the example, for each author. As the _posts folder is used for storing the post data files, I introduced a _anything folder for dropping MD files, which are linked to the index and its values. The subfolders of _anything are representing the index and the files in it each possible value of the index. The file is structured like any other post file: the FrontMatter data at the top and below some content to show along with the the entry to describe it: /source/_anything/authors/kristof.md1234567---title: Kristofgithub: https://github.com/kristofzerbeavatar: kristof.png---... some smart things to say about Kristof, or links or images, whatever ... The INDEX file itself may have its own Markdown file, to provide addition text or data to it, like describing the list. The variable title is a requirement in the Markdown files, but you can add as many variables as you need and use it in the EJS files. All data will be passed through to the template. ConclusionThe new plugin runs very well and it is heavy in use on generating the sections Series and Projects of this blog.

The most useful place for this is in the appsettings.json of the Core 5.0 Web API project: appsettings.json123456789101112131415...&quot;Callers&quot;: [ &#123; &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;ApiKey&quot;: null, &quot;IPAddress&quot;: &quot;::1&quot; &#125;, &#123; &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;, &quot;ApiKey&quot;: &quot;mytopsecretapikeyforjohndoe&quot;, &quot;IPAddress&quot;: &quot;*&quot; &#125; ]... This list has two entries: one for the server itself (“localhost”), which is restricted to the local IP address &quot;::1&quot;, and one for the test user &quot;John Doe&quot;, who can access from any IP address (&quot;*&quot;), but must supply his personal API key with his requests. In order to handle this setting, we have to introduce it to the system at startup as a class: CallerSetting.cs123456public class CallerSetting&#123; public string Name &#123; get; set; &#125; public string ApiKey &#123; get; set; &#125; public string IPAddress &#123; get; set; &#125;&#125; Startup.cs1234567891011...public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) &#123; ... IConfigurationSection configSection = Configuration.GetSection(&quot;Callers&quot;); services.Configure&lt;List&lt;CallerSetting&gt;&gt;(configSection);&#125;... The ControllerLet’s assume we have a controller, which handles the API requests, like this: MyFancyController.cs123456789101112131415using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;namespace MyAPIProject&#123; [Route(&quot;api/helloworld&quot;)] [ApiController] public class MyFancyAPIController : ControllerBase &#123; [HttpGet] public string Get() &#123; return &quot;Hello World&quot;; &#125; &#125;&#125; To prevent to write a request check against our new settings in each action method, we can decorate the whole controller class by introducing an new custom Attribute, which will do the work: MyFancyController.cs1234567...[Route(&quot;api/helloworld&quot;)][ApiController][AuthenticateApiRequest]public class MyFancyAPIController : ControllerBase... The AttributeHere is the code for the new attribute. It uses the IActionFilter. These filters run within the ASP.NET Core action invocation pipeline, in our case BEFORE the action is entered (OnActionExecutionAsync). AuthenticateApiRequestAttribute.cs1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters;using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;using System;using System.Collections.Generic;using System.Threading.Tasks;using System.Linq;namespace MyAPIProject&#123; [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)] public class AuthenticateApiRequestAttribute : Attribute, IAsyncActionFilter &#123; public async Task OnActionExecutionAsync ( ActionExecutingContext context, ActionExecutionDelegate next ) &#123; // Get an Api Key from Request Header context.HttpContext.Request.Headers.TryGetValue( &quot;ApiKey&quot;, out var requestApiKey ); // Get the remote IP Address var requestIpAddress = context.HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress.ToString(); // Get access to &#x27;appsettings.json&#x27; var appSettings = context.HttpContext.RequestServices.GetRequiredService&lt;IConfiguration&gt;(); // Get &#x27;Callers&#x27; list from settings var callers = appSettings.GetSection(&quot;Callers&quot;) .Get&lt;List&lt;CallerSetting&gt;&gt;(); // Get all Callers with matching IP Adress and/or API Key via LINQ var current = callers.Where(c =&gt; (c.IPAddress == requestIpAddress) || (c.IPAddress == &quot;*&quot; &amp;&amp; c.ApiKey == requestApiKey) || (c.IPAddress == requestIpAddress &amp;&amp; c.ApiKey == requestApiKey)); // Do we have a match? if (current.Count() == 0) &#123; // No, then return with an error context.Result = new ContentResult() &#123; StatusCode = 401, Content = &quot;Unauthorized Access&quot; &#125;; return; &#125; await next(); &#125; &#125;&#125; The Result More Info Microsoft Docs: Filters in ASP.NET CoreMicrosoft Docs: Configuration in ASP.NET Core","categories":[{"name":".NET","slug":"NET","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/NET/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Visual Studio","slug":"Visual-Studio","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Visual-Studio/"},{"name":"WebAPI","slug":"WebAPI","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/WebAPI/"},{"name":"Authentication","slug":"Authentication","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Authentication/"}]},{"title":"Discoveries #7","subtitle":null,"series":"Discoveries","date":"2021-02-25","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Discoveries-7/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Discoveries-7/","excerpt":"February and the first sunny days in 2021.

In this article I want to show you my approach on this… My solution is based on a template system that I implemented into my project at an earlier stage. If you are interested in how this works, I recommend you read my article Utilize a repository of reusable ES6 template literals. Let’s start with the standard scaffold of an HTML5 app, extended with some style‘s, an initialization script and a lonely main element, we want to fill with some localized content: index.html1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;language&quot; content=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;Native JavaScript Multilanguage Templating&lt;/title&gt; &lt;style&gt; body &#123; padding: 2rem; &#125; main &#123; text-align: center; &#125; &lt;/style&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt; import &#123; App &#125; from &#x27;./app.js&#x27;; window.app = new App(); app.init(); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;main&gt;&lt;/main&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; The script points to the following ES6 module class in the file app.js: app.js1234567891011class App &#123; constructor() &#123; // do something when the class is instantiated &#125; init() &#123; // do something to initialize the app &#125;&#125;export &#123; App &#125;; Nothing uncommon so far, if you are familiar with ES6 classes and imports&#x2F;exports. Now let’s create a localizations.js file, to store the needed localized strings in all wanted languages. Every language will have its own branch in a Localizations object, represented by its two-letter ISO-639-1 language code. All translations are accessible via an unique english key word: localizations.js12345678910111213141516171819202122export function Localizations() &#123; return &#123; &quot;EN&quot;: &#123; &quot;helloWorld&quot;: &quot;Hello World&quot; &#125;, &quot;DE&quot;: &#123; &quot;helloWorld&quot;: &quot;Hallo Welt&quot; &#125;, &quot;ES&quot;: &#123; &quot;helloWorld&quot;: &quot;Hola, mundo&quot; &#125;, &quot;FR&quot;: &#123; &quot;helloWorld&quot;: &quot;Bonjour le monde&quot; &#125;, &quot;RU&quot;: &#123; &quot;helloWorld&quot;: &quot;Здравствуйте, мир&quot; &#125;, &quot;JP&quot;: &#123; &quot;helloWorld&quot;: &quot;ハローワールド&quot; &#125; &#125;&#125; As we import the localizations.js in our app.js, we can initialize the localizations in the constructor of the app class with the language code of the users browser: app.js12345678910111213141516import &#123; Localizations &#125; from &#x27;./localizations.js&#x27;;class App &#123; constructor() &#123; // Get browser language this.langCode = window.navigator.language.split(&quot;-&quot;)[0].toUpperCase(); // Init localization to access via &#x27;app.localization&#x27; globally this.localization = Localizations()[this.langCode]; &#125; ... app.localization now holds the key&#x2F;value list of the current language. Now we implement the templating class, as described in Utilize a repository of reusable ES6 template literals and define a first template called helloWorld … templates.js123456789101112131415class Templates &#123; helloWorld(data) &#123; return this.fillTemplate(` &lt;h1&gt;$&#123;app.localization.helloWorld&#125;&lt;/h1&gt; `, data); &#125; fillTemplate(templateString, templateVars)&#123; var func = new Function(...Object.keys(templateVars), &quot;return `&quot; + templateString + &quot;`;&quot;); return func(...Object.values(templateVars)); &#125;&#125;export &#123; Templates &#125;; The inner text of the h1 element in the helloWorld template refers to the globally available variable app.localization, we initialized in the last step, and points to the translation helloWorld. In app.js we import the templates.js and implement some code in the init method, to get the template and bring it to the DOM: app.js1234567891011121314151617import &#123; Localizations &#125; from &#x27;./localizations.js&#x27;;import &#123; Templates &#125; from &#x27;./templates.js&#x27;;class App &#123; ... init() &#123; // Get &quot;Hello World&quot; H1 element in current language let helloWorld = app.templates.helloWorld(&#123;&#125;); //Insert H1 element into MAIN element document.querySelector(&quot;main&quot;) .insertAdjacentHTML(&quot;beforeend&quot;, helloWorld); &#125; This is it … In the following Github repository you will find a solution based on this example, extented with a language selector, cookie support and some helper methods to keep the code nice and clean: https://github.com/kristofzerbe/Native-JavaScript-Multilanguage-Templating","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Localization","slug":"Localization","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Localization/"},{"name":"ES6","slug":"ES6","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/ES6/"},{"name":"Templating","slug":"Templating","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Templating/"}]},{"title":"Remote Testing and Debugging with Chrome","subtitle":"How to test a local site on a mobile device and debug it locally","date":"2021-01-24","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Remote-Testing-and-Debugging-with-Chrome/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Remote-Testing-and-Debugging-with-Chrome/","excerpt":"Developing a website or web app means, you have installed an editor locally on your computer, writing your code locally and start a tiny, built-in web server for debugging locally in your preferred browser.

Should be the same technique as that of a reflection. Here is the HTML&#x2F;CSS code for it, as the people asking for it in the comments. What we want to achieve is this: Basically, we use a duplicate of the image and position it below the actual image, but slightly offset and blurred. It won’t be a performance issue, as some might think, because it is the very same file and will be loaded only once by the browser. For showing two images in the nearly same place in different layers, we need a wrapper… 1234&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;my-image.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;shadow&quot; src=&quot;my-image.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; … and some CSS for positioning the images on top of each other first. Here are the defaults for both image elements: 123456789101112div.image-wrapper &#123; position: relative;&#125;div.image-wrapper img &#123; position: absolute; display: block; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; z-index: 1;&#125; Now we have to style the duplicate image that it looks similar to the shadow. We washing it out using the blur filter and the opacity. 1234div.image-wrapper img.shadow &#123; filter: blur(10px); opacity: 0.8;&#125; Last step is to change the duplicates dimensions and the positioning below the original image. We squeeze it by 10% and shift it from left with half of the value back to the center, shift it from top to make it standout at the bottom and send it to the back by taking a lower z-index than the original image. 123456789div.image-wrapper img.shadow &#123; filter: blur(10px); opacity: 0.8; width: 90%; left: 5%; top: 40px; z-index: 0;&#125; Thats it.

The solution is to find and remove all appropriate classes at once, for example by using RegEx and a reusable helper function: 12345678910function removeClassByPrefix(el, prefix) &#123; let pattern = &#x27;(&#x27; + prefix + &#x27;(\\\\s|(-)?(\\\\w*)(\\\\s)?)).*?&#x27;; var regEx = new RegExp(pattern, &#x27;g&#x27;); el.className = el.className.replace(regEx, &#x27;&#x27;);&#125;//...let sidebar = document.getElementById(&quot;sidebar&quot;);removeClassByPrefix(sidebar, &quot;open&quot;); Update, 24 Jan 2021The first posted RegEx pattern didn’t worked properly, because it has found the prefix only and not the whole word, so I have updated the pattern.

Therefore the name template literals is a bit misleading. But … there is a way to achieve this anyway… Tagged TemplatesBeside Template Literals, ES6 introduced Tagged Templates (exact: Tagged Template Literals). These tags are functions, which allows you to parse a Template Literal. Definition is like this: 123function myTag(literals, ...expressions) &#123; //do the substitution and return a string&#125; You can use these tags by prefixing you literal: 1myTag`Hello $&#123;firstName&#125; $&#123;lastName&#125;!` Using Tagged Templates to build a template repository would mean, you have to write one tag function for every template … doable, but time consuming. Dynamic Tag FunctionTo avoid this, we can write a universal tag function, which utilizes the Function constructor, to create the tag function dynamically: 12345678function fillTemplate(templateString, templateVars) &#123; var func = new Function( ...Object.keys(templateVars), &quot;return `&quot; + templateString + &quot;`;&quot;) return func(...Object.values(templateVars));&#125; Don’t use this approach on user inputs as expressions, to avoid XSS!

Here I want to share the presets with you… Israeli ColorsThe mediaval walls of Jaffa glow in an inimitable way and brings other colors to shine the same way. var themeColor = \"#ffffff\"; if (localStorage.getItem(\"theme\") === 'dark') { themeColor = \"#222222\" } new ImageCompare(document.getElementById(\"image-compare-rmtmef\"), { controlColor: themeColor, controlShadow: false, verticalMode: false, showLabels: true, labelOptions: { before: 'Original', after: 'Preset', onHover: true, } }).mount(); Download Lightroom Preset Israeli Colors.xmp Israeli LightsThe light in the eastern Mediterranean is stunning.

My workflow for quite some time is to publish my photos on the hard drive, in a folder, which is synced via Dropbox with the cloud. From there I distribute them further. Important on this approach is, to have a coherent output folder structure in order find a particular image afterwards. I store my RAW images on an external hard drive in a structure like this: 1234&lt;Drive:\\&gt; -&gt; Fotos -&gt; &lt;Year&gt; -&gt; &lt;Year&gt;-&lt;Month&gt; &lt;Eventname&gt; First step after shooting is to copy all RAW files from the SD Card into a new subfolder of the current year. From there I import them into my Lightroom catalog. After sorting, rejecting, editing and flagging in Lightroom, I have to “export” the 4- and 5-star rated images into the cloud. There I have a slightly different structure, with a different root folder name and without the year: 123&lt;Dropbox&gt; -&gt; Photos -&gt; &lt;Year&gt;-&lt;Month&gt; &lt;Eventname&gt; With the built-in “Hard Drive” publish service of Lightroom, it is feasible to “export” the images, but not in my wanted folder structure, because it is not possible to use the sources’ folder name as output folder name by option. It has to be specified manually each time, which is not very comfortable. Plugin to the rescueJeffrey Friedl, who is in the Lightroom plugin business about a decade, offers two plugins, which can solve the problem easily: Jeffrey’s “Folder Publisher“ Lightroom Plugin Exports to disk in a folder hierarchy that mimics the folder hierarchy in your Lightroom catalog This one helps me not much, because my output folder would look like this: 12345&lt;Dropbox&gt; -&gt; Photos -&gt; Fotos -&gt; &lt;Year&gt; -&gt; &lt;Year&gt;-&lt;Month&gt; &lt;Eventname&gt; Jeffrey’s “Collection Publisher” Lightroom PluginExports to local disk in a folder hierarchy that mimics the collection hierarchy you build within Lightroom Besides the commonality of defining a root folder, where the files are exported to, Jeffrey’s plugin has much more options to improve the export. As the main feature, you can create collections within the plugin to define the export targets: In the options of these collections, you can set several templates (variables) to let the plugin name the export subfolder automatically: By using Smart Collections you don’t even need to drag &amp; drop your images to publish to the publish collection. Lightroom will do this auto-magically.","categories":[{"name":"Photo-Editing","slug":"Photo-Editing","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Photo-Editing/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Lightroom","slug":"Lightroom","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Lightroom/"},{"name":"Publishing","slug":"Publishing","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Publishing/"},{"name":"Plugin","slug":"Plugin","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Plugin/"}]},{"title":"Discoveries #4","subtitle":null,"series":"Discoveries","date":"2020-10-10","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Discoveries-4/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Discoveries-4/","excerpt":"It is so amazing how many cool stuff developers around the world are producing these days.

In the default Hexo theme Landscape, on which this blog is based, there is no such function built in, but as the Hexo community is very busy, there are some plugins you can use. Plugin: hexo-list-related-postsThis plugin, available at GitHub is pretty lean and generates a list of links to related posts based on tags. It just counts how often a tag is occuring and shows a list of related posts either by count descending or randomly. Advantage: Easy and fast Disadvantage: Necessity of a sophisticated tag system Technical approach Plugin: hexo-related-postsSergey Zwezdin made much more effort in his solution. The plugins depends on statistic methodologies like Stemming and TF&#x2F;IDF, provided by the Node library Natural. It has plenty setting options like weighting and reserved words in order to optimize results. Advantages: Much better results Disadvantages: Huge installation, because of many dependent Node modules Necessity of maintaining reserved words Technical approach Manually CuratedOne point, that no technical solution can achieve is: you can guide the reader through your blog, by pointing out posts, which doesn’t really belong to the topic, but tries to give him a wider perspective on your thoughts or work. This is only possible, if you link the related posts manually. Here is a way to implement the requirements… The right place to store related posts is in the Frontmatter of your article. Create a list below the keyword related and take the slug (name of the post file) of the posts you want to show below the article as entries: 12345title: My New fancy Postrelated: - my-other-post - one-of-my-first-posts - yet-another-post In your article.ejs add a new partial called related to the place where it should be shown under the content of the actual article: 123456789101112131415161718192021&lt;article id=&quot;&lt;%= post.layout %&gt;-&lt;%= post.slug %&gt;&quot; class=&quot;article article-type-&lt;%= post.layout %&gt;&quot; itemscope itemprop=&quot;blogPost&quot;&gt; ... &lt;div class=&quot;article-inner&quot;&gt; &lt;%- post.content %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;% if (!index)&#123; %&gt; &lt;!-- NEW RELATED PARTIAL --&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/related&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/comments&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/nav&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;% &#125; %&gt;&lt;/article&gt; In the folder themes/landscape/layout/_partial/post, where all partials are stored which belongs to posts, create the new partial file: related.ejs12345678910111213141516171819202122232425&lt;% if (post.related &amp;&amp; post.related.length)&#123; %&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;article-related&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Related&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;archives&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- Loop through the Frontmatter list of RELATED posts --&gt; &lt;% post.related.forEach(function(item) &#123; %&gt; &lt;!--Determine the post(s) with the given slug --&gt; &lt;% var posts = site.posts.filter(function(post) &#123; return post.slug.toLowerCase() === item.toLowerCase(); &#125;); %&gt; &lt;!-- Loop through the post(s) and render the archive panel --&gt; &lt;% posts.each(function(post) &#123; %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;../archive-post&#x27;, &#123; post: post, show_link: true &#125;) %&gt; &lt;% &#125;); %&gt; &lt;% &#125;); %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;% &#125; %&gt; (Remove the comments, because they doesn’t belong to EJS) In this partial we loop through the Frontmatter list of related posts, determine the post by the given slug and render an archive panel for each post.

We always use it, when showing an icon by using a symbol font like FontAwesome: 1234my-fancy-icon::before &#123; font-family: FontAwesome5Solid; content: &quot;\\f186&quot;;&#125; Mixed with a @media rule, we can “inject” the needed device value into the DOM, for example into the BODY tag, but you can take whatever you want: 12345@media (min-width: 1025px) &#123; body:before &#123; content: &quot;DESKTOP&quot;; &#125;&#125; Just one line more in the masses of CSS code to make a Web App responsive, but with this one you can do without many lines of JS. Now you can read out this value via JavaScript by getting the styles of the tag and get the injected content: 12var style = window.getComputedStyle(document.querySelector(&quot;body&quot;), &quot;:before&quot;);var breakpoint = style.getPropertyValue(&quot;content&quot;).replace(/\\&quot;/g, &quot;&quot;); It is advisable to embed this request into an event listener of DOMContentLoaded, because the rule has to be set, before you can access it.

Not optimal and should be solved by an own Hexo page, because GitHub Pages allows you to deliver a custom 404 page by creating simply a 404.html in the root of the website. As you can create separate pages in Hexo, this is done quickly by: 1hexo new page &quot;404&quot; It generates a new folder named 404 in your source folder, where a index.md is placed. In this file you can enter the text as Markdown you want to show to the user, in case of a 404 error (page not found) occurs. On generating the static files by hexo generate, a subfolder 404 with a index.html will be created, which doesn’t really work with GitHub Pages, because it needs a 404.htm in the root.

Not the One-Click experience I prefer. My goal was to show the permalink and, even more important, provide a simple way to copy and to share. JavaScript to the rescue… DisplayAs I run my blog with Hexo, I deal with EJS files. To show the permalink in my article.ejs, was quite simple. First step was to create a new partial file named permalink.ejs, to be called every time when the complete article has to be rendered: 123&lt;% if (!index)&#123; %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/permalink&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-permalink&#x27; &#125;) %&gt;&lt;% &#125; %&gt; The partial file looked like this in this step: 123&lt;div class=&quot;&lt;%= class_name %&gt;&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;a id=&quot;article-permalink&quot; href=&quot;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; CopyAs I read a little bit about the possibilities to copy text into the clipboard via JavaScript on MDN, it became obvious that a link is not the best solution, because using the exeCommand needs to have something selected and this is difficult on anchors. Then … do it with an input: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627&lt;div class=&quot;&lt;%= class_name %&gt;&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;article-permalink&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;a id=&quot;action-copy&quot; class=&quot;article-action&quot; href=&quot;javascript:copyPermalink();&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt; var copyText = document.querySelector(&quot;#article-permalink&quot;); //Disable Input by default copyText.disabled = true; function copyPermalink() &#123; //Enable Input copyText.disabled = false; //Select permalink text copyText.select(); //Copy to clipboard document.execCommand(&quot;copy&quot;); //Remove selection again copyText.blur(); //Disable Input again copyText.disabled = true; &#125;&lt;/script&gt; Nice, but a user feedback, that the text has been copied to the clipboard, was advisable, because nothing is more annoying, when you click somewhere and nothing seems to happen. As I hate default browser confirmations and other distracting messaging methods, I wanted to use the input itself, by fading out the link text, replace it with a message and fade in the text again: I extended my animation.styl (Hexo works with Stylus) with two keyframe animations … one for fading in, one for fading out… 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425@keyframes fadeIn &#123; 0% &#123; opacity:0; &#125; 100% &#123; opacity:1; &#125;&#125;.fade-in-500 animation: fadeIn ease 0.5s;.fade-in-1000 animation: fadeIn ease 1s;@keyframes fadeOut &#123; 0% &#123; opacity:1; &#125; 100% &#123; opacity:0; &#125;&#125;.fade-out-500 animation: fadeOut ease 0.5s;.fade-out-1000 animation: fadeOut ease 1s; … and wrote a setTimeout cascade to achive the effect: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152&lt;div class=&quot;&lt;%= class_name %&gt;&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;article-permalink&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;article-action action-copy&quot; href=&quot;javascript:copyPermalink();&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt; var copyText = document.querySelector(&quot;#article-permalink&quot;); copyText.disabled = true; function copyPermalink() &#123; copyText.disabled = false; copyText.select(); document.execCommand(&quot;copy&quot;); copyText.blur(); copyText.disabled = true; //Store original text var permalink = copyText.value; //Start fading out copyText.classList.add(&quot;fade-out-500&quot;); //Wait until animation is done setTimeout(function()&#123; //Set message, remove fadout class and add start fading in copyText.value = &quot;copied to clipboard&quot;; copyText.classList.remove(&quot;fade-out-500&quot;); copyText.classList.add(&quot;fade-in-1000&quot;); //Wait 2 seconds to show the message setTimeout(function() &#123; //Start to fade out message copyText.classList.add(&quot;fade-out-500&quot;); //Wait until animation is done setTimeout(function() &#123; //Set original text again and remove fadout class copyText.value = permalink; copyText.classList.remove(&quot;fade-out-500&quot;); //Wait until animation is done setTimeout(function() &#123; //Remove fadeout class copyText.classList.remove(&quot;fade-in-1000&quot;); &#125;, 500); &#125;, 500); &#125;, 2000); &#125;, 500); &#125;&lt;/script&gt; ShareThe second permalink feature was a little bit trickier, because I didn’t want to use one of the sharing libraries out there, whose business model is based on my readers data (always keep conservative on implementing third party stuff, because you never know what they are doing with the data). But a couple of months ago I read about a new native browser API for WebApps on the rise: Web Share API. Since 2019 W3C is working on this API, for sharing text, links and other content to an arbitrary destination of the user’s choice. On 27 August 2020 the published a Working Draft and on 16 September 2020 the latest Editors Draft. Brand new stuff. The browser support is not the best yet, but it will be getting better in the near feature, especially as Edge Chrome is one of the early adopters. web.dev lists important requirements on using this new feature in JavaScript: It can only be used on a site that supports HTTPS It must be invoked in response to a user action such as a click But it can share URL’s, text and even files! A raw implementation can be: 12345678910if (navigator.share === undefined) &#123; navigator.share(&#123; title: &#x27;My Post&#x27;, url: &#x27;https://my-domain.com/my-url&#x27;, &#125;) .then(() =&gt; console.log(&#x27;Successful share&#x27;)) .catch((error) =&gt; console.log(&#x27;Error sharing&#x27;, error));&#125; else &#123; // fallback&#125; I refrain to implement a fallback, rather I would like to show the appropriate button only to those users, whose browser supports it: 12345678910111213141516171819202122&lt;div class=&quot;&lt;%= class_name %&gt;&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;article-permalink&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&quot; data-id=&quot;&lt;%= post._id %&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;a id=&quot;action-copy&quot; class=&quot;article-action&quot; href=&quot;javascript:copyPermalink();&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a id=&quot;action-share&quot; class=&quot;article-action&quot; href=&quot;javascript:sharePermalink();&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt; function copyPermalink() &#123; -- SEE ABOVE &#125; if (navigator.share === undefined) &#123; var shareLink = document.querySelector(&quot;#action-share&quot;); shareLink.style.display = &quot;none&quot;; &#125; function sharePermalink() &#123; navigator.share(&#123; title: &quot;&lt;%- post.title %&gt;&quot;, url: &quot;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&quot;, &#125;) &#125;&lt;/script&gt; More Info w3c.github.io: W3C Web Share Testheise Developer: Features von übermorgen: Die Web Share API und die Web Share Target API (German)CSS-Tricks: How to Use the Web Share API","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"CSS","slug":"CSS","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/CSS/"},{"name":"Stylus","slug":"Stylus","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Stylus/"},{"name":"Share","slug":"Share","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Share/"}]},{"title":"Discoveries #2","subtitle":null,"series":"Discoveries","date":"2020-09-07","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Discoveries-2/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Discoveries-2/","excerpt":"New month, new discoveries.

The following approach works best in the Google Chrome browser. First, a Bookmarklet is a small piece of JavaScript, which is stored as a bookmark in your browser. As you can’t actually create such a Bookmarklet in your Android Chrome, you have to create it in your desktop Chrome and switch on the bookmark sync of chrome. You should right away choose a short, concise name for the bookmark, so you find it easier in Android Chrome afterwards. I called it 2TrelloCard, because few websites start with an number. After Chrome’s sync is done, go to any website do you want to store as a Trello card. Now enter the Url box and type the name of the bookmarklet and select it. Instead of requesting a different page, Chrome executes the JavaScript of the Bookmarklet against the currently open website. This script shows a Trello dialog, where you can choose, which board and list the new card should be created on. This card creation method not only sets the title of the card, but fills the description with the meta description of the page, adds the first found meta image as cover and adds the Url as an attachment:","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Browser","slug":"Browser","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Browser/"},{"name":"Trello","slug":"Trello","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Trello/"}]},{"title":"Horizontal navigation menu above an image","subtitle":"How to deal with coverage, readability and scrollbars","series":"A New Blog","date":"2020-07-20","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Horizontal-navigation-menu-above-an-image/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Horizontal-navigation-menu-above-an-image/","excerpt":"I changed the main menu of my blog, because I wanted to get rid of the hamburger menu on the upper left, which was shown only for smartphones, but was not really reachable conveniently.

As I have quite big header images and I wanted to place the new navigation in a more accessible zone, I decided to place it at the bottom, but above the header image. Problem was, not to cover a big part of the image with a full-colored or even semitransparent bar, by using a RGBA background color. I wanted it more translucent, but with enough contrast on bright images for the menu items to read. The recently introduced W3C feature backdrop-filter was just the right thing for that. It is supported by most modern browsers, but it has to have a backup strategy for the rest of the bunch. The HTML is simple: 1234567891011121314151617&lt;nav id=&quot;header-nav&quot; role=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;menu-item&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/first&quot; title=&quot;First&quot;&gt; &lt;span&gt;First Item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;menu-item&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/second&quot; title=&quot;Second&quot;&gt; &lt;span&gt;Second Item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/nav&gt; And here’s the Stylus code for my approach: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142#header-nav position: absolute bottom: 0 width: 100% height: auto box-sizing: content-box overflow-x: scroll overflow-y: hidden // BACKDROP-FILTER backdrop-filter: blur(5px) brightness(90%) @supports not (backdrop-filter: none) background: rgba(0,0,0,0.25) // SCROLLBAR &amp;::-webkit-scrollbar display: none @supports not (webkit-scrollbar) scrollbar-width: none .menu display: flex list-style: none margin: 0 padding: 0 .menu-item flex-basis: 80px flex-shrink: 0 flex-grow: 1 max-width: 100px margin: 0 2px text-overflow: ellipsis; a display: inline-block width: 100% padding: 10px 0 color: #ffffff font-weight: bold text-decoration: none text-align: center The navigation box is absolute positioned on the image, is as wide as the screen and scrolls exclusively horizontal. The items are a unordered list, with default width and arranged by flex. In case a browser doesn’t understand backdrop-filter, the navigation bar is shown with a classic alpha channel opacity. When having a horizontal scroll feature, the scrollbar shown by the browser is beyond beautiful. To prevent this, I used the CSS pseudo element ::-webkit-scrollbar, which is supported by WebKit and Blink bowsers, with a fallback for all other browsers. Both strategies allows to be still able to scroll. If you want to have a scrollbar, but not the built-in, I can only recommend to read something about styling scrollbars, like here and here.","categories":[{"name":"UI/UX","slug":"UI-UX","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/UI-UX/"}],"tags":[{"name":"CSS","slug":"CSS","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/CSS/"},{"name":"Stylus","slug":"Stylus","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Stylus/"}]},{"title":"Change CSS class when element scrolls into viewport","subtitle":null,"series":"A New Blog","date":"2020-07-13","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Change-CSS-class-when-element-scrolls-into-viewport/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Change-CSS-class-when-element-scrolls-into-viewport/","excerpt":"I had a neat visual gimmick on the start page of this blog, that the gray-scaled header image of a post in the list scaled up to 100% and became colored, when the user hovered over it: 123456789101112131415.article-inner .article-photo &#123; height: 150px; width: 100%; object-fit: cover; transform: scale(1); transform-style: preserve-3d; transition: all ease-out 0.6s; opacity: 0.3; filter: grayscale(1) contrast(0.5);&#125;.article-inner:hover .article-photo &#123; transform: scale(1.1); opacity: 1; filter: grayscale(0) contrast(1);&#125; Nice, but a little bit useless on smartphones or tablets, where HOVER doesn’t really work.","keywords":"neat visual gimmick start page blog gray-scaled header image post list scaled 100% colored user hovered 123456789101112131415article-inner article-photo &#123 height 150px width object-fit cover transform scale1 transform-style preserve-3d transition ease-out 06s opacity filter grayscale1 contrast05&#125article-innerhover scale11 grayscale0 contrast1&#125 nice bit useless smartphones tablets hover doesnt work","text":"I had a neat visual gimmick on the start page of this blog, that the gray-scaled header image of a post in the list scaled up to 100% and became colored, when the user hovered over it: 123456789101112131415.article-inner .article-photo &#123; height: 150px; width: 100%; object-fit: cover; transform: scale(1); transform-style: preserve-3d; transition: all ease-out 0.6s; opacity: 0.3; filter: grayscale(1) contrast(0.5);&#125;.article-inner:hover .article-photo &#123; transform: scale(1.1); opacity: 1; filter: grayscale(0) contrast(1);&#125; Nice, but a little bit useless on smartphones or tablets, where HOVER doesn’t really work.

As I host this blog at GitHub (see A New Blog (Part One): VS Code, Hexo and GitHub Pages) I was looking for a solution to host the comments also on my prefered platform. There were some solutions, which uses GitHub Issues for this and wanted to implement something like that someday. As I read a post from on Thomas Lavesques’ blog, to solve another problem, his commenting section came to my attention: utteranc.es … exactly the solution I needed! Thanx guys… On their website is a small configurator for a script to implement in each post, which needs only few information: Name of the Repo How the mapping of the post to the Issues should work Name of the Theme, in order to fit to the colors of the blog The script had to be included to my Hexo article.js: 123456789&lt;% if (!index &amp;&amp; post.comments)&#123; %&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://utteranc.es/client.js&quot; repo=&quot;kristofzerbe/kiko.io&quot; issue-term=&quot;pathname&quot; theme=&quot;github-light&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot; async&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;% &#125; %&gt; That’s pretty much it. On entering the first comment, Utterances told me to install the needed GitHub App to my repo, in order to make it work … and done. The result you see below … UPDATE…The utterances script tag has the attribute theme, to tell utterances which style should be delivered. There are several themes available, but if users are able to switch between light or dark mode on the page (see Hexo and the Dark Mode), the comment block should change to an suitable theme also. On order to respond on a mode change, it is necessary to write a more dynamic script loading. First we define a function in a global script file to load the utterances script via JS: 1234567891011121314151617181920function insertUtterancesCommentBlock() &#123; var commentTheme = &quot;github-light&quot;; if(localStorage.getItem(&quot;theme&quot;) === &quot;dark&quot;)&#123; commentTheme = &quot;github-dark&quot;; &#125; const scriptId = &quot;comment-theme-script&quot;; const existingScript = document.getElementById(scriptId); if (!existingScript) &#123; const commentScript = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); commentScript.id = scriptId; commentScript.src = &quot;https://utteranc.es/client.js&quot;; commentScript.setAttribute(&quot;repo&quot;, &quot;kristofzerbe/kiko.io&quot;); commentScript.setAttribute(&quot;issue-term&quot;, &quot;pathname&quot;); commentScript.setAttribute(&quot;theme&quot;, commentTheme); commentScript.setAttribute(&quot;crossorigin&quot;, &quot;anonymous&quot;); const placeholder = document.getElementById(&quot;comment-placeholder&quot;); placeholder.innerHTML = &quot;&quot;; placeholder.appendChild(commentScript); &#125;&#125; Then we change the placement in the EJS file, by defining a placeholder and ensuring that the script above is loaded, before we call it: 123456&lt;div id=&quot;comment-placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt; window.addEventListener(&#x27;load&#x27;, function () &#123; insertUtterancesCommentBlock(); &#125;)&lt;/script&gt; On my blog, everytime the user switches between light&#x2F;dark mode the body tag will be decorated with the data tag data-theme and the value of the mode. To keep the loading of the utterances script independent from this functionality, we just have to listen to this change via MutationObserver: 12345678910//observe theme change, to adjust comment block themevar target = document.documentElement, observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) &#123; mutations.forEach(function(mutation) &#123; if (mutation.attributionName === &quot;data-theme&quot; ); insertUtterancesCommentBlock(); &#125;); &#125;), config = &#123; attributes: true &#125;;observer.observe(target, config);","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"GitHub","slug":"GitHub","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/GitHub/"},{"name":"Blogging","slug":"Blogging","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Blogging/"}]},{"title":"Meaningful automatic versioning with T4","subtitle":"How to implement versioning in C# projects the better way","date":"2020-06-27","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/","excerpt":"Every developer has to have an idea of versioning his products.

This always should be set manually. Also the MINOR. It stands for significant functional extensions of the product. How does Visual Studio calculate BUILD and REVISION? When specifying a version, you have to at least specify major. If you specify major and minor, you can specify an asterisk for build. This will cause build to be equal to the number of days since January 1, 2000 local time, and for revision to be equal to the number of seconds since midnight local time, divided by 2. But, the BUILD number should explain, how often a software with a particular MAJOR.MINOR has been build, due to minor changes and bug fixes. The “Asterisk” REVISION number is a little weird, but at least with the BUILD number unique. But it says nothing. Better to pick up the idea of a date calculated, unique number, but not an arbitrary date … let’s take the date the project has started. For example: 1.2.16.158 … reads version 1.2 with 16 builds on the 158’th day after the project has started. Start with T4T4 (Text Template Transformation Toolkit) is a templating system in Visual Studio for generating text files during design time. It is very suitable to even generate code. Read about it here and here. A Text Template (.tt) has Directives (how the template is processed), Text blocks (text copied to the output) and Control blocks (program code). For our versioning template, we start with this in a new file named AssemblyVersion.tt: Directives: 12&lt;#@ template hostspecific=&quot;true&quot; language=&quot;C#&quot; #&gt;&lt;#@ output extension=&quot;.cs&quot; #&gt; Control block: 123456&lt;# int major = 1; int minor = 0; int build = 0; int revision = 0;#&gt; Text block: 1234567// This code was generated by a tool. Any changes made manually will be lost// the next time this code is regenerated.using System.Reflection;[assembly: AssemblyVersion(&quot;&lt;#= $&quot;&#123;major&#125;.&#123;minor&#125;.&#123;build&#125;.&#123;revision&#125;&quot; #&gt;&quot;)][assembly: AssemblyFileVersion(&quot;&lt;#= $&quot;&#123;major&#125;.&#123;minor&#125;.&#123;build&#125;.&#123;revision&#125;&quot; #&gt;&quot;)] On saving the TT file, a new CS file with the same name will be created automatically and you got an error like this: A new place for version infoTh error occurs, because we have now two AssemblyVersion and AssemblyFileVersion attributes in our project. We need to comment out the original in Properties\\AssemblyInfo.cs: Structural ConsiderationsIt makes sense to store all needed files for the new versioning system in a new root folder of the project, named AssemblyVersion, starting with the AssemblyVersion.tt, because there will be more files later on. New app information fileAs we replaced the original version attributes in the project with those from our generated AssemblyVersion.cs, we cannot control the MAJOR and MINOR version number via the project property dialog any longer. We need a new approach on that, which can be edited easily and processed automatically. AssemblyVersion.json1234567891011121314151617&#123; &quot;initialDate&quot;: &quot;2019-09-29&quot;, &quot;versions&quot;: [ &#123; &quot;major&quot;: 1, &quot;minor&quot;: 1, &quot;releaseDate&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;remarks&quot;: &quot;Some cool new features; New versioning system&quot; &#125;, &#123; &quot;major&quot;: 1, &quot;minor&quot;: 0, &quot;releaseDate&quot;: &quot;2019-10-01&quot;, &quot;remarks&quot;: &quot;Initial Release&quot; &#125; ]&#125; This new JSON file has two main items: initialDate - the date the project has started, to calculate the REVISION later on versions - a list with all different MAJOR&#x2F;MINOR versions we have done so far, with at least one without a release date … the one with the highest major and minor. The remarks attribute of a list item holds some information about the changes in a new version. Together with releaseDate, useful for a possible release history, shown in the product itself. Library references in T4T4 runs in its own app domain, therefore it can use built-in libraries as System.IO, but not third-party libraries like Newtonsoft.JSON. We could reference those libraries from the projects package folder via the absolute path (if we use it in our product), but when we are running a NuGet update, the reference will break. It is advisable to store such libraries directly in a fixed folder, like AssemblyVersion\\Libraries. They won’t have any impact to our product, because the are only used while design time. The MAJOR and MINORTo process the new AssemblyVersion.json in the template, we need some new directives for referencing the needed libraries and the import of the appropriate namepaces: 123456&lt;#@ assembly name=&quot;System.Core&quot; #&gt;&lt;#@ assembly name=&quot;$(SolutionDir)\\AssemblyVersion\\Libraries\\Newtonsoft.Json.dll&quot; #&gt;&lt;#@ import namespace=&quot;System.IO&quot; #&gt;&lt;#@ import namespace=&quot;System.Linq&quot; #&gt;&lt;#@ import namespace=&quot;Newtonsoft.Json&quot; #&gt; Via the use of the T4 variable $(SolutionDir), we can point to our copy of Newtonsoft JSON. Now we can read and convert the JSON into an anonymous object and get the highest values of MAJOR and MINOR: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728&lt;# string avPath = this.Host.ResolvePath(&quot;AssemblyVersion.json&quot;); string avJson = File.ReadAllText(avPath); var avDefinition = new &#123; initialDate = &quot;&quot;, versions = new [] &#123; new &#123; major = 0, minor = 0, releaseDate = &quot;&quot;, remarks = &quot;&quot; &#125; &#125; &#125;; var avObject = JsonConvert.DeserializeAnonymousType(avJson, avDefinition); //Get highest Major/Minor from versions list var maxVersion = avObject.versions .OrderByDescending(i =&gt; i.major) .ThenByDescending(j =&gt; j.minor) .First(); //Set MAJOR int major = maxVersion.major; //Set MINOR int minor = maxVersion.minor;#&gt; The BuildLogIn order to get the version number for BUILD, we need a method to count and store every build that has been run, separated by the MAJOR&#x2F;MINOR versions. This is a job for a Post-build event, which can be configured in the project properties dialog. The event uses shell commands as they are used on the command line. What the commands should do:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Write a new line with the current date and time in a log file, named after the MAJOR&#x2F;MINOR version and stored in the folder AssemblyVersion\\BuildLogs. Extending build event macrosShell commands for build events are supporting built-in variables, so called ‘macros’, like $(ProjectDir) (which returns the project directory path), but there is no such macro for the current version number. We have to introduce it via extending the project with a new build target. Unload the project in Visual Studio for editing the CSPROJ (or VBPROJ) file of your product manually and write the following definition just before the end-tag: 123456789101112131415&lt;PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;PostBuildEventDependsOn&gt; $(PostBuildEventDependsOn); PostBuildMacros; &lt;/PostBuildEventDependsOn&gt;&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;&lt;Target Name=&quot;PostBuildMacros&quot;&gt; &lt;GetAssemblyIdentity AssemblyFiles=&quot;$(TargetPath)&quot;&gt; &lt;Output TaskParameter=&quot;Assemblies&quot; ItemName=&quot;Targets&quot; /&gt; &lt;/GetAssemblyIdentity&gt; &lt;ItemGroup&gt; &lt;VersionNumber Include=&quot;@(Targets-&gt;&#x27;%(Version)&#x27;)&quot; /&gt; &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;&lt;/Target&gt; After reloading the project in Visual Studio, we can use @(VersionNumber) in our commands. CreateBuildLog.batThe event build editor is not very comfortable, so we create the batch file CreateBuildLog.bat in our AssemblyVersion folder and use this as the post build event command. The BuildLog folder must exist, before running the following command the first time! 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627@echo offREM --Get parametersset PROJECT_DIR=%1set VERSION_NUMBER=%2REM --Set what to logset LOG_LINE=%DATE% %TIME%REM --Inform the userset MSG=CreateBuildLog &#x27;%LOG_LINE%&#x27; for version %VERSION_NUMBER%echo %MSG%REM --Get version partsFOR /f &quot;tokens=1,2,3,4 delims=.&quot; %%a IN (&quot;%VERSION_NUMBER%&quot;) do ( set MAJOR=%%a set MINOR=%%b set BUILD=%%c set REVISION=%%d)REM --Define BuildLog file and folder set BUILDLOG_FILE=%MAJOR%.%MINOR%.logset BUILDLOG_FOLDER=%PROJECT_DIR%\\AssemblyVersion\\BuildLogsREM --Write current date and time as new line in the fileecho %LOG_LINE% &gt;&gt; %BUILDLOG_FOLDER%\\%BUILDLOG_FILE%&quot; 1&quot;$(ProjectDir)\\AssemblyVersion\\CreateBuildLog.bat&quot; &quot;$(ProjectDir)&quot; @(VersionNumber) The BUILDAs we have now the BuildLogs, we can use them in the template: 123456789101112131415161718192021&lt;# ... //Get BuildLog of max version string buildlogFolder = this.Host.ResolvePath(&quot;BuildLogs&quot;); string buildLog = buildlogFolder + &quot;\\\\&quot; + maxVersion.major + &quot;.&quot; + maxVersion.minor + &quot;.log&quot;; //Get number of lines from BuildLog or create a new log (!) var buildCount = 1; if (File.Exists(buildLog)) &#123; buildCount = File.ReadLines(buildLog).Count() + 1; &#125; else &#123; File.Create(buildLog).Dispose(); &#125; //Set BUILD int build = buildCount;#&gt; Very important is to create the log file, if it doesn’t exists! Otherwise the build will always fail, because the version attributes can’t be created. The REVISIONAt least we have to set the REVISION number, by calculating the difference between the current date and the initialDate, which we have previously read from the AssemblyVersion.json: 1234567&lt;# ... //Set REVISION var dateCreated = DateTime.Parse(avObject.initialDate); int revision = (DateTime.Now.Date - dateCreated.Date).Days;#&gt; Transforming T4 template on buildThe last hurdle is to run the text transformation every time you build your product. Until now it runs only on saving the AssemblyVersion.tt. A great helper on that was Thomas Levesque’s post “Transform T4 templates as part of the build, and pass variables from the project”, where he describes every difficulty to reach this goal. To make it short: We have to edit the CSPROJ file again, to introduce TextTemplating to MSBuild. First we need following near the beginning of the projects XML: 1234567891011&lt;PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;VisualStudioVersion Condition=&quot;&#x27;$(VisualStudioVersion)&#x27; == &#x27;&#x27;&quot;&gt; 16.0 &lt;/VisualStudioVersion&gt; &lt;VSToolsPath Condition=&quot;&#x27;$(VSToolsPath)&#x27; == &#x27;&#x27;&quot;&gt; $(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v$(VisualStudioVersion) &lt;/VSToolsPath&gt; &lt;TransformOnBuild&gt;true&lt;/TransformOnBuild&gt; &lt;OverwriteReadOnlyOutputFiles&gt;true&lt;/OverwriteReadOnlyOutputFiles&gt; &lt;TransformOutOfDateOnly&gt;false&lt;/TransformOutOfDateOnly&gt;&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt; Secondly add the IMPORT of the TextTemplating target AFTER the CSharp target: 123&lt;Import Project=&quot;$(MSBuildToolsPath)\\Microsoft.CSharp.targets&quot; /&gt;...&lt;Import Project=&quot;$(VSToolsPath)\\TextTemplating\\Microsoft.TextTemplating.targets&quot; /&gt; If you build your product now, a new build log is created and the version numbers BUILD and REVISION are automatically increased.

Pooling ImagesAs it is time consuming to generate the necessary images, I have created another static folder pool to store prepared files and a text file with the additional information about the image. The structure of pool is different to photos, because of my image workflow and some limitations of automating the provisioning. 12345678| static/ | pool/ | my-lovely-picture/ | meta.txt | mobile.jpg | normal.jpg | tablet.jpg | ... The meta.txt is a simple text file with two lines of text: first the name of the image and second the Url to link to, which will be inserted in the appropriate Frontmatter fields on creating a new post: 12My Lovely Imagehttps://500px.com/photo/123456789/My-Lovely-Image Automate binding and provisioning on new postDevelopers are lazy and I do not make an exception. Having all these pool images and the meta informations, it would be nice, if Hexo just picks and processes one of the pool folders automatically, when I’m creating a new post by calling hexo new &quot;My shiny new post&quot; … and it was easier then I thought. Where to place the code for the automatismHexo has a great API to write plugins and it is not very difficult to setup a new plugin for this, which can be published to the NPM registry. But it is also possible to extend Hexo’s functionality by using a simple script. All you need is a script folder in the root of your Hexo project. Any JS files which is placed there, will be executed by Hexo. Therefore, lets use a script called \\scripts\\process-photo-on-new.js … Things an automatism should do - Step by Step Hook into the creation of a post Pick randomly one of the pool images Place the content of the meta.txt in the Frontmatter Move the 3 device-dependend images into the photos folder Step 1 - Hook into the creation of a postThe needed event, the automatism can hook on, is: 123hexo.on(&#x27;new&#x27;, function(data)&#123; //&#125;); It will be executed every time you call the hexo new command. The parameter data is an object with two fields: pathFull path to the MD file of the new post contentComplete content of the scaffold (template), which Hexo has used to create the new post; default is /scaffolds/post.md. By preloading the Hexo Front matter library and parsing data.content we get access to the definition of the new post: 1234567const front = require(&#x27;hexo-front-matter&#x27;);hexo.on(&#x27;new&#x27;, function(post)&#123; // parse article content var post = front.parse(data.content);&#125;); Step 2 - Pick randomly one of the pool imagesThere are some build-in variables to get the full path, for example, of the source folder, we can use to define the needed paths to the pool and the photo folder. 123456789const front = require(&#x27;hexo-front-matter&#x27;);hexo.on(&#x27;new&#x27;, function(post)&#123; var post = front.parse(data.content); // set the path variables var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;pool&quot;; var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;photos&quot;;&#125;); Next, we need to preload the Hexo FS library for file access, to list the content of the poolDir, including the subfolders, and filter out the meta files. Out of the resulting array we pick one randomly, to use for the new post: 123456789101112131415161718192021const front = require(&#x27;hexo-front-matter&#x27;);const fs = require(&#x27;hexo-fs&#x27;);hexo.on(&#x27;new&#x27;, function(post)&#123; var post = front.parse(data.content); var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;pool&quot;; var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;photos&quot;; // list all files var files = fs.listDirSync(poolDir); // filter the list to get meta files of each subfolder var metaFiles = files.filter(file =&gt; file.match(/.*[\\\\]meta.txt/g)); // pick one randomly var metaFile = metaFiles[Math.floor(Math.random() * metaFiles.length)]; // get the name of the picked photo (foldername) var photoName = metaFile.split(&quot;\\\\&quot;)[0];&#125;); Step 3 - Place the content of the meta.txt in the FrontmatterNow we have to read the meta file, place the data in the Frontmatter and save the article file: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930const front = require(&#x27;hexo-front-matter&#x27;);const fs = require(&#x27;hexo-fs&#x27;);hexo.on(&#x27;new&#x27;, function(post)&#123; var post = front.parse(data.content); var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;pool&quot;; var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;photos&quot;; var files = fs.listDirSync(poolDir); var metaFiles = files.filter(file =&gt; file.match(/.*[\\\\]meta.txt/g)); var metaFile = metaFiles[Math.floor(Math.random() * metaFiles.length)]; var photoName = metaFile.split(&quot;\\\\&quot;)[0]; // read meta file var meta = fs.readFileSync(poolDir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + metaFile); var metas = meta.split(&quot;\\n&quot;); // place file and additional info in the Frontmatter post.photograph.file = photoName + &quot;.jpg&quot;; post.photograph.name = metas[0]; post.photograph.link = metas[1]; // convert content back postStr = front.stringify(post); postStr = &#x27;---\\n&#x27; + postStr; // store article fs.writeFile(data.path, postStr, &#x27;utf-8&#x27;);&#125;); Step 4 - Move the 3 device-dependend images into the photos folderLast but not least, we have to move the pool images into the photos folder and remove the pool folder with all its processed content: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051const front = require(&#x27;hexo-front-matter&#x27;);const fs = require(&#x27;hexo-fs&#x27;);hexo.on(&#x27;new&#x27;, function(post)&#123; var post = front.parse(data.content); var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;pool&quot;; var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;photos&quot;; var files = fs.listDirSync(poolDir); var metaFiles = files.filter(file =&gt; file.match(/.*[\\\\]meta.txt/g)); var metaFile = metaFiles[Math.floor(Math.random() * metaFiles.length)]; var photoName = metaFile.split(&quot;\\\\&quot;)[0]; var meta = fs.readFileSync(poolDir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + metaFile); var metas = meta.split(&quot;\\n&quot;); post.photograph.file = photoName + &quot;.jpg&quot;; post.photograph.name = metas[0]; post.photograph.link = metas[1]; postStr = front.stringify(post); postStr = &#x27;---\\n&#x27; + postStr; fs.writeFile(data.path, postStr, &#x27;utf-8&#x27;); //copy normal image fs.copyFile( poolDir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + photoName + &quot;\\\\normal.jpg&quot;, photosDir + &quot;\\\\normal\\\\&quot; + photoName + &quot;.jpg&quot;, function() &#123; //copy tablet image fs.copyFile( poolDir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + photoName + &quot;\\\\tablet.jpg&quot;, photosDir + &quot;\\\\tablet\\\\&quot; + photoName + &quot;.jpg&quot;, function() &#123; //copy mobile image fs.copyFile( poolDir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + photoName + &quot;\\\\mobile.jpg&quot;, photosDir + &quot;\\\\mobile\\\\&quot; + photoName + &quot;.jpg&quot;, function() &#123; //remove processed pool folder fs.rmdirSync(poolDir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + photoName); &#125;); &#125;); &#125;);&#125;); Now it so easy to write a new post, because almost everything is set and I can concentrate on the article. Also, it is a nice surprise to see, which photo the script has chosen. The only thing I have to do from time to time, is to refill the pool folder with new images.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"Blogging","slug":"Blogging","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Blogging/"}]},{"title":"Localization with resource files in JavaScript web apps","subtitle":"How to work with Visual Studio resource files for localization in Single Page Applications","date":"2020-06-13","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Localization-with-resource-files-in-JavaScript-web-apps/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Localization-with-resource-files-in-JavaScript-web-apps/","excerpt":"There are plenty of editors out there to help you writing JavaScript web applications.

As I’m working in my daily life with Visual Studio, it is a obvious choice for me. One of the most time saving tools in VS is the plugin ResXManager, which is an awesome assistant on managing the translations for a Desktop- or ASP.NET-App, which uses XML-based RESX files. Mostly very localization is based on key&#x2F;value pairs, defined in separate files for every language provided. Implementing several languages in pure JavaScript apps is a little more difficult, because it makes no sense to deal with big XML files in JS. All localization libraries in the market uses JSON for storing the translations and it is a little bit of work to find the right one for your requirements. Localization in JavaScriptFor a current project I use jquery-lang, because it provides the switch of the apps UI language without reloading and it is easy to implement. Thanks Rob Evans for your work… The definition of “tokens” in one JSON file for each language is quite easy: ../languages/en.json12345&#123; &quot;token&quot;: &#123; &quot;my-test&quot;: &quot;My Test in English&quot; &#125;&#125; ../languages/de.json12345&#123; &quot;token&quot;: &#123; &quot;my-test&quot;: &quot;Mein Test in Deutsch&quot; &#125;&#125; The usage also: 1&lt;div lang=&quot;en&quot; data-lang-token=&quot;my-test&quot;&gt; Using RESX and convert to JSON on buildHaving this, the most time consuming work is to enter the translations to the localization files. If you have hundreds of them, it is hard to keep the 2, 3 or more language files in sync. You need a helper… And here comes ResXManager to the rescue, if you work with VS … but it needs a conversation from RESX to the JSON format jquery-lang uses and this a task, which can be done on building the JS app, by using a task runner like Grunt. As there was no Grunt plugin&#x2F;task out there to fit my needs, I have created grunt-resource2json (GitHub, NPM). The configuration in the gruntfile.js is like: gruntfile.js12345678910111213141516171819202122grunt.initConfig(&#123; resource2json: &#123; convert: &#123; options: &#123; format: &quot;jquery-lang&quot; &#125;, files: [ &#123; input: &quot;resources/Resource.resx&quot;, output: &quot;build/langpacks/en.json&quot; &#125;, &#123; input: &quot;resources/Resource.de-DE.resx&quot;, output: &quot;build/langpacks/de.json&quot; &#125;, &#123; input: &quot;resources/Resource.es-ES.resx&quot;, output: &quot;build/langpacks/es.json&quot; &#125; ] &#125; &#125;); It takes one RESX file (input) and converts it to a JSON file (output) in an array of files. The heavy work in the plugin is done by the library xml2js, which transforms the complete XML of the RESX file into a JSON object in one call. All I had to do, was to write all DATA nodes in a loop into the jquery-lang given structure and save it as JSON. Currently supported is the format for jquery-lang only, but it would be awesome, if you fork the code on GitHub and send me a Pull Request with the implementation of your needed format.","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/"}],"tags":[{"name":"GitHub","slug":"GitHub","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/GitHub/"},{"name":"Visual Studio","slug":"Visual-Studio","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Visual-Studio/"},{"name":"Resource","slug":"Resource","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Resource/"},{"name":"Localization","slug":"Localization","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Localization/"}]},{"title":"TFS/DevOps: Delete Remote Workspace","subtitle":null,"date":"2020-02-27","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/TFS-DevOps-Delete-Remote-Workspace/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/TFS-DevOps-Delete-Remote-Workspace/","excerpt":"If you are working with freelance developers and Azure DevOps&#x2F;TFS with TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control) in your company, maybe this will look familiar to you: You hire a new freelancer and you want to reuse the hardware, including the complete software setup, to bring him&#x2F;her to work as fast and straightforward as possible.

You set up a new Azure Devops account with all necessary permissions and you think you’re done. No you are not… Everytime a user connects to a Team Project on Azure DevOps via Visual Studio and gets the code, VS is creating a remote workspace on the server, with the machine name as default, therefor it is not enough to wipe the profile and any other legacies of the last user from the machine. You also have to remove the remote workspace. Otherwise you will get an error message like that, if you are using a unique file structure on the developers hard disc: 1The working folder c://xxx is already in use by the workspace yyy;zzz on computer yyy The variable xxx stands for the blocked folder, yyy for the workspace&#x2F;machine name and zzz for the users id on Azure DevOps. Unfortunately, there is no visual management console on Azure DevOps to manage your server workspaces, but there is a command line tool called tf.exe. The easiest way to get rid of the unused server workspace in 3 steps: Step 1Run Developer Command Prompt with Administrator privileges from Visual Studio 2019 and login with your Azure DevOps credentials. If the Login dialog doesn’t show up, force it by executing: 1tf.exe workspace Step 2Get a list of all remote workspaces available in your DevOps Collection by running the command: 1tf.exe workspaces /computer:* /owner:* /format:xml &gt; c:\\temp\\workspaces.xml You can get a list of all your workspaces by running tf workspaces, but the list only shows you the owner, but not the necessary ownerid and … it is nicer to have a file to search in. Step 3Find the abandoned workspace in the list and note its name and ownerid for running the command: 1tf workspace /delete &#123;WORKSPACE.name&#125;;&#123;WORKSPACE.ownerid&#125; Now your new colleague can create his own workspace on the same machine. UpdateIn case you want to switch your own DevOps account to another and use the same folder as before, you can certainly delete the local workspace, but this wont help, because you are still logged in at TeamExplorer and the folder knows to whom it belongs. Solution is easy: Quit Visual Studio Rename folder in ***_OLD or something Create new folder with the same name Enter C:\\Users\\YOUR-NAME\\appdata\\Local\\Microsoft\\Team Foundation\\VS-VERSION\\Cache and emtpy the folder to let Visual Studio forget who you are Remove all your Remote Workspaces as described above Start Visual Studio, connect in TeamExplorer to your TFS server and map the code to your folder More Info Microsoft Docs: Use Team Foundation version control commandsStackoverflow: How to remove TFS workspace mapping for another user","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Visual Studio","slug":"Visual-Studio","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Visual-Studio/"},{"name":"TFS/DevOps","slug":"TFS-DevOps","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/TFS-DevOps/"}]},{"title":"Better Input Change Event","subtitle":null,"date":"2019-11-26","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Better-Input-Change-Event/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Better-Input-Change-Event/","excerpt":"Often it is important to trigger an event, after the user of your website&#x2F;web app has filled out an text input.

A better way to show the user the result of his entered value, could be the event input which fires on every key stroke, but could be way to often, if the triggered event is for example an AJAX call. Best solution is, to observe the users key strokes and trigger the event, when he stops typing. Then there is no extra action needed by the user and the event isn’t triggered multiple times. Here’s an implementation with jQuery: 12345678910$(&quot;#my-text-input&quot;).keyup(function () &#123; var $this = $(this); clearTimeout($.data(this, &#x27;timer&#x27;)); var wait = setTimeout(function () &#123; //do something with the value... &#125;, 1000); $(this).data(&#x27;timer&#x27;, wait);&#125;); Important is to wipe and set the timer on every key up, to achive that the event will be executed after 1 second after the last key stroke only.","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/"}],"tags":[{"name":"jQuery","slug":"jQuery","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/jQuery/"}]},{"title":"Hexo and the Dark Mode ... revised","subtitle":"Second approach to implement 'prefers-color-scheme'","series":"A New Blog","date":"2019-10-26","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode-revised/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode-revised/","excerpt":"While writing my post Hexo and the Dark Mode a few days ago, I thought it would be nice, if I could switch between the normal (light) and the dark theme, I’ve created for the support of the OS-related Dark Mode, even manually.

I wrapped all necessary code into a seperate JS file and placed a reference in the after-footer.ejs, which places it at the bottom of the HTML: 1&lt;%- js(&#x27;js/dark-mode-toggle.js&#x27;) %&gt; 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758function detectColorScheme() &#123; var theme = &quot;light&quot;; //default // get last used theme from local cache if(localStorage.getItem(&quot;theme&quot;))&#123; if(localStorage.getItem(&quot;theme&quot;) === &quot;dark&quot;)&#123; theme = &quot;dark&quot;; &#125; &#125; else if(!window.matchMedia) &#123; // matchMedia not supported return false; &#125; else if(window.matchMedia(&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot;).matches) &#123; // OS has set Dark Mode theme = &quot;dark&quot;; &#125; // set detected theme if (theme === &quot;dark&quot;) &#123; setThemeDark(); &#125; else &#123; setThemeLight(); &#125;&#125;const toggleTheme = document.querySelector(&#x27;input#theme-switch[type=&quot;checkbox&quot;]&#x27;);function setThemeDark() &#123; localStorage.setItem(&#x27;theme&#x27;, &#x27;dark&#x27;); document.documentElement.setAttribute(&#x27;data-theme&#x27;, &#x27;dark&#x27;); toggleTheme.checked = true;&#125;function setThemeLight() &#123; localStorage.setItem(&#x27;theme&#x27;, &#x27;light&#x27;); document.documentElement.setAttribute(&#x27;data-theme&#x27;, &#x27;light&#x27;); toggleTheme.checked = false;&#125;// Listener for theme change by toggletoggleTheme.addEventListener(&#x27;change&#x27;, function(e) &#123; if (e.target.checked) &#123; setThemeDark(); &#125; else &#123; setThemeLight(); &#125;&#125;, false);// Listener for theme change by OSvar toggleOS = window.matchMedia(&#x27;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&#x27;);toggleOS.addEventListener(&#x27;change&#x27;, function (e) &#123; if (e.matches) &#123; setThemeDark(); &#125; else &#123; setThemeLight(); &#125;&#125;);// call theme detectiondetectColorScheme(); By using the both addEventListener‘s, each switch will be recognized and this approach is capable to support even more themes, just by using different values in the data-theme attribute.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"CSS","slug":"CSS","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/CSS/"},{"name":"Stylus","slug":"Stylus","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Stylus/"},{"name":"Dark Mode","slug":"Dark-Mode","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Dark-Mode/"}]},{"title":"Hexo and the Dark Mode","subtitle":"First approach to implement 'prefers-color-scheme'","series":"A New Blog","date":"2019-10-23","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode/","excerpt":"Due to the fact, that nowadays everybody is talking about Dark Modes for Browsers and Operating Systems, in order to save battery or for easier reading (uhh, really?), I decided my blog should support that.","keywords":"due fact nowadays talking dark modes browsers operating systems order save battery easier reading uhh decided blog support","text":"Due to the fact, that nowadays everybody is talking about Dark Modes for Browsers and Operating Systems, in order to save battery or for easier reading (uhh, really?), I decided my blog should support that. Starting point is the new media query prefers-color-scheme, which is actually supported by all modern browsers. TechniqueMy first read was Tom Brow’s Dark mode in a website with CSS, where he shows how to use the media query. Simplified, this is it, assuming the light version is the default: 1234567891011body &#123; background-color: white; color: black;&#125;@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) &#123; body &#123; background-color: black; color: white; &#125;&#125; Pimping CSS for automatic switchingTo support the automatic browser&#x2F;OS-based automatic switch in Hexo, where Stylus is used, I had to change some template files. First the _variables.styl: 1234567891011121314// existing color variablescolor-background = #f1f1f1color-foreground = #111color-border = #ddd...// new dark color variablesdark-color-background = #111dark-color-foreground = #eeedark-color-border = #000...// new media query variableprefers-dark = &quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; Next step was to change the _extend.styl, where some Stylus variables are defining complete blocks to extend. Here I had to supplement all lines, where something mode-dependend was defined, by adding the new prefers-dark media query and beneath the new ‘dark’ equivalence of the style: 12345678910111213141516171819$base-style hr ... border: 1px dashed color-border-article @media prefers-dark border: 1px dashed dark-color-border-article ...$block ... background: color-block box-shadow: 1px 2px 3px color-border border: 1px solid color-border @media prefers-dark background: dark-color-block box-shadow: 1px 2px 3px dark-color-border border-color: dark-color-border... The same changes I had to do in every template styl file, where one of the colors or other mode dependent style was used. For example: 12345678#mobile-nav-header background-color: color-background @media prefers-dark background-color: dark-color-background img.avatar ... @media prefers-dark filter: brightness(85%) This will be rendered as: 123456789101112131415#mobile-nav-header &#123; background-color: #f1f1f1;&#125;@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) &#123; #mobile-nav-header &#123; background-color: #111; &#125;&#125;#mobile-nav-header img.avatar &#123; ...&#125;@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) &#123; filter: brightness(85%);&#125; Please note the use of filter:brightness() in the example. It is always advisable to darken the images too, because they can really pop out on dark backgrounds.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"CSS","slug":"CSS","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/CSS/"},{"name":"Stylus","slug":"Stylus","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Stylus/"},{"name":"Dark Mode","slug":"Dark-Mode","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Dark-Mode/"}]},{"title":"A New Blog: Blogging and Synching en route","subtitle":"Part Three of having fun with Hexo and GitHub Pages","series":"A New Blog","date":"2019-09-30","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/","excerpt":"I work with several devices, some Windows, some Android, and sometimes I have time to write on my articles at home (Notebook, Tablet), in my spare time in the office (Desktop, Laptop) or on my way to somewhere (Smartphone).

Right now I’m am in a barber shop, waiting for my haircut and write these lines. So, wherever I am, I need the Hexo project locally, but in sync on a digital device. The blog is synced via Dropbox, but hosted on GitHub Pages, so on every device I need the publishing functions of Git too. Sync Hexo ProjectBest option for me to achieve this was Dropbox. Another benefit on that is: I can work on the structure of the blog wherever I am and commit when the new feature or improvement is done, because all Git related files are always in sync too. Writing, Editing and Publishing on WindowsMy preferred editor is Visual Studio Code. Good file handling, easy writing, full Git integration and tons of other plugins and helpers. Chapeau Microsoft, well done. Some of the following VS Code plugins makes working with Hexo on GitHub pages a breeze: Adds Hexo commands like init, new, generate, server and clean to the VS Code command palette. Keyboard shortcuts for basic formatting, automatic list editing, autocomlete for images, table formatter and much more for an easier handling of Markdown. Markdown linting and style checking Adds syntax highlighting and code completion to Stylus files Complete visual management of your repositories in VS Code View a Git Graph of your repository with all changes and manage commits. With this editor and its helpers, I’m just two clicks away from publishing a new article or even a new version of the Hexo blog itself. Writing on AndroidThere are a lot of Markdown editors available on Google Play, but one is outstanding: iA Writer for Android. I can open my posts or drafts directly from Dropbox, without the need of any sychronization. Open, write, close, done. Publishing on AndroidThere are some Git related Android apps out there, but no solution was satisfying. Furthermore, I didn’t really need Git here, because I didn’t want to have all source files on my smartphone. I’m working directly on the Dropbox stored MD files via iA Writer. Finally and most important, Git won’t be enough, because before publishing, I have to run hexo generate! Therefore some sort of automatic transfer from Dropbox to GitHub is also out of the game. What I needed, was to tell a server at a certain point of time ‘Hey, please publish for me’, using the only connection I have: Dropbox. Introducing a DemonI have a little media server, running on Windows, and he is synchronizing some folders with Dropbox. He could do the job! After I installed all necessary packages, like NodeJS, Hexo and Git, I included the project folder into the sync. Next step was to design a so called Hexo Command File, a simple TXT file, which holds commands in single lines, extended with execution times, when they were successfully running. 12345postdraft: A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-routepublishnewdraft: &quot;A New Blog: Blogging and Synching en route&quot; @ 2019-09-30 21:15regenerate @ 2019-09-29 16:40:01publish @ 2019-09-29 16:40:10 These commands are predefined, because they bundle several real commands and I didn’t want to deal with real commands, due to security reasons. The unprocessed commands are standing at the top of the file (in execution order!) and parameters are separated from the command by a colon and delimited by commas. &lt;command&gt;: [&lt;param1&gt;, ...] @ &lt;execution time&gt; Next step was to create a program to work as an executing demon, who monitors the Hexo Command File (synced by Dropbox) on my server and executes commands without execution dates. I decided to create a simple Console Application in C# and use the built-in Windows Task Scheduler for running it every 2 minutes. The application is called HexoCommander and is available at GitHub. It expects the Hexo Command File to be named hexo-commands.txt, located in the same folder, and provides the following commands: newdraft: “&lt;title&gt;” … runs hexo new draft &quot;&lt;title&gt;&quot; Creates a new draft. postdraft: “&lt;filename without extension&gt;” … runs hexo publish &quot;&lt;filename without extension&gt;&quot; Makes a post out of a draft. regenerate … runs hexo clean hexo generate Wipes all Hexo static pages and generates them new. publish … runs hexo generate git add &quot;source/*&quot; &quot;docs/*&quot; git commit -m &quot;Remote publication via HexoCommander&quot; git push origin master Generates Hexo static pages, stage changes on drafts, posts and static pages, commits the changes with a generic message and pushes them to the server. Running the demonI would have never expected, that the trickiest part was to get HexoCommander running via Windows Task Scheduler. What a mess! I finally find the solution here: Compile HexoCommander in a x86 configuration Create a new task in Task Scheduler with Trigger Dialy Recur every 1 days Repeat task every 2 minutes for a duration of 1 day Action Program&#x2F;Script: %systemroot%\\Syswow64\\cmd.exe Add Arguments: &#x2F;C “C:\\MyPath\\HexoCommander.exe &#x2F;workdir&#x3D;C:\\MyPath” Start In: %systemroot%\\Syswow64\\ Because some executing commands in the chain are NOT 64-bit, I had to force Task Scheduler to run the 32-bit Command Shell in its own path (see ‘Start In’ and don’t forget the closing backslash) and take the 32-bit compiled HexoCommander as argument after the parameter /C (forcing command to terminate), including its own argument for defining the real working directory.

I will show you which of these I found worth to work with… Relative Image PathThe build-in way to include images in your posts works fine, but it is a little aside the normal way to declare images in Markdown. The plugin [Hexo Asset Link] corrects that. After installing via npm install hexo-asset-link --save you can write this: ![Test Image](hello-world/image-1.png) The best is, that VS Code’s Markdown can now show the image. UPDATE:Actually the plugin destroys external links, so don’t use it until this is fixed … or go to node_modules &gt; hexo-asset-link &gt; index.js in your project and change in line 22 protocal to protocol. UPDATE from Update:liolok, the author of the plugin has merged my pull request and published a new new version without the typo. It works now as expected. Hide PostsA new Hexo project comes with a sample post called Hello World. This is fine to play around with, but you don’t want to publish it. Here comes a Hexo plugin to the rescue called Hexo Hide Posts. After installing, you just have to write hidden: true to the Front Matter of you post and it won’t be shown on the blog, but it is still available by URL. Static FilesHexo has the concept of Assets Folders, but for static files, beside article based files, I find it more useful to have a STATIC folder and copy the contents on every build into the publish folder. A good helper for this approach is the plugin Hexo Generator Copy. Install it by running npm install hexo-generator-copy --save and add static_dir: static to your _config.yml and you are done. ![Hexo Static Files](/post/A-New-Blog-Customizing-Hexo/vscode-1.png) FeedThe default Hexo layout has an Atom Feed icon in the upper right corner, but strangely no feed file is generated on build. You need to install the plugin Hexo Feed Generator to fix this, by running npm install hexo-generator-feed --save and copy following section into the _config.yml: 123456789feed: type: atom path: atom.xml limit: 20 hub: content: content_limit: 140 content_limit_delim: &#x27; &#x27; order_by: -date Manifest for PWAIn these modern times it’s always a good idea, that your blog feels like an App. For this you need a manifest file (JSON) an several icons (PNG). You can generate these files very fast with the Web App Manifest Generator and store it in your static folder. To bind this file into your blog, you can use the plugin Hexo PWA. Run npm install --save hexo-pwa and copy following section to your _config.yml, where you take the settings from your generated manifest file: 1234567891011121314151617pwa: manifest: path: /manifest.json body: name: myblog.de short_name: My Blog icons: - src: /images/icon-192x192.png sizes: 192x192 type: image/png - src: /images/icon-512x512.png sizes: 512x512 type: image/png start_url: /index.html theme_color: &#x27;#025ab1&#x27; background_color: &#x27;#dddddd&#x27; display: standalone Sitemap FileTo help Google and others a bit to index your blog, it is advisable to provide a sitemap file. Here comes Hexo Generator Sitemap to the rescue. Install it by running the command npm install hexo-generator-sitemap --save. You can configure it via _config.yml: 123sitemap: path: sitemap.xml template: ./sitemap-template.xml The plugin installation doesn’t create the needed sitemap-template file, so be sure you grab a copy from the plugins repository: https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap/blob/master/sitemap.xml CommentingHexo doesn’t have a commenting system, but it’s prepared to stick Disqus comments under each article. Just create a new Disqus account for your blog and note the given short name. By adding following section to the _config.yml Hexo shows the commenting section: 12disqus_enabled: truedisqus_shortname: my-blog Inifinite ScrollHexo shows as much articles at the start page as configured in _config.yml under index_generator.per_page, but it’s nicer to load more articles as you scroll by using the Hexo script Inifinite Scroll. Install by adding following little script in themes &amp; gt; layout &gt; _partial &gt; after-footer.ejs 12345678&lt;script src=&quot;//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/frontendsophie/hexo-infinite-scroll@2.0.0/dist/main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; infiniteScroll(&#123; showNum: 5, style: &#x27;line-scale&#x27;, color: &#x27;#025ab1&#x27; &#125;)&lt;/script&gt; Back To TopIts nice to support the reader on scolling by providing a Scroll-To-Top button. The easiest way to get this, is the script Vanilla Back To Top. Just add follwing to themes &gt;layout &gt; _partial &gt; after-footer.ejs: 123456789101112131415&lt;script&gt;addBackToTop(&#123; diameter: 30, backgroundColor: &#x27;rgb(0, 90, 180)&#x27;, textColor: &#x27;#fff&#x27;&#125;)&lt;/script&gt;&lt;style&gt;#back-to-top &#123; border-radius: 0; opacity: 0.6;&#125;#back-to-top:hover &#123; opacity: 1;&#125;&lt;/style&gt;","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"VS Code","slug":"VS-Code","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/VS-Code/"},{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"Blogging","slug":"Blogging","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Blogging/"}]},{"title":"A New Blog: VS Code, Hexo and GitHub Pages","subtitle":"Part One of having fun with Hexo and GitHub Pages","series":"A New Blog","date":"2019-09-23","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","excerpt":"A few days ago I puzzled over a technical problem regarding SQL Server, Active Directory and Visual Studio Database Projects.

Installation.. is quite easy, as described here: https://hexo.io/docs/setup Create folder and open in VS Code Open VS Code Terminal window Install Hexo with $ npm install -g hexo-cli Init Hexo project with $ hexo init Install dependencies with npm install Done WritingCreate new post&#x2F;draftHexo has posts and drafts, whereat drafts has to published via a Hexo command to become a post. To create an article use the command hexo new post|draft &quot;My Title&quot;. The title will be converted in a URL-encoded string and will be used as file name and url. Meta dataEvery post&#x2F;draft starts with its header (so called Front Matter) to store some meta data, which describes the post, like title, date, tags or categories. This is used by Hexo to classify and arrange your post during the build. MarkdownHexo posts&#x2F;drafts are written in Markdown. Good syntax reference are the Markdown Guide and the more detailed Markdown Syntax Guide. ExcerptIs is usual to show a short excerpt an the start page of a blog, to keep it compact and teasering the user to click on a READ MORE button. To achieve this, you just have to add following comment to your article. Everything above is the excerpt and everything below is only shown, when you enter the article: &lt;!-- more --&gt; ImagesSome articles will contain images to illustrate something and the question is, where should they be stored? Answer: In a folder beside the post&#x2F;draft, which has the same name as the article MD file. To get this, you have to activate the setting post_asset_folder in your _config.yml. Now this folder will be created automatically, when you add a new post&#x2F;draft. In your Markdown you reference your image with: &#123;% asset_img image-1.png \"Test Image\" %&#125; BuildHexo is a website generator, so a build will generate the whole website in a special folder, which has to be published. This output folder can be configured in the _config.yml: public_dir: public To wipe the output folder, run the command: hexo clean To start the build, run: hexo generate To view the website via the build-in local Hexo server, run: hexo server PublishingMost “complex” task was to publish the new blog on GitHub Pages. My first approach was to use my personal page, as I did with my single HTML file, but this didn’t work, because I wanted to store the whole project on GitHub and it is not possible to point a personal page to the subdirectory docs or use a different branch as master. The simple solution was to create a new repository, named after my my blog kiko.io, to store teh whole project and point the GitHub Page to the subdirectory docs in the settings of the repository. By overriding the default publish folder of Hexo in _config.yml … public_dir: docs … everything was set up. Commit and Push via git and done. Hexo has its own deploying mechanism and it is advisable to disable it, by commenting out the Deployment section _config.yml. Next step was to use my own custom domain for the blog. To achieve this, the most easiest way is to create a text file named CNAME (without extension!) with the content of the domain in a single line and publish this file in the root of the docs folder. Github will recognize this file and do the setup automatically. To point the domain to GitHub, I had to create following A records in my domain providers DNS settings: 185.199.108.153 185.199.109.153 185.199.110.153 185.199.111.153 Last step was to enable Enforce HTTPS in the repositories settings.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"VS Code","slug":"VS-Code","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/VS-Code/"},{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"GitHub","slug":"GitHub","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/GitHub/"},{"name":"Blogging","slug":"Blogging","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Blogging/"}]},{"title":"How-To: Visual Studio Database Project and ADSI","subtitle":null,"date":"2019-09-17","updated":"2022-12-22","path":"post/How-To-Visual-Studio-Database-Project-and-ADSI/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/How-To-Visual-Studio-Database-Project-and-ADSI/","excerpt":"If you are working with a Visual Studio Database Project and have to deal with data from the Active Directory via a Linked Server, you have to announce the data structure of the AD data in order to get the project compiled.","keywords":"working visual studio database project deal data active directory linked server announce structure ad order compiled","text":"If you are working with a Visual Studio Database Project and have to deal with data from the Active Directory via a Linked Server, you have to announce the data structure of the AD data in order to get the project compiled. Step 1 - Linking to the Active DirectoryFirst of all you have to connect your SQL Server to the AD permanently, by running following SQL script once on your SQL Server: USE [master] GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedserver @server = N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @srvproduct=N&#39;Active Directory Service Interfaces&#39;, @provider=N&#39;ADSDSOObject&#39;, @datasrc=N&#39;adsdatasource&#39; EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedsrvlogin @rmtsrvname=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @useself=N&#39;False&#39;, @locallogin=NULL, @rmtuser=N&#39;mydomain\\myadminuser&#39;, @rmtpassword=&#39;mypassword&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;collation compatible&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;data access&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;true&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;dist&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;pub&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;rpc&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;rpc out&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;sub&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;connect timeout&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;0&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;collation name&#39;, @optvalue=null GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;lazy schema validation&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;query timeout&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;0&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;use remote collation&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;true&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;remote proc transaction promotion&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;true&#39; GO Step 2 - Fetching ADSI dataTo get data, use OpenQuery against the Linked Server. In order to get only persons and no system accounts, you should filter out all users, which has no firstname (givenName) or lastname (sn): SELECT UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName], sn AS [LastName], givenName AS [FirstName], title AS [Title], Mail as [MailAddress], department AS [Department], l AS [Location], postalCode AS [PostCode], streetAddress AS [Street], st AS [State] FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, &#39; SELECT UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, sAMAccountName, sn, givenName, department, title, Mail, l, postalCode, streetAddress, st FROM &#39;&#39;LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de&#39;&#39; WHERE objectClass = &#39;&#39;User&#39;&#39; AND objectCategory = &#39;&#39;Person&#39;&#39; AND sn=&#39;&#39;*&#39;&#39; AND givenName = &#39;&#39;*&#39;&#39; &#39;) In most cases you’re done with that … except your organisation has more the 900 users! Then you have to split the fetch in several requests, because SQL Server quits with an error, when trying to read more than 900 records via ADSI. Best option is, to filter the ADSI statement by something like ‘get all user starting with a to j’, when you are sure, that in this case less than 900 records will be given back and repeat the statement several times and glue the data together via a UNION statement: SELECT UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName], sn AS [LastName], givenName AS [FirstName], title AS [Title], Mail as [MailAddress], department AS [Department], l AS [Location], postalCode AS [PostCode], streetAddress AS [Street], st AS [State] FROM ( SELECT * FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, ' SELECT UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, sAMAccountName, sn, givenName, department, title, Mail, l, postalCode, streetAddress, st FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' WHERE objectClass = ''User'' AND objectCategory = ''Person'' AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*'' AND sAMAccountName &lt;= ''j'' ') UNION ALL SELECT * FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, ' SELECT [...same as above] FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' WHERE objectClass = ''User'' AND objectCategory = ''Person'' AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*'' AND sAMAccountName &gt; ''j'' AND sAMAccountName &lt; ''p'' ') UNION ALL SELECT * FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, ' SELECT [...same as above] FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' WHERE objectClass = ''User'' AND objectCategory = ''Person'' AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*'' AND sAMAccountName &gt;= ''p'' ') ) AD When you store this as a VIEW, you can join it wherever you want on SQL Server: CREATE VIEW [dbo].[vADUsers] AS [...SQL code from above] GO Step 3 - SQL Server Database ProjectIf you work with a SQL Server Database Project, to have the complete structure of your database available in a version control system, you will get some reference errors on compiling and publishing your newly added SQL View vADUsers and on some objects, which rely on this View, because of following problems: Project doesn’t know the Linked Server ADSI The structure (fields) of the data source is unknown Declare the Linked ServerTo show the Project that there is a Linked Server called ADSI, just add following lines at the start of your view: sp_addlinkedserver 'ADSI' GO CREATE VIEW [dbo].[vADUsers] AS [...SQL code from above] This mimics the adding of a Linked Server, but will be ignored by SQL Server on publish, because you already have a Linked Server with this name. The project is happy with it. Declare the data structureWhen you use the SQL-View vADUsers in a Stored Procedure for example, this object won’t compile, because the project knows nothing about the fields of the ADSI data source. The SELECT in the view is not enough. You have to add an empty SELECT to the View vADUsers, just for the declaration of the fields and without returning any records and join this via UNION with the other statements: sp_addlinkedserver 'ADSI' GO CREATE VIEW [dbo].[vtADAllUsers] AS SELECT UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName], sn AS [LastName], givenName AS [FirstName], title AS [Title], Mail as [MailAddress], department AS [Department], l AS [Location], postalCode AS [PostCode], streetAddress AS [Street], st AS [State] FROM ( -- Fake SELECT to declare the structure of the view SELECT TOP 0 '' UserPrincipalName, '' DisplayName, '' sAMAccountName, '' sn, '' givenName, '' department, '' title, '' Mail, '' l, '' postalCode, '' streetAddress, '' st UNION ALL SELECT * FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, ' SELECT UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, sAMAccountName, sn, givenName, department, title, Mail, l, postalCode, streetAddress, st FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' WHERE objectClass = ''User'' AND objectCategory = ''Person'' AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*'' AND sAMAccountName &gt;= ''j'' ') UNION ALL SELECT * FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, ' SELECT [...same as above] FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' WHERE objectClass = ''User'' AND objectCategory = ''Person'' AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*'' AND sAMAccountName &lt; ''j'' AND sAMAccountName &gt; ''p'' ') UNION ALL SELECT * FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, ' SELECT [...same as above] FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' WHERE objectClass = ''User'' AND objectCategory = ''Person'' AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*'' AND sAMAccountName &lt;= ''p'' ') ) AD Now, you can fetch data from Active Directory and store the code in a Database Project properly.
