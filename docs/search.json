[{"title":"Open Source Insights - Seeing the big picture","url":"/post/Open-Source-Insights-Seeing-the-big-picture/","content":"\nA while ago I needed some functionality regarding database access in one of my spare time projects and I decided to use a library from NPM. Typed ``npm install`` and the hell was breaking loose ... 186 direct dependencies and nearly 200K of files were flooding my harddrive!\n\nThe mental basis of IT is lazyness, which means that we produce software to make our and others life easier. This also applies to the building process. Don't reinvent the wheel, but reuse the work of other developers. But ... we have to recognize the limits and prevent to fall into the dependency hell.\n\nTo get a better overview over dependencies, regarding NPM and other repositories, some Google engineers have published a project called **[Open Source Insights](https://deps.dev/)** a couple of days ago.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n![Open Source Insights - Overview](Open-Source-Insights-Seeing-the-big-picture/overview.png)\n\nIf you look at a library on NPM, you immediately see the direct dependencies, but that could just be the tip of the iceberg. Insights shows you the big picture in form of an interactive graph or a complete list with many additional information of the complete dependency chain.\n\n![Open Source Insights - Overview](Open-Source-Insights-Seeing-the-big-picture/graph.png)\n\nAs Google says:\n\n> Your software and your users rely not only on the code you write, but also on the code your code depends on, the code that code depends on, and so on. An accurate view of the complete dependency graph is critical to understanding the state of your project.\n\nNext time, before you type ``npm install ...`` take a quick look at the Insights page of the library, because it won't give you an overview over the dependecies only, but also some security advisories to let you decide if it is a good idea to use it.\n\nVery valueable for the authors of exisiting NPM projects also, because it shows the consequences of dependency decisions very clearly and gives hints to make the own library less sensitive to vulnerabilities.\n\nLet us hope, that Google removes the describing adjective *experimental* from the project some day and adds more and more functionality to it (like a working responsiveness ;) in order to establish **Open Source Insights** as a main source of information about reusable Open Source software.\n","tags":["Great Finds"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Discoveries #10","url":"/post/Discoveries-10/","content":"\n{% anchorlist \n  \"Beyond Console.log()|beyond-console-log\"\n  \"DOMGuard - Stop scammers from the manipulating DOM|dom-guard\"\n  \"Handling User Permissions in JavaScript|handling-permissions-in-js\"\n  \"html-chain - Make html by chaining javascript functions|html-chain\"\n  \"Accessible Autocomplete|accessible-autocomplete\"\n  \"JS DataTable|js-datatable\"\n  \"MK Charts|mk-charts\"\n  \"Snabbt.js - Fast animations with Javascript and CSS transforms|snabbt-js\"\n  \"SimplyLazy - Pure JavaScript Image Lazy Loader|simply-lazy\",\n  \"Blury-Loading|blury-loading\"\n%}\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nTodays Discoveries it's all about my favourite programming langugae JavaScript.

Don't miss Part 2 {% post_link 2021/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Sending-Webmentions \"Hexo and the IndieWeb (Sending Webmentions)\" %} either.\n{% endalertbox %}\n\n---\n\nA meaningful interaction has always two directions: sending and receiving. In this part of the post I want to show you how to receive Webmentions from other blogs participating in the IndieWeb.\n\nAs Hexo is a SSG it generates static HTML pages. This has the advantage that the pages can be hosted just about anywhere (in my case [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but also the disadvantage of not having a real backend. Therefore, we need an external service that acts as an Webmention endpoint, where other people can send their webmentions.\n\n[Aaron Parecki](https://aaronparecki.com/), co-founder of the IndieWeb, has made a service called [**webmention.io**](https://webmention.io/) we can use for free. It is able to convert old-fashioned Pingbacks to Webmentions, supports deleting of unwanted mentions, has a Blocklist for blocking domains, Webhooks for real-time processing and last but not least an API to get all your Webmentions per page or per site.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Setup\n\nwebmention.io needs a registration and Aaron uses his own authentication method **Web Sign-In** over [IndieLogin](https://indielogin.com/) to achieve that.\n\n{% asset_img indielogin.png %}\n\nAfter you have signed in, you see your settings with two important links, you have to integrate in the head of your HTML:\n\n```html\n  <link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://webmention.io/[YOUR-BLOG-DOMAIN]/webmention\" />\n  <link rel=\"pingback\" href=\"https://webmention.io/[YOUR-BLOG-DOMAIN]/xmlrpc\" />\n```\n\nThey define your page on the one hand as a webmention- and on the other hand as a pingback endpoint. Every send Webmention or Pingback from another blog is routed to these URL's.\n\nYou will also find your **API Key** on this page. To be honest, is not a real API key, but rather a key to retrieve all incoming webmentions at once. Therefore it does not need to be kept private and secured. There is no way to modify your incoming Webmentions over it.\n\n## Incoming Webmentions\n\n{% alertbox info %}\nI'm implementing my Hexo/Webmention solution as I'm writing this post, therefore I don't have any Webmentions to show as an example. Since all mentions on webmention.io are publicly accessible, I simply use Max Böcks article [Using Webmentions in Eleventy](https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/) in the following. Max, I hope it is ok ... :)\n{% endalertbox %}\n\nAaron has defined three ways to get the incoming mentions of a particular article on your blog:\n\n### 1. View as HTML page\n\n{% pre_highlight %}\nhttps://webmention.io/api/<b>mentions.html</b>?target=<i>https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/</i>\n{% endpre_highlight %}\n\n{% asset_img view-html.png %}\n\nUsing it this way, webmention.io integrates the content with some styles and other information of the sending post for easy reading.\n<br>\n\n### 2. Consume as Atom feed\n\n{% pre_highlight %}\nhttps://webmention.io/api/<b>mentions.atom</b>?target=<i>https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/</i>\n{% endpre_highlight %}\n\n{% asset_img view-atom.png %}\n<br>\n\n### 3. Get as JSON\n\n{% pre_highlight %}\nhttps://webmention.io/api/<b>mentions.jf2</b>?target=<i>https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/</i>\n{% endpre_highlight %}\n\n{% asset_img view-json.png %}\n<br>\n\nEspecially the last one is interesting for us, because we can use it to automate getting the data and integrate it in our blog post.\n\nYou can also use all these Url's to get the Webmentions of all of your pages, by changing the ``target`` parameter into:\n\n{% pre_highlight %}\n...?<b>token</b>=[YOUR-API-KEY]\n{% endpre_highlight %}\n\nThe feed with token for getting all webmentions is particularly practical for checking whether there are new ones for your blog via a feed reader.\n\nThere are some parameters you have to be aware of:\n\n| Parameter | Example |\n| -------- | ------- |\n| Paging | ``?per-page=20&page=0`` (**default**, page 1 with 20 entries) |\n| Sorting By | ``?sort-by=created`` (**default**) |\n| Sorting Direction | ``?sort-dir=down`` (**default**, newest first) |\n| Time Limit | ``?since=2021-05-10T12:00:00-0700`` |\n| ID Limit | ``?since_id=500``).\n\nYou can find more on parameters in the documentation of webmention.io's source code here: [https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io](https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io).\n\n## The Data\n\nLet's dive into the data. The JSON is a list and every Webmention is an entry underneath ``children``, with following useful fields:\n\n| Field | Purpose |\n| ---- | ------- |\n|``author.name``|Name of the sender|\n|``author.photo``|Avatar photo of the sender|\n|``author.url``|Personal URL of the sender|\n|``wm-id``|Unique ID of the Webmention|\n|``wm-target``|URL of your post|\n|``wm-received``|UTC Date/Time sended|\n|``wm-source``|URL of the sending post |\n|``published``|Publish Date/Time of the sending post|\n|``wm-property``|Webmention type out of the following values:<ul><li><b>mention-of</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Mention as link in post</li><li><b>in-reply-to</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Reply to your post</li><li><b>like-of</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Like of your post</li><li><b>repost-of</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Repost of your post</li><li><b>bookmark-of</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Bookmark of your post</li></ul>|\n\nOther occuring fields are optional, but no less interesting for displaying them at your post:\n\n| Field | Purpose |\n| ---- | ------- |\n|``name``|Name of the Webmention (title of the sending post or something)|\n|``summary.type``|Summary type of the Webmention, e.g. \"text/plain\"|\n|``summary.value``|Summary text of the Webmention|\n|``content.html``|Content as HTML of sending post|\n|``content.text``|Content as text of sending post|\n\nThe fact that we get the complete HTML content of the sending post, means that we easily can parse it for IndieWeb microformats (see {% post_link 2021/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb \"Part 1\" %}) to get even more information about it and the blog owner!\n\n---\n\n## Integration\n\nWe have two ways to choose from in order to integrate the data thus obtained into the post:\n\n1. Static ... means while generating the site\n2. Dynamic ... means real-time via client-side Javascript\n\nThe static approach has two big disadvantages:\n\n- The Webmentions are only visible with a time delay, due to the need of generating the pages of the site\n- Hexos generation mechanism only takes those, whose content has beed updated in the meanwhile, but do not take into account any external data like Webmentions. We would have to fire up the time consuming ``clean`` and ``generate`` all the time\n\nSo, let's go for the dynamic approach, a little bit JavaScript, which loads the Webmentions on page load (like most Commenting platforms do).\n\nFirst of all, we need a placeholder in our article.ejs, where the Webmentions will be displayed. Somewhere near the comments and implemented as another partial:\n\n```html layout/_partial/article.ejs\n\n<article id=\"<%= post.layout %>-<%= post.slug %>\" \n         class=\"article article-type-<%= post.layout %> h-entry\" itemscope itemprop=\"blogPost\">\n\n  ...\n\n  <%- partial('post/webmentions') %>\n\n  <%- partial('post/comments') %>\n  <%- partial('post/related') %>\n  <%- partial('post/nav') %>\n\n</article>\n```\n\n```html layout/_partial/post/webmentions.ejs\n<div class=\"article-webmentions\">\n\n  <div class=\"webmentions-placeholder\">\n    <p class=\"wm-placeholder\">No Webmentions yet...</p>\n  </div>\n  \n  <script>\n    window.addEventListener('load', function () {\n      insertWebmentions('<%- post.slug.toLowerCase() %>');\n    })    \n  </script>\n\n</div>\n```\n\nThe call ``insertWebmentions`` references to the asset script ``webmentions.js``, which will be bundled via Grunt in my case, but you can place it where you want and add it to your articles head element. The main thing is, that it will load when the article page is launched.\n\nThe script checks, if the user has already loaded the Webmentions for the current page from webmention.io in the last hour and do so if not, and stores the data in the browser by the pages key (slug) and with a timestamp:\n\n```js assets/webmentions.js\nfunction insertWebmentions(key) {\n  const lsTimestamp = \"wmts_\" + key;\n  const lsWebmentions = \"wm_\" + key;\n\n  const currentUrl = window.location.href;\n  const wmUrl = `https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?target=${currentUrl}&per-page=1000&sort-dir=up`;\n\n  let lastRequest;\n  let webmentions;\n\n  // Get data from browser storage, if available\n  if (localStorage.getItem(lsTimestamp) && \n    localStorage.getItem(lsWebmentions)) {\n\n    lastRequest = localStorage.getItem(lsTimestamp);\n    webmentions = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(lsWebmentions));\n  }\n\n  if(webmentions && lastRequest && Math.abs(Date.now() - lastRequest) / (60*60*1000) < 1) {\n    // Webmentions are present and not older than an hour\n    process();\n  } else {\n    // Get Webmentions from webmention.io\n    load().then(() => { process(); });\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * Load webmention.io's JSON data for the current page\n   */\n  async function load() {\n    const response = await fetch(wmUrl);\n    webmentions = await response.json();\n    localStorage.setItem(lsWebmentions, JSON.stringify(webmentions));\n    localStorage.setItem(lsTimestamp, Date.now());\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Process Webmentions\n   */\n  function process() {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nActually the script loads the first 1000 Webmentions in ascending order of their retreiving date. Should last for a while or I may feel like adding real paging at some point ;)\n\nOn processing the webmentions, a separate HTML block is generated for each type (``wm-property``) regarding the content of the Webmention, whereby the header is always the same. The ``VERB`` refers to the Webmentions type: *mentioned*, *replied*, *liked*, *bookmarked* or *reposted*.\n\n```html HEADER\n<div class=\"wm-card h_card\">\n  <a class=\"wm-photo-link u-url\" href=\"[AUTHOR.URL]\">\n    <img class=\"wm-photo u-photo\" width=\"44\" height=\"44\" \n          src=\"[AUTHOR.PHOTO]\" alt=\"[AUTHOR.NAME]\">\n  </a>\n  <div class=\"wm-meta\">\n    <a class=\"wm-name p-name\" href=\"[AUTHOR.URL]\">[AUTHOR.NAME]</a>\n    <span class=\"wm-verb\">[VERB] on</span>\n    <time class=\"wm-date dt-published\" datetime=\"[WM-RECEIVED]\">\n      [formatted WM-RECEIVED]\n    </time>\n    <small>[Running Number]</small>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe HTML of the five implemented types:\n\n```html MENTION\n<div class=\"webmention wm-mentioned\" id=\"[WM-ID]\">\n  [HEADER HTML]\n  <div class=\"wm-content p-content\">\n    <p>[First 50 words of CONTENT.TEXT with ellipsis]</p>\n    <a class=\"wm-source\" href=\"[WM-SOURCE]\">[WM-SOURCE]</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```html REPLY\n<div class=\"webmention wm-mentioned\" id=\"[WM-ID]\">\n  [HEADER HTML]\n  <div class=\"wm-content p-content\">\n    <p>[Complete CONTENT.HTML]</p>\n    <a class=\"wm-source\" href=\"[WM-SOURCE]\">[WM-SOURCE]</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```html LIKE & BOOKMARK (no content)\n<div class=\"webmention wm-mentioned\" id=\"[WM-ID]\">\n  [HEADER HTML]\n</div>\n```\n\n```html REPOST\n<div class=\"webmention wm-mentioned\" id=\"[WM-ID]\">\n  [HEADER HTML]\n  <div class=\"wm-content p-content\">\n    <p>\n      ... at <a href=\"[WM-SOURCE]\">[WM-SOURCE]</a>\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe result will look like this, after adding some styles:\n\n{% asset_img wm-example.png %}\n\nYou can download the complete JavaScript- and the Stylus file on Github:  \n[**https://github.com/kristofzerbe/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Files**](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Files)\n\n---\n\n### Form for sending Webmentions manually\n\nAs you may noticed in {% post_link 2021/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Sending-Webmentions \"Part 2\" %}, some manual work is necessary to have webmentions sent. Therefore, it is good to give the user a possibility to submit his blog post, where he mentions yours, directly. As webmentions.io supports posting a new source, the HTML form is quite simple an we can integrate it in the partial from above, below the script tag:\n\n```html layout/_partial/post/webmentions.ejs\n<div class=\"article-webmentions\">\n\n  ...\n\n  <form class=\"webmention-form\" \n        action=\"https://webmention.io/<%- config.title %>>/webmention\" \n        name=\"webmention-form\" method=\"post\">\n    \n    <label for=\"webmention-form-source\">Your Article URL:</label><br>\n    <input class=\"webmention-form-source\" \n          type=\"url\" name=\"source\" \n          placeholder=\"https://your-blog.com/your-article\" required=\"\">\n    \n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"target\" value=\"<%- post.permalink %>>\">\n    \n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send Webmention\">\n  \n  </form>\n\n</div>\n```\n\nThe variable ``config.title`` defines the name of your blog with which you have registered at webmention.io. In the hidden input, we use the permalink of the current page/article as the mentions target.\n\n---\n\n## Building Bridges\n\nYes, the IndieWeb and Webmentions are an alternative concept of social networking, bypassing the big silos like Facebook, Twitter and Co. ... but they exist and they have a massive reach. Of course, your posts will be shared there, so why not include those mentions?\n\n[**Bridgy**](https://brid.gy/) is such a bridge builder. It connects your blog with the big social media players:\n\n{% asset_img bridgy.png %}\n\nThe only thing you have to do, is to allow Bridgy to access your social media data, like your Tweets on Twitter. If somebody mentions you and one of your articles as a Tweet, Reply or Like, it sends a mention to the endpoint defined in your HTML, in our case webmention.io. Thats it ... kinda magic.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nSome people say, Webmentions makes commenting forms on blogs, like Disqus or others, obsolete, but I don't agree with that, because not every visitor owns a blog and not every blog owner want's to write a post only to comment the thoughts of another blogger. Both approaches work well side by side and complement each other. Webmentions are super to build a blog network and  increasing your blogs coverage.

But what makes Facebook, Twitter and others \"social\" is the interaction between the people. Likes, Retweets, Mentions, Replies are the fuel which drives them. But most of the blogging solutions offers only rudimentary interactions, in form of article comments. The comment hurdle is high because interacting on someone else's site is different from interacting on what is supposed to be your own, such as your Twitter or Facebook feed.\n\nThe project [**IndieWeb**](https://indieweb.org/) and their approach of [**Webmentions**](https://indieweb.org/Webmention), has the goal to fill this gap. As a [W3C recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/), it defines standards how the social interaction of independent blogging solutions can be technically implemented without the need of manual intervention. Let software do the job...\n\nIn this article I will only briefly go into the basics and then show an implementation solution for the SSG [**Hexo**](https://hexo.io).\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n---\n\n## Basic Concepts\n\nNothing describes the flow of Webmentions better than this:\n\n{% blockquote_alt \"Drew McLellan\" \"https://allinthehead.com/retro/378/implementing-webmentions\" %}\n1. Frankie posts a blog entry.\n2. Alex has thoughts in response, so also posts a blog entry linking to Frankie’s.\n3. Alex’s publishing software finds the link and fetches Frankie’s post, finding the URL of Frankie’s Webmention endpoint in the document.\n4. Alex’s software sends a notification to the endpoint.\n5. Frankie’s software then fetches Alex’s post to verify that it really does link back, and then chooses how to display the reaction alongside Frankie’s post.\n{% endblockquote_alt %}\n\nBasically Webmentions allow notifications between **web addresses**, therefore every post, which is part of the interaction, has to have a unique [permalink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink).\n\nA blog software that wants to support webmentions must cover 4 main points:\n\n1. The HTML has to tell others who you are\n2. The HTML has to give dedicated informations about your posts\n3. Sending a message to another blog, in case you mentioned one of its posts\n4. Reveiving messages from other blogs, in case they mentioned one of your posts\n\nPoint 4 is probably the most interesting for all of us, because it pats our own ego on the back, since we usually don't write for ourselves, but for others, and reactions to it, show us that it wasn't pointless.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: The Personal & Profile HTML\n\nAs you want to interact with other blogs participating in the IndieWeb with your posts, they have to know something about you and your articles in a machine-readable form.\n\n### Personal Information\n\nHTML is machine-readable per se, but you have to tell others what to look for by adding defined classes to the tags which holds the information, in order to enable them to get specific information about you, like your name, your mail-address or links to other profiles f.e. Github, Twitter and so on.\n\nIt is necessary to have this information not only in an ABOUT page, but also on each post page. You can achieve this either by having an ABOUT block like here on kiko.io or providing the information in hidden HTML tags elsewhere in your HTML.\n\nIt does not matter which tags you use, you only have to add the defined class to the tag of a particular information in your Hexo EJS file. The information will be extracted out of the tag's inner text.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nThe most used classes for personal blogs as follows:\n\n|Class|Information|\n|---|---|\n|[**h-card**](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card)|Wrapper for all personal information.<br> *All other classes below has to be used on child tags*|\n|**p-name**|Full name|\n|**u-email**|Email address|\n|**u-photo**|Photo|\n|**p-role**|Role|\n|**u-url**|URL representing the person|\n|**p-locality**|City or Town|\n|**p-region**|State or province|\n|**p-country-name**|Country name|\n\n{% alertbox exclamation %}\nPlease keep in mind not to give too much information about you to the public. It could get unpleasant...\n{% endalertbox %}\n\n### Profile Information\n\nFor providing links to other profiles, anchor (``A``) tags with the special attribute [``rel=\"me\"``](http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me) will be used, which indicates profile equivalence and can be used for [identity-consolidation](http://microformats.org/wiki/identity-consolidation).\n\nWith this extension of your blog HTML, you are able to sign in using your domain at sites which supports **Web Sign-In** over the concept of **RelMeAuth**, for example those who use [**IndieAuth.net - OAuth for the open web**](https://indieauth.net/). You only have to make sure, that the endpoints of your profile links have **backlinks to your blog** with a ``rel=\"me``\". Unfortunately, not many services offer the definition of such a backlink. Github, for example, is an exception. You can give it a try at [IndieAuth.com](https://indieauth.com/).\n\n#### Example\n\n{% asset_img about-markup.png %}\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: The Article HTML\n\nTagging articles with meta information for the IndieWeb is similarly simple, by adding following classes in your article.ejs file:\n\n|Class|Information|\n|---|---|\n|[**h-entry**](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry)|Wrapper for all article related information|\n|**p-name**|Title|\n|**p-summary**|Short summary|\n|**e-content**|Content| \n|**dt-published**|Publish date|\n|**dt-updated**|Update date|\n|**u-url**|Permalink|\n\nIn case you work with the default Hexo theme 'landscape', I advise you to split your ``article.ejs`` in two files, because it is used for the article itself and for the excerpts on the start page and archive pages also. I have made an ``excerpt.ejs`` with all the information needed for listing the posts and cut back my ``article.ejs`` to the bare minimum, but with the IndieWeb related classes above (or in the linked partials if necessary), because only the article page itself should have these informations, respectively an ``h-entry`` class, to indicate that there are IndieWeb data!\n\n```html layout/_partial/article.ejs\n\n<article id=\"<%= post.layout %>-<%= post.slug %>\" \n         class=\"article article-type-<%= post.layout %> h-entry\" itemscope itemprop=\"blogPost\">\n  \n  <div class=\"article-meta\">\n\n    <div class=\"h-card p-author\" style=\"display:none\">\n      <img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"<%- config.photo %>\" alt=\"<%- config.author %>\" />\n      <a class=\"p-name

%>\n\n</article>\n```\n\n### External Links\n\nThe Interaction with other blogs takes place through linking to those external sources in the content of your article.\n\nLets say you want to write about a specific topic and to mention the work of another developer, then you just place a link to his post in your Markdown, as you have been doing all along:\n\n```md /source/_posts/my-fancy-post.md\n# My Fancy Post\n...\nJack has done a wonderful job with his [Awesome Work](https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work)\n...\n```\n\nIt will be transformed while generating into something like that:\n\n```html /output/.../my-fancy-post/index.html\n<body>\n  ...\n  <article class=\"h-entry\">\n    ...\n    <div class=\"article-inner\">\n      <header class=\"article-header\">\n        <h1 class=\"p-name\">My Fancy Post</h1>\n      </header>\n      <div class=\"article-entry e-content\">\n        ...\n        <p>\n          Jack has done a wonderful job with his <a href=\"https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work\">Awesome Work</a>.\n        </p>\n        ...\n      </div>\n      ...\n    </div>\n    ...\n  </article>\n  ...\n</body>\n```\n\nIn the terms of the IndieWeb concept, your post will a be an [article](https://indieweb.org/article), which mentions other posts, as the old-fashioned pingbacks do.\n\n---\n\n## Special Post Formats\n\nA true interaction takes place, when you are posting in a certain syndication context ... with a [note](https://indieweb.org/note) as a [response](https://indieweb.org/responses) to the work of others, mainly by adding additional classes to the external link:\n\n* [u-in-reply-to](https://indieweb.org/reply) ... to indicate that your post is a **reply** to a post as part of a conversation\n* [u-like-of](https://indieweb.org/like) ... to indicate that your post is a **like**\n* [u-repost-of](https://indieweb.org/repost) ... to indicate that your post is a **repost** (100% re-publication)\n* [u-bookmark-of](https://indieweb.org/bookmark) ... to indicate that your post is a **bookmark**\n\nEvery response type can have additional information about your post and the syndication of it.\n\n### Example REPLY\n\n```html\n<body>\n  ...\n  <div class=\"h-entry\">\n    <p>\n      In reply to: <a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work\">Jacks Blog: Awesome Work</a>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"p-name e-content\">\n      Jack, you have done a wonderful job!\n    </p>\n    ...\n  </div>\n  ...\n</body>\n```\n\n### Example LIKE\n\n```html\n<body>\n  ...\n  <div class=\"h-entry\">\n    <p class=\"p-summary\">\n      Kristof liked <a class=\"u-like-of\" href=\"https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work\">Jacks Awesome Work at https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work</a>\n    </p>\n    ...\n  </div>\n  ...\n</body>\n```\n\n{% alertbox exclamation %}\nCurrently, I would not recommend writing responses as a normal post in Hexo, as it is based on structured text, that best describes the IndieWeb concept of an ARTICLE.<br>**As this post is part of a new series

To group these articles I considered using the build-in ``categories``, but I already used them to group articles by the underlying tech stack or area, like ´JavaScript´, ´C#´ or ´Tools´ and I didn't want to mix it, as the category was also used in the Url of a post.\n\nI was researching another grouping solution for Hexo and stumbled upon [hexo-index-anything](https://github.com/leviwheatcroft/hexo-index-anything), a very clever Hexo plugin to generate index pages for almost every [FrontMatter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter.html) variable in a post.\n\nAs it was freely available under a MIT license on Github, I forked it in July 2020 and made some bug fixes and drop a pull request to Levi ... but he  unfortunately never answered my pull or issue requests and has set the status of the project to DEPRECATED.\n\nOk then ... make a successor on your own, fella...\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Basic Functionality\n\nLet me describe how the original plugin and my successor are working in general:\n\nAssume, you have several posts from different authors and you want a list of all posts for every author. The only thing you have to do (after installation and configuration of the plugin), is to add a custom variable called ``author`` to the FrontMatter of each post, with the name of the author as value.\n\n```yml /source/_posts/my-fancy-post.md\ntitle: My Fancy Post\ndate: 2021-04-25 13:41:46\nauthor: Kristof\n...\n```\n\nNext time you run ``hexo generate``, several new files will be available in your output folder:\n\n**One INDEX page**\n\n... for the **author index**, with a list of all available authors and the number of the posts:\n* /authors/index.html\n\n**Many POSTS pages**\n\n..., one for each author for the **author index**, with all of the authors posts:\n\n* /authors/kristof/index.html\n* /authors/ ... /index.html\n\n## New Plugin Name\n\nIn order to avoid confusion (and be able to provide the plugin on Github/NPM) I needed a new name for the plugin and due to the fact that it is a generator, I named it simply **hexo-generator-anything**.\n\n## New Features\n\nThe original code was really hard to read, because every second variable was named 'index', therefore I started with some refactorings, before I continued implementing new features.\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe original, one-dimensional variable to index mapping, wasn't meaningful enough for me. The new mapping is now a dictionary and has unique identifiers:\n\n```yml /_config.yml\nanything:\n  layout_index: anything-index\n  layout_posts: anything-posts\n  index_mappings:\n    - variable: author\n      path: authors\n```\n\nThe ``template*`` setting names has changed into ``layout_*``, to make more clear what they are meant for. They are pointing to an existing EJS file in your Hexo themes layout folder to render the particular page.\n\n* ``layout_index``   \nEJS file (without extension) to render the INDEX page\n\n* ``layout_Posts``   \nEJS file (without extension) to render each POSTS page\n\nOn [Github](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/hexo-generator-anything) and in the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-generator-anything) you will find sample EJS files and some partials, to take the SoC pattern into account.\n\nThe original ``titleSeparator`` setting is not longer available, because it is not necessary anymore. By providing a data structure for ``index`` with the attributes ``name`` and ``caption``, a title can be put together in the EJS file itself.\n\n### Introducing linked Markdown files\n\nOne of my needs was, to provide more information on the INDEX page and the POSTS pages for each entry or, to stay with the example, for each author. As the ``_posts`` folder is used for storing the post data files, I introduced a **``_anything``** folder for dropping MD files, which are linked to the index and its values.\n\n{% asset_img \"anything-folder.png\" %}\n\nThe subfolders of **``_anything``** are representing the index and the files in it each possible value of the index.\n\nThe file is structured like any other post file: the FrontMatter data at the top and below some content to show along with the the entry to describe it:\n\n```yml /source/_anything/authors/kristof.md\n---\ntitle: Kristof\ngithub: https://github.com/kristofzerbe\navatar: kristof.png\n---\n\n... some smart things to say about Kristof, or links or images, whatever ...\n```\n\nThe INDEX file itself may have its own Markdown file, to provide addition text or data to it, like describing the list.\n\nThe variable ``title`` is a requirement in the Markdown files, but you can add as many variables as you need and use it in the EJS files. All data will be passed through to the template.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe new plugin runs very well and it is heavy in use on generating the sections [Series](https://kiko.io/series) and [Projects](https://kiko.io/projects) of this blog.

From BMP files to GIF and JPG files, PNG files, to complete or customizable symbol fonts like [fontello.com](https://fontello.com), to Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).\n\nSVG's in particular are becoming increasingly popular, because they are nothing more than XML-like code, that can be manipulated via CSS or JS, their digital footprint is unbeatable small and they scale seemlessly.\n\nDealing with SVG's is a little bit more difficult than placing a PNG in HTML, because of its complexity, but it is worth learning as much as possible about it. So did I in the last couple of month and I want to share my finds on the web with you in this post.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Using SVG's in brief\n\nThe most useful way of using SVG's is as an image out of a file, either directly ...:\n\n<button><img src=\"options.svg\" /></button><br><em>(use DevTools [F12] to inspect the element)</em>\n\n```html\n<img src=\"images/options.svg\" />\n```\n\n... or as a background image:\n\n<style>\n  button.options {\n    height: 56px;\n    width: 56px;\n    background-image: url(options.svg);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-position: 50% 50%;\n  }\n</style>\n<button class=\"options\"></button><br><em>(use DevTools [F12] to inspect the element)</em>\n\n```html\n<style>\n  button.options {\n    height: 56px;\n    width: 56px;\n    background: url(images/options.svg);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-position: 50% 50%;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<button class=\"options\"></button>\n```\n\nAs files, no matter how small, has to be requested from the server, you can also define SVG's inline for better performance:\n\n<div>\n<button>\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n      width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24

It is absolutely fundamental to have a protection layer, which filters out unwanted data requests.  \n\nA common way is to limit the service access by providing API Keys to well known clients. In this post I will show you how to implement such a filter in terms of API keys and IP addresses. \n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## The Settings\n\nLets start with the list of clients, who should be able to access the data. The most useful place for this is in the **appsettings.json** of the Core 5.0 Web API project:\n\n```json appsettings.json\n...\n\n\"Callers\": [\n    {\n      \"Name\": \"localhost\",\n      \"ApiKey\": null,\n      \"IPAddress\": \"::1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"ApiKey\": \"mytopsecretapikeyforjohndoe\",\n      \"IPAddress\":  \"*\"\n    }\n  ]\n...\n```\n\nThis list has two entries: one for the server itself (\"localhost\"), which is restricted to the local IP address ``\"::1\"``, and one for the test user ``\"John Doe\"``, who can access from any IP address (``\"*\"``), but must supply his personal API key with his requests.\n\nIn order to handle this setting, we have to introduce it to the system at startup as a class:\n\n```c# CallerSetting.cs\n  public class CallerSetting\n  {\n      public string Name { get; set; }\n      public string ApiKey { get; set; }\n      public string IPAddress { get; set; }\n  }\n```\n\n```c# Startup.cs\n...\n\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) \n{\n  ...\n\n  IConfigurationSection configSection = Configuration.GetSection(\"Callers\");\n  services.Configure<List<CallerSetting>>(configSection);\n\n}\n...\n```\n\n## The Controller\n\nLet's assume we have a controller, which handles the API requests, like this:\n\n```c# MyFancyController.cs\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\n\nnamespace MyAPIProject\n{\n    [Route(\"api/helloworld\")]\n    [ApiController]\n    public class MyFancyAPIController : ControllerBase\n    {\n        [HttpGet]\n        public string Get()\n        {\n            return \"Hello World\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo prevent to write a request check against our new settings in each action method, we can decorate the whole controller class by introducing an new custom ``Attribute``, which will do the work:\n\n```c# MyFancyController.cs\n...\n\n[Route(\"api/helloworld\")]\n[ApiController]\n[AuthenticateApiRequest]\npublic class MyFancyAPIController : ControllerBase\n...\n```\n\n## The Attribute\nHere is the code for the new attribute. It uses the ``IActionFilter``. These filters run within the ASP.NET Core action invocation pipeline, in our case BEFORE the action is entered (``OnActionExecutionAsync``).\n\n```c# AuthenticateApiRequestAttribute.cs\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing System.Linq;\n\nnamespace MyAPIProject\n{\n  [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]\n  public class AuthenticateApiRequestAttribute : Attribute, IAsyncActionFilter\n  {\n    public async Task OnActionExecutionAsync\n    (\n      ActionExecutingContext context, \n      ActionExecutionDelegate next\n    )\n    {\n      // Get an Api Key from Request Header\n      context.HttpContext.Request.Headers.TryGetValue(\n        \"ApiKey\", out var requestApiKey\n      );\n\n      // Get the remote IP Address\n      var requestIpAddress = \n        context.HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress.ToString();\n\n      // Get access to 'appsettings.json'\n      var appSettings = \n        context.HttpContext.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<IConfiguration>();\n\n      // Get 'Callers' list from settings\n      var callers = appSettings.GetSection(\"Callers\")\n        .Get<List<CallerSetting>>();\n\n      // Get all Callers with matching IP Adress and/or API Key via LINQ\n      var current = callers.Where(c => \n        (c.IPAddress == requestIpAddress) || \n        (c.IPAddress == \"*\" && c.ApiKey == requestApiKey) ||\n        (c.IPAddress == requestIpAddress && c.ApiKey == requestApiKey));\n      \n      // Do we have a match?\n      if (current.Count() == 0)\n      {\n        // No, then return with an error \n        context.Result = new ContentResult()\n        {\n          StatusCode = 401,\n          Content = \"Unauthorized Access\"\n        };\n        return;\n      } \n\n      await next(); \n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## The Result\n\n![Test Request with Nightingale](Custom-Caller-Authentication-with-ASP-NET-Core-5-0-WebApi/api-request-nightingale.png)\n\n{% moreinfo '{ \"list\": [\n  [\n    \"Microsoft Docs\", \"Filters in ASP.NET Core\",\n    \"https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters?view=aspnetcore-5.0\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"Microsoft Docs\", \"Configuration in ASP.NET Core\",\n    \"https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-5.0\"\n  ]\n]}' %}","tags":["Visual Studio","WebAPI","Authentication"],"categories":["C#"]},{"title":"Discoveries #7","url":"/post/Discoveries-7/","content":"\nFebruary and the first sunny days in 2021.

In this article I want to show you my approach on this...\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nMy solution is based on a template system that I implemented into my project at an earlier stage. If you are interested in how this works, I recommend you read my article **[Utilize a repository of reusable ES6 template literals](https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/Utilize-a-repository-of-reusable-ES6-template-literals/)**.\n\nLet's start with the standard scaffold of an HTML5 app, extended with some ``style``'s, an initialization ``script`` and a lonely ``main`` element, we want to fill with some localized content:\n\n```html index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n        <meta http-equiv=\"language\" content=\"en\">\n\n        <title>Native JavaScript Multilanguage Templating</title>\n\n        <style>\n            body { padding: 2rem; }\n            main { text-align: center; }\n        </style>\n\n        <script type=\"module\">\n            import { App } from './app.js';\n            window.app = new App(); \n            app.init();\n        </script>\n\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n        <main></main>\n    </body>\n\n</html>\n```\n\nThe ``script`` points to the following ES6 module class in the file **app.js**:\n\n```js app.js\nclass App {\n\n  constructor() { \n    // do something when the class is instantiated\n  }\n\n  init() {\n    // do something to initialize the app\n  }\n}\nexport { App };\n```\n\nNothing uncommon so far, if you are familiar with [ES6 classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) and [imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)/[exports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export). \n\nNow let's create a **localizations.js** file, to store the needed localized strings in all wanted languages. Every language will have its own branch in a ``Localizations`` object, represented by its two-letter [ISO-639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). All translations are accessible via an unique english key word:\n\n```js localizations.js\nexport function Localizations() {\n    return {\n        \"EN\": {\n            \"helloWorld\": \"Hello World\"\n        },\n        \"DE\": {\n            \"helloWorld\": \"Hallo Welt\"\n        },\n        \"ES\": {\n            \"helloWorld\": \"Hola, mundo\"\n        },\n        \"FR\": {\n            \"helloWorld\": \"Bonjour le monde\"\n        },\n        \"RU\": {\n            \"helloWorld\": \"Здравствуйте, мир\"\n        },\n        \"JP\": {\n            \"helloWorld\": \"ハローワールド\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs we import the **localizations.js** in our **app.js**, we can initialize the localizations in the constructor of the app class with the language code of the users browser:\n\n```js app.js\nimport { Localizations } from './localizations.js';\n\nclass App {\n\n  constructor() { \n    \n    // Get browser language\n    this.langCode = \n      window.navigator.language.split(\"-\")[0].toUpperCase();\n\n    // Init localization to access via 'app.localization' globally\n    this.localization = Localizations()[this.langCode];\n\n  }\n\n  ...\n```\n\n``app.localization`` now holds the key/value list of the current language.\n\nNow we implement the templating class, as described in [Utilize a repository of reusable ES6 template literals](https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/Utilize-a-repository-of-reusable-ES6-template-literals/) and define a first template called ``helloWorld`` ...\n\n```js templates.js\nclass Templates {\n\n    helloWorld(data) {\n        return this.fillTemplate(`\n            <h1>${app.localization.helloWorld}</h1>\n        `, data);\n    }\n\n    fillTemplate(templateString, templateVars){\n        var func = new Function(...Object.keys(templateVars),  \n          \"return `\" + templateString + \"`;\");\n        return func(...Object.values(templateVars));\n    }\n}\nexport { Templates };\n```\n\nThe inner text of the ``h1`` element in the ``helloWorld`` template refers to the globally available variable ``app.localization``, we initialized in the last step, and points to the translation ``helloWorld``.\n\nIn **app.js** we import the **templates.js** and implement some code in the ``init`` method, to get the template and bring it to the DOM:\n\n```js app.js\nimport { Localizations } from './localizations.js';\nimport { Templates } from './templates.js';\n\nclass App {\n\n  ...\n\n  init() { \n\n    // Get \"Hello World\" H1 element in current language\n    let helloWorld = app.templates.helloWorld({});\n\n    //Insert H1 element into MAIN element\n    document.querySelector(\"main\")\n      .insertAdjacentHTML(\"beforeend\", helloWorld);\n\n  }\n```\n\nThis is it ...\n\nIn the following **Github** repository you will find a solution based on this example, extented with a language selector, cookie support and some helper methods to keep the code nice and clean:\n\n  [https://github.com/kristofzerbe/Native-JavaScript-Multilanguage-Templating](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/Native-JavaScript-Multilanguage-Templating)\n\n![](Native-JavaScript-Multilanguage-Templating/github-solution.gif)","tags":["Localization","Templating","ES6"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Remote Testing and Debugging with Chrome","url":"/post/Remote-Testing-and-Debugging-with-Chrome/","content":"\nDeveloping a website or web app means, you have installed an editor locally on your computer, writing your code locally and start a tiny, built-in web server for debugging locally in your preferred browser.

Some mobile features like ``navigator.canShare`` do not work at all.

You need to \"announce\" this address to your mobile device by using the mechanism called **Port Forwarding**. This is a job for the browser...\n\n1. Connect you mobile device via USB with your local machine\n\n2. Open up **[chrome://inspect/#devices](chrome://inspect/#devices)** in your Chromium based browser (works in all Chromium browsers)\n\n3. Your mobile device will ask you to allow USB-Debugging ... say ``ALLOW``\n\n4. Under ``Devices``, your mobile device will appear after a few seconds ... my is here the ``Pixel 4``\n  \n![DevTools, Devices](Remote-Testing-and-Debugging-with-Chrome/devtools-devices.png)\n\n5.

The shade is grey, boring and has been used and seen many times before...\n\nAn design related [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIXUIXkBHMk/) from Muhammad Abdull of [thewilsonthings](https://www.instagram.com/thewilsonwings), inspired me to **use the image itself as the shadow** in order to make the image look a bit translucent. Should be the same technique as that of a reflection. Here is the HTML/CSS code for it, as the people asking for it in the comments.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nWhat we want to achieve is this:\n\n![Duplicate Image Shadow](Use-a-duplicate-image-to-drop-a-shadow/image-shadow.jpg)\n\nBasically, we use a duplicate of the image and position it below the actual image, but slightly offset and blurred. It won't be a performance issue, as some might think, because it is the very same file and will be loaded only once by the browser.\n\nFor showing two images in the nearly same place in different layers, we need a wrapper...\n\n```html\n<div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n  <img src=\"my-image.jpg\" />\n  <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"my-image.jpg\" />\n</div>\n```\n\n... and some CSS for positioning the images on top of each other first. Here are the defaults for both ``image`` elements:\n\n```css\ndiv.image-wrapper {\n  position: relative;\n}\n\ndiv.image-wrapper img {\n  position: absolute;\n  display: block;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  z-index: 1;\n}\n```\n\nNow we have to style the duplicate image that it looks similar to the shadow. We washing it out using the [blur filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/blur) and the opacity.\n\n```css\ndiv.image-wrapper img.shadow {\n  filter: blur(10px);\n  opacity: 0.8;\n}\n```\n\n![Blurred Duplicate](Use-a-duplicate-image-to-drop-a-shadow/blurred-image.jpg)\n\nLast step is to change the duplicates dimensions and the positioning below the original image. We squeeze it by 10% and shift it from left with half of the value back to the center, shift it from top to make it standout at the bottom and send it to the back by taking a lower z-index than the original image.\n\n```css\ndiv.image-wrapper img.shadow {\n  filter: blur(10px);\n  opacity: 0.8;\n\n  width: 90%;\n  left: 5%;\n  top: 40px;\n  z-index: 0;\n}\n```\n\nThats it.

And there are some pitfalls to be aware of with regard to removal.\n\nAssuming you want to open some kind of sidebar above a container. In this sidebar you have several buttons to show different content via JavaScript and a close button, which closes the sidebar again. You HTML code maybe looks like this:\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"container\">... Main Content ...</div>\n\n    <nav>\n      <button id=\"open-sidebar\">\n    </nav>\n\n    <aside id=\"sidebar\">\n      <div class=\"content\">...

In order to make it easy for the user, the default content (Content 1) will be loaded also and its state will be marked with another class.\n\n```html\n<aside class=\"sidebar open open-content1\">\n```\n\nA click on of the other content buttons (let's say Content 2), will replace the current content and the ``aside`` classes will change into:\n\n```html\n<aside class=\"sidebar open open-content2\">\n```\n\nNow we want to close the sidebar again, assuming that we don't have stored the currently opened content in the JavaScript code...\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nWhat we have to do, is to iterate over all classes of ``aside`` and remove those which starts with ``open``:\n\n```js\nlet sidebar = document.getElementById(\"sidebar\");\nfor (let i = 0; i < sidebar.classList.length; i++) {\n  let value = sidebar.classList[i];\n  if (value.startsWith(\"open\")) {\n    sidebar.classList.remove(value);\n  }\n}\n\n//or\n\nlet sidebar = document.getElementById(\"sidebar\");\nsidebar.classList.forEach(function(value){\n  if(value.includes(\"open\")) {\n    sidebar.classList.remove(value);\n  };\n}); \n```\n\nBoth approaches have a pitfall: when the first class, starting with ``open``, is removed from the list, the length of the ``classList`` array changes immediatly and we won't reach the last class in the list ... !\n\nThe solution is to find and remove all appropriate classes at once, for example by using ``RegEx`` and a reusable helper function:\n\n```js\nfunction removeClassByPrefix(el, prefix) {\n  let pattern = '(' + prefix + '(\\\\s|(-)?(\\\\w*)(\\\\s)?)).*?';\n  var regEx = new RegExp(pattern, 'g');\n  el.className = el.className.replace(regEx, '');\n}\n\n//...\n\nlet sidebar = document.getElementById(\"sidebar\");\nremoveClassByPrefix(sidebar, \"open\");\n```\n\n### Update, 24 Jan 2021\n\nThe first posted RegEx pattern didn't worked properly, because it has found the prefix only and not the whole word, so I have updated the pattern.\n\nYou can try it out at [RegExr.com - Remove Class By Prefix](https://regexr.com/5ktn3).\n","tags":["DOM"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Use and manage multiple Node.js versions on Windows 10","url":"/post/Use-and-manage-multiple-Node-js-versions-on-Windows-10/","content":"\nFor a new project I needed to have Node 14 running on my Windows 10 machine, so installation was done quickly via downloading and running the setup file.\n\nA short time later I wanted to write a new blog post here on kiko.io, which depends on the Node.js based static site generator [Hexo](https://hexo.io) ... and ran into several problems.\n\nFirst of all my hero image processing script (see {% post_link 2020/Automatic-Header-Images-in-Hexo %}) returned an exception.

Therefore the name *template* literals is a bit misleading. But ... there is a way to achieve this anyway...\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Tagged Templates\n\nBeside Template Literals, ES6 introduced **Tagged Templates** (exact: Tagged Template Literals). These tags are functions, which allows you to parse a Template Literal. Definition is like this:\n\n```js\nfunction myTag(literals, ...expressions) {\n  //do the substitution and return a string\n}\n```\n\nYou can use these tags by prefixing you literal:\n```js\nmyTag`Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}!`\n```\n\nUsing Tagged Templates to build a template repository would mean, you have to write one tag function for every template ... doable, but time consuming.\n\n## Dynamic Tag Function\n\nTo avoid this, we can write a universal tag function, which utilizes the [Function constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function), to create the tag function dynamically:\n\n```js\nfunction fillTemplate(templateString, templateVars) {\n\n  var func = new Function(\n    ...Object.keys(templateVars),  \n    \"return `\" + templateString + \"`;\")\n\n  return func(...Object.values(templateVars));\n}\n```\n\n{% alertbox warning %}\n    Don't use this approach on user inputs as expressions, to avoid XSS!\n{% endalertbox %}\n\n## Let's see an example...\n\nGiven is a tiny web app with the following structure:\n\n```html index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Reusable ES6 template literals</title>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/src/style.css\">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <main id=\"main\"></main>\n    <script src=\"src/index.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n```js index.js\nimport { App } from \"./app.js\";\n\nconst app = new App();\n\napp.init();\n```\n\n```js app.js\nclass App {\n  init() {\n    //do something\n  }\n}\nexport { App };\n```\n\nWhat we want to do now, is to load some images into the `main` element, by using a more or less complex element structure:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"photo\">\n  <a href=\"<!-- Url to view the photo -->\"\n     style=\"background-image: url(<!-- Url of the photo file -->);\"></a>\n</div>\n```\n\nTo separate our templates from the main code, we create a template module, which contains the dynamic tag function from above and a `photo` template we want to use in our app\n\n```js template.js\nclass Templates {\n\n  //Template\n  photo(data) {\n    return this.fillTemplate(\n      `\n      <div class=\"photo\">\n        <a href=\"${data.url}/\"\n        style=\"background-image: url(${data.file});\"></a>\n      </div>\n      `,\n      data\n    );\n  }\n\n  //Dynamic Tag Function\n  fillTemplate(templateString, templateVars) {\n    var func = new Function(...Object.keys(templateVars),\n                           \"return `\" + templateString + \"`;\"\n    );\n    return func(...Object.values(templateVars));\n  }\n  \n}\nexport { Templates };\n```\n\nThe template retrieves a `data` object, with the values of the defined expressions, and calls the dynamic tag function on the literal template.\n\nThis we can use now in our app code:\n\n```js app.js\n//Import Template module\nimport { Templates } from \"./templates.js\";\n\nclass App {\n  init() {\n\n    //Initialize Templates\n    this._templates = new Templates();\n\n    //Insert photo into MAIN element\n    let main = document.getElementById(\"main\");\n    main.insertAdjacentHTML(\n      \"beforeend\",\n      this._templates.photo({\n        file: \"my-photo.jpg\",\n        url: \"https://link-to-my.photo.com\"\n      })\n    );\n\n  }\n}\nexport { App };\n```\n\nSee it live at [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/reusable-es6-template-literals-4iyor?file=/src/templates.js).\n\n{% moreinfo '{ \"list\": [\n  [\n    \"Stackoverflow\", \"Can ES6 template literals be substituted at runtime (or reused)?\",\n    \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30003353/can-es6-template-literals-be-substituted-at-runtime-or-reused\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"Github/Adelphos\", \"ES6-Reuseable-Template\",\n    \"https://github.com/Adelphos/ES6-Reuseable-Template\"\n  ]\n]}' %}\n","tags":["Templating","ES6"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Discoveries #5","url":"/post/Discoveries-5/","content":"In this episode of the **Discoveries** (almost) everything is about images and the web.

And I mean [Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html) and not the new web/smartphone based software, which doesn't come even close to the desktop application yet.\n\nI use Lightroom for all purposes after I shot my images: editing, cataloguing, managing and ... publishing. On publishing Lightroom offers you two approaches: *Export* and *Publish*. While *Export* is mainly for creating JPG copies of edited RAW images, *Publish* goes one step further and gives you the ability to do \"something\" with your exported JPG's, for example upload them on Flickr, Instagram, 500px or to your own web server via FTP. Major difference to *Export* is, that *Publish* keeps your images in sync. Everytime you change the source images, the defined publish services recognizes and offer you to re-publish your image.\n\n![Lightroom Publish](Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/lr-re-publish.png)\n\nIn the past years I tried a lot of Lightroom plugins for publishing on several platforms, but it doesn't work out for long, because all these platforms change their API almost every year (or are stamped) and the sparely maintained 3rd party plugins break.\n\nMy workflow for quite some time is to publish my photos on the hard drive, in a folder, which is synced via Dropbox with the cloud. From there I distribute them further.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nImportant on this approach is, to have a coherent output folder structure in order find a particular image afterwards.\n\nI store my RAW images on an external hard drive in a structure like this:\n\n```txt\n<Drive:\\>\n  ->  Fotos\n      ->  <Year>\n          ->  <Year>-<Month> <Eventname>\n```\n\nFirst step after shooting is to copy all RAW files from the SD Card into a new subfolder of the current year. From there I import them into my Lightroom catalog.\n\nAfter sorting, rejecting, editing and flagging in Lightroom, I have to \"export\" the 4- and 5-star rated images into the cloud. There I have a slightly different structure, with a different root folder name and without the year:\n\n```txt\n<Dropbox>\n  ->  Photos\n      ->  <Year>-<Month> <Eventname>\n```\n\nWith the built-in \"Hard Drive\" publish service of Lightroom, it is feasible to \"export\" the images, but not in my wanted folder structure, because it is not possible to use the sources' folder name as output folder name by option. It has to be specified manually each time, which is not very comfortable.\n\n![Hard Disk Publish Service](Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/publish-hard-disk.png)\n\n## Plugin to the rescue\n\nJeffrey Friedl, who is in the Lightroom plugin business about a decade, offers two plugins, which can solve the problem easily:\n\n1. [Jeffrey’s \"**Folder Publisher**\" Lightroom Plugin](http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/folder-publisher)  \n  Exports to disk in a folder hierarchy that mimics the folder hierarchy in your Lightroom catalog\n\nThis one helps me not much, because my output folder would look like this:\n\n```txt\n<Dropbox>\n  ->  Photos\n      ->  Fotos\n          -> <Year>\n              ->  <Year>-<Month> <Eventname>\n```\n\n2. [Jeffrey’s \"**Collection Publisher**” Lightroom Plugin](http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/collection-publisher)  \nExports to local disk in a folder hierarchy that mimics the collection hierarchy you build within Lightroom\n\nBesides the commonality of defining a root folder, where the files are exported to, Jeffrey's plugin has much more options to improve the export.\n\n![Collection Publisher](Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/collection-publisher.png)\n\nAs the main feature, you can create collections within the plugin to define the export targets:\n\n![Create Collection](Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/collection-publisher-create.png)\n\nIn the options of these collections, you can set several templates (variables) to let the plugin name the export subfolder automatically:  \n\n![Collection Options](Folder-based-publishing-in-Lightroom/collection-publisher-options.png)\n\nBy using [Smart Collections](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/help/photo-collections.html#work_with_smart_collections) you don't even need to drag & drop your images to publish to the publish collection.

Create a list below the keyword ``related`` and take the slug (name of the post file) of the posts you want to show below the article as entries:\n\n```yaml\ntitle: My New fancy Post\nrelated:\n  - my-other-post\n  - one-of-my-first-posts\n  - yet-another-post\n```\n\nIn your ``article.ejs`` add a new partial called **related** to the place where it should be shown under the content of the actual article:\n\n```html\n<article \n  id=\"<%= post.layout %>-<%= post.slug %>\" \n  class=\"article article-type-<%= post.layout %>\" \n  itemscope itemprop=\"blogPost\">\n  \n  ...\n\n  <div class=\"article-inner\">\n    <%- post.content %>\n  </div>\n\n  <% if (!index){ %>\n\n    <!-- NEW RELATED PARTIAL -->\n    <%- partial('post/related') %>\n\n    <%- partial('post/comments') %>\n    <%- partial('post/nav') %>\n  <% } %>\n\n</article>\n```\n\nIn the folder ``themes/landscape/layout/_partial/post``, where all partials are stored which belongs to posts, create the new partial file:\n\n```html related.ejs\n<% if (post.related && post.related.length){ %>\n  <div class=\"article-related\">\n    <h2>Related</h2>\n    <div class=\"archives\">\n\n      <!-- Loop through the Frontmatter list of RELATED posts -->  \n      <% post.related.forEach(function(item) { %>\n\n        <!--Determine the post(s) with the given slug -->  \n        <%\n          var posts = site.posts.filter(function(post) {\n            return post.slug.toLowerCase() === item.toLowerCase();\n          });\n        %>\n\n        <!-- Loop through the post(s) and render the archive panel -->\n        <% posts.each(function(post) { %>\n          <%- partial('../archive-post', { post: post, show_link: true }) %>\n        <% }); %>\n\n      <% }); %>\n\n    </div>\n  </div>\n<% } %>\n```\n\n<small><em>(Remove the comments, because they doesn't belong to EJS)</em></small>\n\nIn this partial we loop through the Frontmatter list of related posts, determine the post by the given slug and render an archive panel for each post.\n\nThe list ``site.posts`` should always contain a slug just once, therefore getting an array of posts and looping is just a precuation.\n\nWhat you are getting you can see below...","tags":["Hexo","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Discoveries #3 - Tutorials","url":"/post/Discoveries-3-Tutorials/","content":"Some articles I stumble upon in my daily routine of reading news and blogs are diving very deep in a certain topic, especially if they are describing the basics of techniques I use every day. \n\nAll of the following reading tips are of the type \"ahh, that's why this works like that\" or \"uuh, I just scatch on the surface on that\".

Should be nothing regarding layout, because for this we have [``CSS Media Queries``](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries). \n\nSomewhere around 2011 W3C introduced [``matchMedia()``](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia), which *returns a MediaQueryList object that can be used to detemnine if the document matches the media query string.* The using is pretty straightforward and feels a bit like RegEx matching in JS:\n\n```js\nconst mediaQuery = window.matchMedia('(min-width: 1025px)')\nif (mediaQuery.matches) {\n  // do something...  \n}\n```\n\nIf you are interested in this API, you will find good introductions to the topic [here](https://css-tricks.com/working-with-javascript-media-queries/), [here](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/06/using-window-matchmedia-to-do-media-queries-in-javascript/) and [here (German)](https://www.mediaevent.de/javascript/window-matchMedia.html).\n\nOne point of criticism on this pure JS approach can be, that you have to maintain the breakpoints in addition to CSS ... **but why not use these existing breakpoints in JS**?\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nIf you implement a feature that is based on the different device classes, you don't have to determine the current class with dozens of lines of JavaScript code, if you just can ask the DOM.\n\n## The CSS/JS Breakpoint Hack\n\nFor this approach, we take advantage of the fact, that CSS can be used to define not only styles, but also content. We always use it, when showing an icon by using a symbol font like FontAwesome:\n\n```css\nmy-fancy-icon::before {\n  font-family: FontAwesome5Solid;\n  content: \"\\f186\";\n}\n```\n\nMixed with a ``@media`` rule, we can \"inject\" the needed device value into the DOM, for example into the ``BODY`` tag, but you can take whatever you want:\n\n```css\n@media (min-width: 1025px) {\n  body:before {\n    content: \"DESKTOP\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nJust one line more in the masses of CSS code to make a Web App responsive, but with this one you can do without many lines of JS.\n\nNow you can read out this value via JavaScript by getting the styles of the tag and get the injected content:\n\n```js\n  var style = window.getComputedStyle(document.querySelector(\"body\"), \":before\");\n  var breakpoint = style.getPropertyValue(\"content\").replace(/\\\"/g, \"\");\n```\n\nIt is advisable to embed this request into an event listener of ``DOMContentLoaded``, because the rule has to be set, before you can access it.\n\nSee a simple working pen:\n\n{% codepen WNwWjBR 'CSS/JS Breakpoint Hack' css %}\n","tags":["CSS","Browser","MediaQuery"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"404 Page in Hexo for GitHub Pages","url":"/post/404-Page-in-Hexo-for-GitHub-Pages/","content":"As this blog is a static one, generated by [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and hostet at [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/), the page which was shown, when a user enters an Url which points to nowhere, was the default GitHub 404 page.\n\n![GitHub 404 Page](github-404-page.png)\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nNot optimal and should be solved by an own Hexo page, because **GitHub Pages allows you to deliver a custom 404 page** by creating simply a ``404.html`` in the root of the website.\n\nAs you can create separate pages in Hexo, this is done quickly by:\n\n```cmd\nhexo new page \"404\"\n```\n\nIt generates a new folder named ``404`` in your ``source`` folder, where a ``index.md`` is placed. In this file you can enter the text as Markdown  you want to show to the user, in case of a 404 error (page not found) occurs.\n\nOn generating the static files by ``hexo generate``, a subfolder ``404`` with a ``index.html`` will be created, which doesn't really work with GitHub Pages, because it needs a ``404.htm`` in the root.\n\nYou can fix this, by defining the ``permalink`` in the Frontmatter of your page:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: 404\npermalink: /404.html\n---\n```\n\nExample ... click here: [https://kiko.io/no-page-here](https://kiko.io/no-page-here)","tags":["Hexo","GitHub","Error"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Pimping the Permalink","url":"/post/Pimping-the-Permalink/","content":"\nUntil now I did not show the permalink under my posts in this blog, but in the past I had sometimes the need to pass one of the links and it was not very user-friendly, on desktop as well as on mobile. Not the One-Click experience I prefer.\n\nMy goal was to show the permalink and, even more important, provide a simple way to copy and to share. JavaScript to the rescue...\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Display\nAs I run my blog with [Hexo](https://hexo.io), I deal with ``EJS`` files. To show the permalink in my ``article.ejs``, was quite simple. First step was to create a new partial file named ``permalink.ejs``, to be called every time when the complete article has to be rendered:\n\n```js\n<% if (!index){ %>\n  <%- partial('post/permalink', { class_name: 'article-permalink' }) %>\n<% } %>\n```\n\nThe partial file looked like this in this step:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"<%= class_name %>\"\">\n    <a id=\"article-permalink\" href=\"<%- post.permalink %>\"><%- post.permalink %></a>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Copy\n\nAs I read a little bit about the possibilities to copy text into the clipboard via JavaScript on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Interact_with_the_clipboard), it became obvious that a link is not the best solution, because using the ``exeCommand`` needs to have something selected and this is difficult on anchors. Then ... do it with an input:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"<%= class_name %>\"\">\n    <input id=\"article-permalink\" value=\"<%- post.permalink %>\" />\n    <a id=\"action-copy\" class=\"article-action\" href=\"javascript:copyPermalink();\"></a>\n</div>\n<script>\n  var copyText = document.querySelector(\"#article-permalink\");\n  \n  //Disable Input by default\n  copyText.disabled = true;\n\n  function copyPermalink() {\n    //Enable Input\n    copyText.disabled = false;\n\n    //Select permalink text\n    copyText.select();\n\n    //Copy to clipboard\n    document.execCommand(\"copy\");\n\n    //Remove selection again\n    copyText.blur();\n\n    //Disable Input again\n    copyText.disabled = true;\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nNice, but a user feedback, that the text has been copied to the clipboard, was advisable, because nothing is more annoying, when you click somewhere and nothing seems to happen. As I hate default browser confirmations and other distracting messaging methods, I wanted to use the input itself, by fading out the link text, replace it with a message and fade in the text again:\n\n![Copy Animation](Pimping-the-Permalink/copy-animation.gif)\n\nI extended my ``animation.styl`` (Hexo works with [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/)) with two keyframe animations ... one for fading in, one for fading out...\n\n```styl\n@keyframes fadeIn {\n  0% {\n    opacity:0;\n  }\n  100% {\n    opacity:1;\n  }\n}\n.fade-in-500\n  animation: fadeIn ease 0.5s;\n.fade-in-1000\n  animation: fadeIn ease 1s;\n\n@keyframes fadeOut {\n  0% {\n    opacity:1;\n  }\n  100% {\n    opacity:0;\n  }\n}\n.fade-out-500\n  animation: fadeOut ease 0.5s;\n.fade-out-1000\n  animation: fadeOut ease 1s;\n```\n\n... and wrote a setTimeout cascade to achive the effect:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"<%= class_name %>\"\">\n    <input id=\"article-permalink\" value=\"<%- post.permalink %>\" />\n    <a class=\"article-action action-copy\" href=\"javascript:copyPermalink();\"></a>\n</div>\n<script>\n  var copyText = document.querySelector(\"#article-permalink\");\n  copyText.disabled = true;\n  function copyPermalink() {\n      copyText.disabled = false;\n      copyText.select();\n      document.execCommand(\"copy\");\n      copyText.blur();\n      copyText.disabled = true;\n\n    //Store original text\n    var permalink = copyText.value;\n\n    //Start fading out\n    copyText.classList.add(\"fade-out-500\");\n\n    //Wait until animation is done\n    setTimeout(function(){\n\n        //Set message, remove fadout class and add start fading in\n        copyText.value = \"copied to clipboard\";\n        copyText.classList.remove(\"fade-out-500\");\n        copyText.classList.add(\"fade-in-1000\");\n\n        //Wait 2 seconds to show the message\n        setTimeout(function() {\n\n            //Start to fade out message\n            copyText.classList.add(\"fade-out-500\");\n\n            //Wait until animation is done\n            setTimeout(function() {\n\n                //Set original text again and remove fadout class\n                copyText.value = permalink;\n                copyText.classList.remove(\"fade-out-500\");\n\n                //Wait until animation is done\n                setTimeout(function() {\n\n                    //Remove fadeout class\n                    copyText.classList.remove(\"fade-in-1000\");\n                }, 500);\n            }, 500);\n        }, 2000);\n    }, 500);\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\n## Share\n\nThe second permalink feature was a little bit trickier, because I didn't want to use one of the sharing libraries out there, whose business model is based on my readers data (always keep conservative on implementing third party stuff, because you never know what they are doing with the data). But a couple of months ago I read about a new native browser API for WebApps on the rise: **Web Share API**.\n\nSince 2019 [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) is working on this API, *for sharing text, links and other content to an arbitrary destination of the user's choice*. On 27 August 2020 the published a [Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-share/) and on 16 September 2020 the latest [Editors Draft](https://w3c.github.io/web-share/).\n\n![Can I Use - Web Share, state today](Pimping-the-Permalink/caniuse-web-share.png)\n\nBrand new stuff. The browser support is not the best yet, but it will be getting better in the near feature, especially as Edge Chrome is one of the early adopters.\n\n![Web Share in Edge Chrome](Pimping-the-Permalink/web-share-edge-chrome.png)\n\n[web.dev](https://web.dev/web-share/) lists important requirements on using this new feature in JavaScript:\n\n* It can only be used on a site that supports HTTPS\n* It must be invoked in response to a user action such as a click\n\nBut it can share URL's, text and even files! \n\nA raw implementation can be:\n\n```js\nif (navigator.share === undefined) {\n  navigator.share({\n    title: 'My Post',\n    url: 'https://my-domain.com/my-url',\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log('Successful share'))\n  .catch((error) => console.log('Error sharing', error));\n} else {\n  // fallback\n}\n```\n\nI refrain to implement a fallback, rather I would like to show the appropriate button only to those users, whose browser supports it:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"<%= class_name %>\"\">\n    <input id=\"article-permalink\" value=\"<%- post.permalink %>\" data-id=\"<%= post._id %>\" />\n    <a id=\"action-copy\" class=\"article-action\" href=\"javascript:copyPermalink();\"></a>\n    <a id=\"action-share\" class=\"article-action\" href=\"javascript:sharePermalink();\"></a>\n</div>\n<script>\n    function copyPermalink() {\n      -- SEE ABOVE\n    }\n\n    if (navigator.share === undefined) {\n        var shareLink = document.querySelector(\"#action-share\");\n        shareLink.style.display = \"none\";\n    }\n\n    function sharePermalink() {\n        navigator.share({\n            title: \"<%- post.title %>\",\n            url: \"<%- post.permalink %>\",\n        })\n    }\n</script>\n```\n\n{% moreinfo '{ \"list\": [\n  [\n  \"w3c.github.io\", \"W3C Web Share Test\",\n  \"https://w3c.github.io/web-share/demos/share-files.html\"\n  ],\n  [\n  \"heise Developer\", \"Features von übermorgen: Die Web Share API und die Web Share Target API (German)\",\n  \"https://www.heise.de/developer/artikel/Features-von-uebermorgen-Die-Web-Share-API-und-die-Web-Share-Target-API-3506197.html\"\n  ],\n  [\n  \"CSS-Tricks\", \"How to Use the Web Share API\",\n  \"https://css-tricks.com/how-to-use-the-web-share-api/\"\n  ]\n]}' %}\n","tags":["Hexo","CSS","Stylus","Share"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"Discoveries #2","url":"/post/Discoveries-2/","content":"New month, new discoveries.

As I am a big [Trello](https://trello.com) fan, I wanted to give it a chance to be Pockets successor on my smartphone, where I'm reading mostly.\n\nOn installing the Trello Android app, you will find a new SHARE target **Add new Trello card**, which is comfortable to use:\n\n(Sry, for the German screenshots ;)\n\n![Android's default share with New Trello Card](android-share-website.png)\n\nThe result, website's title and Url set, is nice at best:\n\n![Trello card via Android Share](card-via-share.png)\n\n... but Trello has a **[Bookmarklet](https://trello.com/add-card)**, which does the job much better.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n{% alertbox info %}\nThe following approach works best in the Google Chrome browser.\n{% endalertbox %}\n\nFirst, a Bookmarklet is a small piece of JavaScript, which is stored as a bookmark in your browser. As you can't actually create such a Bookmarklet in your Android Chrome, you have to create it in your desktop Chrome and switch on the bookmark sync of chrome. You should right away choose a short, concise name for the bookmark, so you find it easier in Android Chrome afterwards. I called it **2TrelloCard**, because few websites start with an number.\n\nAfter Chrome's sync is done, go to any website do you want to store as a Trello card. Now enter the Url box and type the name of the bookmarklet and select it.\n\nInstead of requesting a different page, Chrome executes the JavaScript of the Bookmarklet against the currently open website. This script shows a Trello dialog, where you can choose, which board and list the new card should be created on.\n\n![Open Bookmarklet on Website in Android Chrome](open-bookmarklet.gif)\n\nThis card creation method not only sets the title of the card, but fills the description with the [meta description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element) of the page, adds the first found meta image as cover and adds the Url as an attachment:\n\n![Trello card via Bookmarklet](card-via-bookmarklet.png)\n","tags":["Trello","Browser"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Horizontal navigation menu above an image","url":"/post/Horizontal-navigation-menu-above-an-image/","content":"\nI changed the main menu of my blog, because I wanted to get rid of the hamburger menu on the upper left, which was shown only for smartphones, but was not really reachable conveniently.

As I have quite big header images and I wanted to place the new navigation in a more accessible zone, I decided to place it at the bottom, but above the header image.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nProblem was, not to cover a big part of the image with a full-colored or even semitransparent bar, by using a RGBA background color.

It is [supported by most modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-backdrop-filter), but it has to have a backup strategy for the rest of the bunch.\n\nThe HTML is simple: \n\n```html\n<nav id=\"header-nav\" role=\"navigation\">\n  <ul class=\"menu\">        \n  \n    <li class=\"menu-item\">\n      <a href=\"/first\" title=\"First\">\n        <span>First Item</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n            \n    <li class=\"menu-item\">\n      <a href=\"/second\" title=\"Second\">\n        <span>Second Item</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n    \n  </ul>\n</nav>\n```\n\nAnd here's the [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/docs) code for my approach:\n\n```styl\n#header-nav\n  position: absolute\n  bottom: 0\n  width: 100%\n  height: auto\n  box-sizing: content-box\n  overflow-x: scroll\n  overflow-y: hidden\n  \n  // BACKDROP-FILTER\n  backdrop-filter: blur(5px) brightness(90%)\n  @supports not (backdrop-filter: none)\n    background: rgba(0,0,0,0.25)\n  \n  // SCROLLBAR\n  &::-webkit-scrollbar\n    display: none\n  @supports not (webkit-scrollbar)  \n    scrollbar-width: none\n  \n  .menu\n    display: flex\n    list-style: none\n    margin: 0\n    padding: 0\n    \n    .menu-item\n      flex-basis: 80px \n      flex-shrink: 0\n      flex-grow: 1\n      max-width: 100px\n      margin: 0 2px\n      text-overflow: ellipsis;\n      \n      a\n        display: inline-block\n        width: 100%\n        padding: 10px 0\n        color: #ffffff\n        font-weight: bold\n        text-decoration: none\n        text-align: center        \n```\n\nThe navigation box is ``absolute`` positioned on the image, is as wide as the screen and scrolls exclusively horizontal. The items are a unordered list, with default width and arranged by ``flex``.\n\nIn case a browser doesn't understand ``backdrop-filter``, the navigation bar is shown with a classic alpha channel opacity.\n\nWhen having a horizontal scroll feature, the scrollbar shown by the browser is beyond beautiful. To prevent this, I used the CSS pseudo element ``::-webkit-scrollbar``, which is supported by WebKit and Blink bowsers, with a fallback for all other browsers. Both strategies allows to be still able to scroll. If you want to have a scrollbar, but not the built-in, I can only recommend to read something about styling scrollbars, like [here](https://css-tricks.com/custom-scrollbars-in-webkit/) and [here](https://css-tricks.com/the-current-state-of-styling-scrollbars/).","tags":["CSS","Stylus"],"categories":["UI-Design"]},{"title":"Change CSS class when element scrolls into viewport","url":"/post/Change-CSS-class-when-element-scrolls-into-viewport/","content":"I had a neat visual gimmick on the start page of this blog, that the gray-scaled header image of a post in the list scaled up to 100% and became colored, when the user hovered over it:\n\n```css\n.article-inner .article-photo {\n  height: 150px;\n  width: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n  transform: scale(1);\n  transform-style: preserve-3d;\n  transition: all ease-out 0.6s;\n  opacity: 0.3;\n  filter: grayscale(1) contrast(0.5);\n}\n.article-inner:hover .article-photo {\n  transform: scale(1.1);\n  opacity: 1;\n  filter: grayscale(0) contrast(1);\n}\n```\n\nNice, but a little bit useless on smartphones or tablets, where HOVER  doesn't really work.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nA better idea was to transform the header image automatically, when it becomes visible to the user.

Disqus is probably not without reason under criticism by many people in the community.\n\nAs I host this blog at GitHub (see [A New Blog (Part One): VS Code, Hexo and GitHub Pages](/categories/Tools/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/)) I was looking for a solution to host the comments also on my prefered platform. There were some solutions, which uses GitHub Issues for this and wanted to implement something like that someday.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nAs I read a post from on [Thomas Lavesques' blog](https://thomaslevesque.com), to solve another problem, his commenting section came to my attention: **[utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/)** ... exactly the solution I needed! Thanx guys...\n\nOn their website is a small configurator for a script to implement in each post, which needs only few information:\n\n* Name of the Repo\n* How the mapping of the post to the Issues should work\n* Name of the Theme, in order to fit to the colors of the blog\n\nThe script had to be included to my Hexo ``article.js``:\n\n```ejs\n<% if (!index && post.comments){ %>\n  <script src=\"https://utteranc.es/client.js\"\n    repo=\"kristofzerbe/kiko.io\"\n    issue-term=\"pathname\"\n    theme=\"github-light\"\n    crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n    async>\n  </script>\n<% } %>\n```\n\nThat's pretty much it. On entering the first comment, Utterances told me to install the needed GitHub App to my repo, in order to make it work ... and done.\n\n![Utterances GitHub App](Using-GitHub-as-Commenting-Platform/utteranc-github-app.png)\n\nThe result you see below ...\n\n## UPDATE...\n\nThe utterances script tag has the attribute ``theme``, to tell utterances  which style should be delivered. There are several themes available, but if users are able to switch between light or dark mode on the page (see [Hexo and the Dark Mode](/categories/Tools/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode)), the comment block should change to an suitable theme also.\n\nOn order to respond on a mode change, it is necessary to write a more dynamic script loading.\n\nFirst we define a function in a global script file to load the utterances script via JS:\n\n```js\nfunction insertUtterancesCommentBlock() {\n    var commentTheme = \"github-light\";\n    if(localStorage.getItem(\"theme\") === \"dark\"){\n      commentTheme = \"github-dark\";\n    }\n    const scriptId = \"comment-theme-script\";\n    const existingScript = document.getElementById(scriptId);\n    if (!existingScript) {\n      const commentScript = document.createElement(\"script\");\n      commentScript.id = scriptId;\n      commentScript.src = \"https://utteranc.es/client.js\";\n      commentScript.setAttribute(\"repo\", \"kristofzerbe/kiko.io\");\n      commentScript.setAttribute(\"issue-term\", \"pathname\");\n      commentScript.setAttribute(\"theme\", commentTheme);\n      commentScript.setAttribute(\"crossorigin\", \"anonymous\");\n      const placeholder = document.getElementById(\"comment-placeholder\");\n      placeholder.innerHTML = \"\";\n      placeholder.appendChild(commentScript);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen we change the placement in the EJS file, by defining a placeholder  and ensuring that the script above is loaded, before we call it:\n\n```ejs\n<div id=\"comment-placeholder\"></div>\n<script>\n  window.addEventListener('load', function () {\n    insertUtterancesCommentBlock();\n  })\n</script>\n```\n\nOn my blog, everytime the user switches between light/dark mode the ``body`` tag will be decorated with the data tag ``data-theme`` and the value of the mode. To keep the loading of the utterances script independent from this functionality, we just have to listen to this change via ``MutationObserver``:\n\n```js\n//observe theme change, to adjust comment block theme\nvar target = document.documentElement,\n    observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) {\n        mutations.forEach(function(mutation) {\n            if (mutation.attributionName === \"data-theme\" );\n                insertUtterancesCommentBlock();\n            });        \n    }),\n    config = { attributes: true };\nobserver.observe(target, config);\n```","tags":["Hexo","GitHub","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Meaningful automatic versioning with T4","url":"/post/Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/","content":"\nEvery developer has to have an idea of versioning his products. If you work with Visual Studio you have the ``Assembly Information`` in the project properties dialog, to enter it manually everytime you want to release a new version:\n\n![Assembly Information Dialog](Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/AssemblyInformationDialog.png)\n\nThe four fields are: MAJOR, MINOR, BUILD, REVISION.\n\nBut seriously ... who does that? I guess 99% of all C# developers are entering the ``AssemblyInfo.cs`` and enter the famous 2 asterisks into the version declaration of BUILD and REVISION, to let Visual Studio do the incrementation job:\n\n```c#\n[assembly: AssemblyVersion(\"1.0.*.*\")]\n[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion(\"1.0.*.*\")]\n```\n\nBut this is not the end of the possibilities ... Let's do it more meaningful, with some goodies and still automatic...\n<!-- more -->\n\n## More informative versioning\n\nA build with an increased MAJOR version number means, that there are significant changes in the product, even breaking changes. This always should be set manually.\n\nAlso the MINOR. It stands for significant functional extensions of the product.\n\nHow does Visual Studio calculate BUILD and REVISION?\n\n{% blockquote %}\nWhen specifying a version, you have to at least specify major. If you specify major and minor, you can specify an asterisk for build. This will cause **build** to be equal to the **number of days since January 1, 2000 local time**, and for **revision** to be equal to the **number of seconds since midnight local time, divided by 2**.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nBut, the BUILD number should explain, how often a software with a particular MAJOR.MINOR has been build, due to minor changes and bug fixes.\n\nThe \"Asterisk\" REVISION number is a little weird, but at least with the BUILD number unique. But it says nothing. Better to pick up the idea of a date calculated, unique number, but not an arbitrary date ... let's take the date the project has started.\n\nFor example: **1.2.16.158** ... reads version 1.2 with 16 builds on the 158'th day after the project has started.\n\n## Start with T4\n\nT4 (Text Template Transformation Toolkit) is a templating system in Visual Studio for generating text files during design time. It is very suitable to even generate code. Read about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/code-generation-and-t4-text-templates) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/writing-a-t4-text-template).\n\nA Text Template (.tt) has **Directives** (how the template is processed), **Text blocks** (text copied to the output) and **Control blocks** (program code).\n\nFor our versioning template, we start with this in a new file named **``AssemblyVersion.tt``**:\n\n*Directives*:\n\n```xml\n<#@ template hostspecific=\"true\" language=\"C#\" #>\n<#@ output extension=\".cs\" #>\n```\n\n*Control block*:\n\n```c#\n<#\n  int major = 1;\n  int minor = 0;\n  int build = 0;\n  int revision = 0;\n#>\n```\n\n*Text block*:\n\n```c#\n// This code was generated by a tool. Any changes made manually will be lost\n// the next time this code is regenerated.\n\nusing System.Reflection;\n\n[assembly: AssemblyVersion(\"<#= $\"{major}.{minor}.{build}.{revision}\" #>\")]\n[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion(\"<#= $\"{major}.{minor}.{build}.{revision}\" #>\")]\n```\n\nOn saving the TT file, a new CS file with the same name will be created automatically and you got an error like this:\n\n![Duplicate Attributes Error](Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/DuplicateAttributes.png)\n\n### A new place for version info\n\nTh error occurs, because we have now **two** ``AssemblyVersion`` and ``AssemblyFileVersion`` attributes in our project. We need to comment out the original in ``Properties\\AssemblyInfo.cs``:\n\n![Change AssemblyInfo.cs](Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/ChangeAssemblyInfo.png)\n\n### Structural Considerations\n\nIt makes sense to store all needed files for the new versioning system in a new root folder of the project, named **AssemblyVersion**, starting with the ``AssemblyVersion.tt``, because there will be more files later on.\n\n## New app information file\n\nAs we replaced the original version attributes in the project with those from our generated  ``AssemblyVersion.cs``, we cannot control the MAJOR and MINOR version number via the project property dialog any longer. We need a new approach on that, which can be edited easily and processed automatically.\n\n### AssemblyVersion.json\n\n```js\n{\n  \"initialDate\": \"2019-09-29\",\n  \"versions\": [\n    {\n      \"major\": 1,\n      \"minor\": 1,\n      \"releaseDate\": \"\",\n      \"remarks\": \"Some cool new features; New versioning system\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"major\": 1,\n      \"minor\": 0,\n      \"releaseDate\": \"2019-10-01\",\n      \"remarks\": \"Initial Release\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis new JSON file has two main items:\n* ``initialDate`` - the date the project has started, to calculate the REVISION later on\n* ``versions`` - a list with all different MAJOR/MINOR versions we have done so far, with at least one without a release date ... the one with the highest ``major`` and ``minor``.\n\nThe ``remarks`` attribute of a list item holds some information about the changes in a new version. Together with ``releaseDate``, useful for a possible release history, shown in the product itself.\n\n### Library references in T4\n\nT4 runs in its own app domain, therefore it can use built-in libraries as ``System.IO``, but not third-party libraries like ``Newtonsoft.JSON``. \n\nWe could reference those libraries from the projects package folder via the absolute path (if we use it in our product), but when we are running a NuGet update, the reference will break. \n\nIt is advisable to store such libraries directly in a fixed folder, like **AssemblyVersion\\Libraries**. They won't have any impact to our product, because the are only used while design time.\n\n## The MAJOR and MINOR\n\nTo process the new ``AssemblyVersion.json`` in the template, we need some new directives for referencing the needed libraries and the import of the appropriate namepaces:\n\n```xml\n<#@ assembly name=\"System.Core\" #>\n<#@ assembly name=\"$(SolutionDir)\\AssemblyVersion\\Libraries\\Newtonsoft.Json.dll\" #>\n\n<#@ import namespace=\"System.IO\" #>\n<#@ import namespace=\"System.Linq\" #>\n<#@ import namespace=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" #>\n```\n\nVia the use of the T4 variable ``$(SolutionDir)``, we can point to our copy of Newtonsoft JSON.\n\nNow we can read and convert the JSON into an anonymous object and get the highest values of MAJOR and MINOR:\n\n```c#\n<#\n    string avPath = this.Host.ResolvePath(\"AssemblyVersion.json\");\n    string avJson = File.ReadAllText(avPath);\n\n    var avDefinition = new {\n        initialDate = \"\",\n        versions = new [] {\n            new {\n                major = 0,\n                minor = 0,\n                releaseDate = \"\",\n                remarks = \"\" }\n        }\n    };\n    var avObject = JsonConvert.DeserializeAnonymousType(avJson, avDefinition);\n\n    //Get highest Major/Minor from versions list\n    var maxVersion = avObject.versions\n      .OrderByDescending(i => i.major)\n      .ThenByDescending(j => j.minor)\n      .First();\n\n    //Set MAJOR\n    int major = maxVersion.major;\n\n    //Set MINOR\n    int minor = maxVersion.minor;\n#>\n```\n\n## The BuildLog\n\nIn order to get the version number for BUILD, we need a method to count and store every build that has been run, separated by the MAJOR/MINOR versions. This is a job for a **Post-build event**, which can be configured in the project properties dialog. The event uses shell commands as they are used on the command line.\n\nWhat the commands should do:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write a new line with the current date and time in a log file, named after the MAJOR/MINOR version and stored in the folder **AssemblyVersion\\BuildLogs**.\n\n![Build Log](Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/BuildLog.png)\n\n### Extending build event macros\n\nShell commands for build events are supporting built-in variables, so called 'macros', like ``$(ProjectDir)`` (which returns the project directory path), but there is no such macro for the current version number. We have to introduce it via extending the project with a new build target.\n\nUnload the project in Visual Studio for editing the CSPROJ (or VBPROJ) file of your product manually and write the following definition just before the end-tag:\n\n```xml\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <PostBuildEventDependsOn>\n      $(PostBuildEventDependsOn);\n      PostBuildMacros;\n    </PostBuildEventDependsOn>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <Target Name=\"PostBuildMacros\">\n    <GetAssemblyIdentity AssemblyFiles=\"$(TargetPath)\">\n      <Output TaskParameter=\"Assemblies\" ItemName=\"Targets\" />\n    </GetAssemblyIdentity>\n    <ItemGroup>\n      <VersionNumber Include=\"@(Targets->'%(Version)')\" />\n    </ItemGroup>\n  </Target>\n```\n\nAfter reloading the project in Visual Studio, we can use ``@(VersionNumber)`` in our commands.\n\n### CreateBuildLog.bat\n\nThe event build editor is not very comfortable, so we create the batch file ``CreateBuildLog.bat`` in our **AssemblyVersion** folder and use this as the post build event command.\n\n{% alertbox exclamation %}\nThe BuildLog folder must exist, before running the following command the first time!\n{% endalertbox %}\n\n```bat\n@echo off\n\nREM --Get parameters\nset PROJECT_DIR=%1\nset VERSION_NUMBER=%2\n\nREM --Set what to log\nset LOG_LINE=%DATE% %TIME%\n\nREM --Inform the user\nset MSG=CreateBuildLog '%LOG_LINE%' for version %VERSION_NUMBER%\necho %MSG%\n\nREM --Get version parts\nFOR /f \"tokens=1,2,3,4 delims=.\" %%a IN (\"%VERSION_NUMBER%\") do (\n\tset MAJOR=%%a\n\tset MINOR=%%b\n\tset BUILD=%%c\n\tset REVISION=%%d\n)\n\nREM --Define BuildLog file and folder \nset BUILDLOG_FILE=%MAJOR%.%MINOR%.log\nset BUILDLOG_FOLDER=%PROJECT_DIR%\\AssemblyVersion\\BuildLogs\n\nREM --Write current date and time as new line in the file\necho %LOG_LINE% >> %BUILDLOG_FOLDER%\\%BUILDLOG_FILE%\"\n```\n\n![Post Build Event](Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/PostBuildEvent.png)\n\n```bat\n\"$(ProjectDir)\\AssemblyVersion\\CreateBuildLog.bat\" \"$(ProjectDir)\" @(VersionNumber)\n```\n\n## The BUILD\n\nAs we have now the BuildLogs, we can use them in the template:\n\n```c#\n<#\n    ...\n\n    //Get BuildLog of max version\n    string buildlogFolder = this.Host.ResolvePath(\"BuildLogs\");\n    string buildLog = \n      buildlogFolder + \"\\\\\" +\n      maxVersion.major + \".\" +\n      maxVersion.minor + \".log\";\n\n    //Get number of lines from BuildLog or create a new log (!)\n    var buildCount = 1;\n    if (File.Exists(buildLog)) {\n        buildCount = File.ReadLines(buildLog).Count() + 1;\n    } else {\n        File.Create(buildLog).Dispose();\n    }\n\n    //Set BUILD\n    int build = buildCount;\n#>\n```\n\nVery important is to create the log file, if it doesn't exists! Otherwise the build will always fail, because the version attributes can't be created.\n\n## The REVISION\n\nAt least we have to set the REVISION number, by calculating the difference between the current date and the ``initialDate``, which we have previously read from the ``AssemblyVersion.json``:\n\n```c#\n<#\n    ...\n\n    //Set REVISION\n    var dateCreated = DateTime.Parse(avObject.initialDate);\n    int revision = (DateTime.Now.Date - dateCreated.Date).Days;\n#>\n```\n\n## Transforming T4 template on build\n\nThe last hurdle is to run the text transformation every time you build your product. Until now it runs only on saving the ``AssemblyVersion.tt``.\n\nA great helper on that was Thomas Levesque's post [\"Transform T4 templates as part of the build, and pass variables from the project\"](https://thomaslevesque.com/2017/11/13/transform-t4-templates-as-part-of-the-build-and-pass-variables-from-the-project/), where he describes every difficulty to reach this goal.\n\nTo make it short: We have to edit the CSPROJ file again, to introduce TextTemplating to MSBuild.\n\nFirst we need following near the beginning of the projects XML:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n    <VisualStudioVersion Condition=\"'$(VisualStudioVersion)' == ''\">\n      16.0\n    </VisualStudioVersion>\n    <VSToolsPath Condition=\"'$(VSToolsPath)' == ''\">\n      $(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v$(VisualStudioVersion)\n    </VSToolsPath>\n    <TransformOnBuild>true</TransformOnBuild>\n    <OverwriteReadOnlyOutputFiles>true</OverwriteReadOnlyOutputFiles>\n    <TransformOutOfDateOnly>false</TransformOutOfDateOnly>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\nSecondly add the IMPORT of the TextTemplating target AFTER the CSharp target:\n\n```xml\n<Import Project=\"$(MSBuildToolsPath)\\Microsoft.CSharp.targets\" />\n...\n<Import Project=\"$(VSToolsPath)\\TextTemplating\\Microsoft.TextTemplating.targets\" />\n```\n\nIf you build your product now, a new build log is created and the version numbers BUILD and REVISION are automatically increased.\n\n## See it in action\n\nThe project where I implemented this versioning first is [HexoCommander](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/HexoCommander). Feel free to download the code and see how the new versioning mechanism works.\n\n![Screencast Build HexoCommander](Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/screencast-build-hexocommander.gif)\n\nEnjoy versioning...","tags":["Visual Studio","Versioning","T4"],"categories":["C#"]},{"title":"Automatic Header Images in Hexo","url":"/post/Automatic-Header-Images-in-Hexo/","content":"\nEvery article in this blog has an individual header image, to bring a little bit color into it. In this post I will show you how I deal with the images in using and automatic provisioning.\n\nFor serving these pictures I use a static folder, as described in [A New Blog: Customizing Hexo](/categories/Tools/A-New-Blog-Customizing-Hexo/). The hard work is done by the plugin [Hexo Generator Copy](https://github.com/niahoo/hexo-generator-copy), which copies the static files into the ``public_dir`` while generating.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Static File Structure\n\nIt is always advisable to provide one image for every device class, in order to save bandwidth and make the page loading as fast as possible:\n\n```txt\n| static/\n   | photos/\n      | mobile/\n         | my-lovely-picture.jpg\n         | ...\n      | tablet/\n         | my-lovely-picture.jpg\n         | ...\n      | normal/\n         | my-lovely-picture.jpg\n         | ...\n```\n\nThe ``mobile`` images are at least 480 pixels wide, the ``tablet`` variants 768 pixels and the standard or ``normal`` one 1280 pixels.\n\nWhile creating the JPG files, it is important to compress them with a tool like [JPEGMini](https://www.jpegmini.com/) to save data while loading.\n\n## Binding\n\nIn order to bind a picture with some additional information to an article, I have extended the Frontmatter of every post:\n\n```yaml\nphotograph:\n    file: 'my-lovely-image.jpg'\n    name: 'My Lovely Image'\n    link: 'https://500px.com/photo/123456789/My-Lovely-Image'\n```\n\n## Usage in Theme\n\nIt relies on your Hexo theme, how to use a header image. In my theme (derived from the standard theme) I just added following code in the ``article.js`` to show the individual header image as a background image at the top of the article: \n\n```html\n<% if (!index && post.photograph){ %>\n<style>\n  #banner {\n    background-size: cover;\n  }\n  @media screen and (max-width: 479px) {\n    #banner { background-image:\n      linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.75) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 75%),\n      url(\"/photos/mobile/<%= post.photograph.file %>\"); }\n  }\n  @media screen and (min-width: 480px) and (max-width: 767px) {\n    #banner { background-image: \n      linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.75) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 75%),\n      url(\"/photos/tablet/<%= post.photograph.file %>\"); }\n  }\n  @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {\n    #banner { background-image: \n      linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.75) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 75%),\n      url(\"/photos/normal/<%= post.photograph.file %>\"); }\n  }\n</style>\n<script>\n  var photoLink = document.getElementById(\"header-photo-link\");\n  photoLink.href = \"<%= post.photograph.link%>\";\n  photoLink.innerHTML = \"see <strong><%= post.photograph.name%></strong> at 500px\";\n</script>\n<% } %>\n```\n\nImportant part here is the use of the Frontmatter data ``post.photograph.file`` in the URL of the background CSS. The script fills the additional information into the absolute positioned element ``header-photo-link`` which is placed on top of the header.\n\n## Pooling Images\n\nAs it is time consuming to generate the necessary images, I have created another static folder ``pool`` to store prepared files and a text file with the additional information about the image. The structure of ``pool`` is different to ``photos``, because of my image workflow and some limitations of automating the provisioning.\n\n```txt\n| static/\n   | pool/\n      | my-lovely-picture/\n         | meta.txt\n         | mobile.jpg\n         | normal.jpg\n         | tablet.jpg\n      | ...\n```\nThe ``meta.txt`` is a simple text file with two lines of text: first the name of the image and second the Url to link to, which will be inserted in the appropriate Frontmatter fields on creating a new post:\n\n```txt\nMy Lovely Image\nhttps://500px.com/photo/123456789/My-Lovely-Image\n```\n\n## Automate binding and provisioning on new post\n\nDevelopers are lazy and I do not make an exception. Having all these pool images and the meta informations, it would be nice, if Hexo just picks and processes one of the pool folders automatically, when I'm creating a new post by calling ``hexo new \"My shiny new post\"`` ... and it was easier then I thought.\n\n### Where to place the code for the automatism\n\nHexo has a great [API](https://hexo.io/api/) to write [plugins](https://hexo.io/plugins/) and it is not very difficult to setup a new plugin for this, which can be published to the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=hexo). But it is also possible to extend Hexo's functionality by using a simple script. All you need is a **``script``** folder in the root of your Hexo project. Any JS files which is placed there, will be executed by Hexo.\n\nTherefore, lets use a script called ``\\scripts\\process-photo-on-new.js`` ...\n\n### Things an automatism should do - Step by Step\n\n1. Hook into the creation of a post\n2. Pick randomly one of the pool images\n3. Place the content of the meta.txt in the Frontmatter\n4. Move the 3 device-dependend images into the ``photos`` folder\n\n#### Step 1 - Hook into the creation of a post\n\nThe needed event, the automatism can hook on, is:\n\n```javascript\nhexo.on('new', function(data){\n  //\n});\n```\n\nIt will be executed every time you call the ``hexo new`` command. The parameter ``data`` is an object with two fields:\n\n* ``path``  \nFull path to the MD file of the new post\n\n* ``content``  \nComplete content of the scaffold (template), which Hexo has used to create the new post; default is ``/scaffolds/post.md``.\n\nBy preloading the Hexo Front matter library and parsing ``data.content`` we get access to the definition of the new post:\n\n```javascript\nconst front = require('hexo-front-matter');\n\nhexo.on('new', function(post){\n\n  // parse article content\n  var post = front.parse(data.content);\n});\n```\n\n#### Step 2 - Pick randomly one of the pool images\n\nThere are some build-in variables to get the full path, for example, of the ``source`` folder, we can use to define the needed paths to the ``pool`` and the ``photo`` folder.\n\n```javascript\nconst front = require('hexo-front-matter');\n\nhexo.on('new', function(post){\n  var post = front.parse(data.content);\n\n  // set the path variables\n  var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"pool\";\n  var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"photos\";\n});\n```\n\nNext, we need to preload the Hexo FS library for file access, to list the content of the ``poolDir``, including the subfolders, and filter out the meta files. Out of the resulting array we pick one randomly, to use for the new post:\n\n```javascript\nconst front = require('hexo-front-matter');\nconst fs = require('hexo-fs');\n\nhexo.on('new', function(post){\n  var post = front.parse(data.content);\n\n  var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"pool\";\n  var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"photos\";\n\n  // list all files\n  var files = fs.listDirSync(poolDir);\n\n  // filter the list to get meta files of each subfolder\n  var metaFiles = files.filter(file => file.match(/.*[\\\\]meta.txt/g));\n\n  // pick one randomly\n  var metaFile = metaFiles[Math.floor(Math.random() * metaFiles.length)];\n\n  // get the name of the picked photo (foldername)\n  var photoName = metaFile.split(\"\\\\\")[0];\n});\n```\n\n#### Step 3 - Place the content of the meta.txt in the Frontmatter\n\nNow we have to read the meta file, place the data in the Frontmatter and save the article file:\n\n```javascript\nconst front = require('hexo-front-matter');\nconst fs = require('hexo-fs');\n\nhexo.on('new', function(post){\n  var post = front.parse(data.content);\n\n  var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"pool\";\n  var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"photos\";\n  \n  var files = fs.listDirSync(poolDir);\n  var metaFiles = files.filter(file => file.match(/.*[\\\\]meta.txt/g));\n  var metaFile = metaFiles[Math.floor(Math.random() * metaFiles.length)];\n  var photoName = metaFile.split(\"\\\\\")[0];\n\n  // read meta file\n  var meta = fs.readFileSync(poolDir + \"\\\\\" + metaFile);\n  var metas = meta.split(\"\\n\");\n\n  // place file and additional info in the Frontmatter\n  post.photograph.file = photoName + \".jpg\";\n  post.photograph.name = metas[0];\n  post.photograph.link = metas[1];\n\n  // convert content back\n  postStr = front.stringify(post);\n  postStr = '---\\n' + postStr;\n\n  // store article\n  fs.writeFile(data.path, postStr, 'utf-8');\n});\n```\n\n#### Step 4 - Move the 3 device-dependend images into the photos folder\n\nLast but not least, we have to move the pool images into the ``photos`` folder and remove the pool folder with all its processed content:\n\n```javascript\nconst front = require('hexo-front-matter');\nconst fs = require('hexo-fs');\n\nhexo.on('new', function(post){\n  var post = front.parse(data.content);\n\n  var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"pool\";\n  var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(\"\\source\", hexo.config.static_dir) + \"photos\";\n  \n  var files = fs.listDirSync(poolDir);\n  var metaFiles = files.filter(file => file.match(/.*[\\\\]meta.txt/g));\n  var metaFile = metaFiles[Math.floor(Math.random() * metaFiles.length)];\n  var photoName = metaFile.split(\"\\\\\")[0];\n\n  var meta = fs.readFileSync(poolDir + \"\\\\\" + metaFile);\n  var metas = meta.split(\"\\n\");\n\n  post.photograph.file = photoName + \".jpg\";\n  post.photograph.name = metas[0];\n  post.photograph.link = metas[1];\n\n  postStr = front.stringify(post);\n  postStr = '---\\n' + postStr;\n\n  fs.writeFile(data.path, postStr, 'utf-8');\n\n  //copy normal image\n  fs.copyFile(\n    poolDir + \"\\\\\" + photoName + \"\\\\normal.jpg\",\n    photosDir + \"\\\\normal\\\\\" + photoName + \".jpg\",\n    function() {\n\n      //copy tablet image\n      fs.copyFile(\n        poolDir + \"\\\\\" + photoName + \"\\\\tablet.jpg\",\n        photosDir + \"\\\\tablet\\\\\" + photoName + \".jpg\",\n        function() {\n\n          //copy mobile image\n          fs.copyFile(\n            poolDir + \"\\\\\" + photoName + \"\\\\mobile.jpg\",\n            photosDir + \"\\\\mobile\\\\\" + photoName + \".jpg\",\n            function() {\n\n              //remove processed pool folder\n              fs.rmdirSync(poolDir + \"\\\\\" + photoName);\n            });\n        });\n    });\n\n});\n```\n\nNow it so easy to write a new post, because almost everything is set and I can concentrate on the article. Also, it is a nice surprise to see, which photo the script has chosen. The only thing I have to do from time to time, is to refill the pool folder with new images.\n","tags":["Hexo","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Localization with resource files in JavaScript web apps","url":"/post/Localization-with-resource-files-in-JavaScript-web-apps/","content":"\nThere are plenty of editors out there to help you writing JavaScript web applications. As I'm working in my daily life with Visual Studio, it is a obvious choice for me.\n\nOne of the most time saving tools in VS is the plugin [ResXManager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomEnglert.ResXManager), which is an awesome assistant on managing the translations for a Desktop- or ASP.NET-App, which uses XML-based RESX files.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nMostly very localization is based on key/value pairs, defined in separate files for every language provided.\n\nImplementing several languages in pure JavaScript apps is a little more difficult, because it makes no sense to deal with big XML files in JS. All localization libraries in the market uses JSON for storing the translations and it is a little bit of work to find the right one for your requirements.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Localization in JavaScript\n\nFor a current project I use  [jquery-lang](https://github.com/Irrelon/jquery-lang-js), because it provides the switch of the apps UI language without reloading and it is easy to implement. Thanks Rob Evans for your work...\n\nThe definition of \"tokens\" in one JSON file for each language is quite easy:\n\n```js ../languages/en.json\n{\n    \"token\": {\n        \"my-test\": \"My Test in English\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```js ../languages/de.json\n{\n    \"token\": {\n        \"my-test\": \"Mein Test in Deutsch\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe usage also:\n```html\n<div lang=\"en\" data-lang-token=\"my-test\">\n```\n\n## Using RESX and convert to JSON on build\n\nHaving this, the most time consuming work is to enter the translations to the localization files. If you have hundreds of them, it is hard to keep the 2, 3 or more language files in sync. You need a helper...\n\nAnd here comes ResXManager to the rescue, if you work with VS ... but it needs a conversation from RESX to the JSON format jquery-lang uses and this a task, which can be done on building the JS app, by using a task runner like [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/).\n\nAs there was no Grunt plugin/task out there to fit my needs, I have created  **grunt-resource2json** ([GitHub](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/grunt-resource2json), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-resource2json)). The configuration in the **gruntfile.js** is like: \n\n```json gruntfile.js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n    resource2json: {\n      convert: {\n        options: {\n          format: \"jquery-lang\"\n        },\n        files: [\n          {\n            input: \"resources/Resource.resx\",\n            output: \"build/langpacks/en.json\"\n          },\n          {\n            input: \"resources/Resource.de-DE.resx\",\n            output: \"build/langpacks/de.json\"\n          },\n          {\n            input: \"resources/Resource.es-ES.resx\",\n            output: \"build/langpacks/es.json\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    });\n```\n\nIt takes one RESX file (input) and converts it to a JSON file (output) in an array of files.\n\nThe heavy work in the plugin is done by the library [xml2js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js), which transforms the complete XML of the RESX file into a JSON object in one call. All I had to do, was to write all DATA nodes in a loop into the jquery-lang given structure and save it as JSON.\n\nCurrently supported is the format for jquery-lang only, but it would be awesome, if you fork the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/grunt-resource2json) and send me a Pull Request with the implementation of your needed format.\n","tags":["GitHub","Visual Studio","Resource","Localization"],"categories":["JavaScript"]},{"title":"TFS/DevOps: Delete Remote Workspace","url":"/post/TFS-DevOps-Delete-Remote-Workspace/","content":"\nIf you are working with freelance developers and Azure DevOps/TFS with TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control) in your company, maybe this will look familiar to you: You hire a new freelancer and you want to reuse the hardware, including the complete software setup, to bring him/her to work as fast and straightforward as possible. You set up a new Azure Devops account with all necessary permissions and you think you're done. No you are not...\n<!-- more -->\n\nEverytime a user connects to a Team Project on Azure DevOps via Visual Studio and gets the code, VS is creating a **remote workspace** on the server, with the **machine name** as default, therefor it is not enough to wipe the profile and any other legacies of the last user from the machine. You also have to remove the remote workspace. Otherwise you will get an error message like that, if you are using a unique file structure on the developers hard disc:\n\n```txt\nThe working folder c://xxx is already in use by the workspace yyy;zzz on computer yyy\n```\n\nThe variable xxx stands for the blocked folder, yyy for the workspace/machine name and zzz for the users id on Azure DevOps.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no visual management console on Azure DevOps to manage your server workspaces, but there is a command line tool called **[tf.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/use-team-foundation-version-control-commands?view=azure-devops)**.\n\nThe easiest way to get rid of the unused server workspace in 3 steps:\n\n## Step 1\n\nRun **Developer Command Prompt** with Administrator privileges from Visual Studio 2019 and login with your Azure DevOps credentials. If the Login dialog doesn't show up, force it by executing:\n\n```txt\ntf.exe workspace\n```\n\n## Step 2\n\nGet a list of all remote workspaces available in your DevOps Collection by running the command:\n\n```txt\ntf.exe workspaces /computer:* /owner:* /format:xml > c:\\temp\\workspaces.xml\n```\n\nYou can get a list of all your workspaces by running ``tf workspaces``, but the list only shows you the ``owner``, but not the necessary ``ownerid`` and ... it is nicer to have a file to search in.\n\n## Step 3\n\nFind the abandoned workspace in the list and note its ``name`` and  ``ownerid`` for running the command:\n\n```txt\ntf workspace /delete {WORKSPACE.name};{WORKSPACE.ownerid}\n```\n\nNow your new colleague can create his own workspace on the same machine.\n\n## Update\nIn case you want to switch your own DevOps account to another and use the same folder as before, you can certainly delete the local workspace, but this wont help, because you are still logged in at TeamExplorer and the folder knows to whom it belongs. Solution is easy:\n\n1. Quit Visual Studio\n2. Rename folder in ``***_OLD`` or something\n3. Create new folder with the same name\n4. Enter ``C:\\Users\\YOUR-NAME\\appdata\\Local\\Microsoft\\Team Foundation\\VS-VERSION\\Cache`` and emtpy the folder to let Visual Studio forget who you are\n5.

Instead of implementing the media query directly into my CSS (or Stylus) code, I used a root selector, which can be manipulated by JavaScript ... something like this:\n\n```css\nbody {\n    background-color: white;\n    color: black;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] body {\n    background-color: black;\n    color: white;\n  }\n}\n```\n<!-- more -->\n\nIn every Stylus file, where I used ``@media prefers-dark`` to achieve the automatic switch by the OS, I changed this line into ``/[data-theme=\"dark\"] &`` :\n\n```styl\n#mobile-nav-header\n  background-color: color-background\n  /[data-theme=\"dark\"] &\n    background-color: dark-color-background\n  img.avatar\n    ...\n    /[data-theme=\"dark\"] &\n      filter: brightness(85%)\n```\n\nSome explanations on the [Stylus syntax](http://stylus-lang.com/docs/selectors.html): ``/`` means the root of the DOM and ``&`` points to the parent selector. Therefore the example will be rendered into this:\n\n```css\n#mobile-nav-header {\n    background-color: #f1f1f1;\n}\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] #mobile-nav-header {\n    background-color: #111;\n}\n\n#mobile-nav-header img.avatar {\n...\n}\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] #mobile-nav-header img.avatar\n    filter: brightness(85%);\n}\n```\n\nOnly problem was: the \"Root + Parent\" Stylus selector doesn't work in the block variables in the ``_extend.styl``. So I had to copy all theme relevant styles directly to the elements, where such a block was used: ``@extend <block-name>``.\n\n## The Toggle Switch\n\nIn the ``footer.ejs`` I added a toggle checkbox, where I could bind my JavaScript...\n\n```html\n<div id=\"footer-theme\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"theme-switch\">\n    <label for=\"theme-switch\"></label>\n</div>\n```\n\n... and some CSS in the ``footer.styl``, to style it:\n\n```styl\ninput#theme-switch[type=checkbox] {\n  display:none;\n}\n\ninput#theme-switch[type=checkbox] + label\n  height: 16px\n  width: 16px\n  display: inline-block\n  padding: 12px\n  font-size: 22px\n  cursor: pointer\n  &:before\n    display: inline-block\n    font-size: inherit\n    text-rendering: auto\n    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased\n    font-family: fa-icon-solid\n    content: icon-moon\n\ninput#theme-switch[type=checkbox]:checked + label\n  &:before\n    content: icon-sun\n```\n\nThe ``icon`` variables are defined in the ``_variables.styl`` like this:\n\n```styl\nicon-moon = \"\\f186\"\nicon-sun = \"\\f185\"\n```\n\n## The JavaScript\n\nEverything was now prepared to implement the switching code in JavaScript, which should support a manual switch by clicking the toggle element as well as the automatic switch by the OS.\n\nI wrapped all necessary code into a seperate JS file and placed a reference in the ``after-footer.ejs``, which places it at the bottom of the HTML:\n\n```ejs\n<%- js('js/dark-mode-toggle.js') %>\n```\n\n```js\nfunction detectColorScheme() {\n    var theme = \"light\"; //default\n\n    // get last used theme from local cache\n    if(localStorage.getItem(\"theme\")){\n        if(localStorage.getItem(\"theme\") === \"dark\"){\n            theme = \"dark\";\n        }\n    } else if(!window.matchMedia) { \n        // matchMedia not supported  \n        return false;\n    } else if(window.matchMedia(\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\").matches) {\n        // OS has set Dark Mode\n        theme = \"dark\";\n    }\n\n    // set detected theme\n    if (theme === \"dark\") {\n        setThemeDark();\n    } else {\n        setThemeLight();\n    }\n}\n\nconst toggleTheme = document.querySelector('input#theme-switch[type=\"checkbox\"]');\n\nfunction setThemeDark() {\n    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');\n    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark');\n    toggleTheme.checked = true;\n}\nfunction setThemeLight() {\n    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light');\n    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light');\n    toggleTheme.checked = false;\n}\n\n// Listener for theme change by toggle\ntoggleTheme.addEventListener('change', function(e) {\n    if (e.target.checked) {\n        setThemeDark();\n    } else {\n        setThemeLight();\n    }\n}, false);\n\n// Listener for theme change by OS\nvar toggleOS = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');\ntoggleOS.addEventListener('change', function (e) {\n    if (e.matches) {\n        setThemeDark();\n    } else {\n        setThemeLight();\n    }\n});\n\n// call theme detection\ndetectColorScheme();\n```\n\nBy using the both ``addEventListener``'s, each switch will be recognized and this approach is capable to support even more themes, just by using different values in the ``data-theme`` attribute.\n","tags":["Hexo","CSS","Stylus","Dark Mode"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"Hexo and the Dark Mode","url":"/post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode/","content":"\nDue to the fact, that nowadays everybody is talking about Dark Modes for Browsers and Operating Systems, in order to save battery or for easier reading (uhh, really?), I decided my blog should support that.\n\n![Switching Dark Mode in Windows 10](Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode/screen-recording-1.gif)\n<!-- more -->\n\nStarting point is the new media query ``prefers-color-scheme``, which is actually supported by all modern browsers.\n\n## Technique\n\nMy first read was Tom Brow's [Dark mode in a website with CSS](https://tombrow.com/dark-mode-website-css), where he shows how to use the media query. Simplified, this is it, assuming the light version is the default:\n\n```css\nbody {\n    background-color: white;\n    color: black;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  body {\n    background-color: black;\n    color: white;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Pimping CSS for automatic switching\n\nTo support the automatic browser/OS-based automatic switch in Hexo, where [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) is used, I had to change some template files. First the ``_variables.styl``:\n\n```styl\n// existing color variables\ncolor-background = #f1f1f1\ncolor-foreground = #111\ncolor-border = #ddd\n...\n\n// new dark color variables\ndark-color-background = #111\ndark-color-foreground = #eee\ndark-color-border = #000\n...\n\n// new media query variable\nprefers-dark = \"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\n```\n\nNext step was to change the ``_extend.styl``, where some Stylus variables are defining complete blocks to extend. Here I had to supplement all lines, where something mode-dependend was defined, by adding the new ``prefers-dark`` media query and beneath the new 'dark' equivalence of the style:\n\n```styl\n$base-style\n  hr\n    ...\n    border: 1px dashed color-border-article\n    @media prefers-dark\n      border: 1px dashed dark-color-border-article\n    ...\n\n$block\n  ...\n  background: color-block\n  box-shadow: 1px 2px 3px color-border\n  border: 1px solid color-border\n  @media prefers-dark\n    background: dark-color-block\n    box-shadow: 1px 2px 3px dark-color-border\n    border-color: dark-color-border\n\n...\n```\n\nThe same changes I had to do in every template ``styl`` file, where one of the colors or other mode dependent style was used. For example:\n\n```styl\n#mobile-nav-header\n  background-color: color-background\n  @media prefers-dark\n    background-color: dark-color-background\n  img.avatar\n    ...\n    @media prefers-dark\n      filter: brightness(85%)\n```\n\nThis will be rendered as:\n\n```css\n  #mobile-nav-header {\n    background-color: #f1f1f1;\n  }\n  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n      #mobile-nav-header {\n      background-color: #111;\n    }\n  }\n\n  #mobile-nav-header img.avatar {\n    ...\n  }\n  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n    filter: brightness(85%);\n  }\n```\n\nPlease note the use of ``filter:brightness()`` in the example. It is always advisable to darken the images too, because they can really pop out on dark backgrounds.\n","tags":["Hexo","CSS","Stylus","Dark Mode"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"A New Blog: Blogging and Synching en route","url":"/post/A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/","content":"\nI work with several devices, some Windows, some Android, and sometimes I have time to write on my articles at home (Notebook, Tablet), in my spare time in the office (Desktop, Laptop) or on my way to somewhere (Smartphone). Right now I'm am in a barber shop, waiting for my haircut and write these lines. So, wherever I am, I need the Hexo project locally, but in sync on a digital device.\n\nThe blog is synced via Dropbox, but hosted on GitHub Pages, so on every device I need the  publishing functions of Git too.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Sync Hexo Project\n\nBest option for me to achieve this was  [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com). Another benefit on that is: I can work on the structure of the blog wherever I am and commit when the new feature or improvement is done, because all Git related files are always in sync too.\n\n## Writing, Editing and Publishing on Windows\n\nMy preferred editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Good file handling, easy writing, full Git integration and tons of other plugins and helpers. Chapeau Microsoft, well done.\n\nSome of the following VS Code plugins makes working with Hexo on GitHub pages a breeze:\n\n---\n\n[![vscode-hexo](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/icon-vscode-hexo.png)]((https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codeyu.vscode-hexo){.lefty})  \nAdds Hexo commands like ``init``, ``new``, ``generate``, ``server`` and ``clean`` to the VS Code command palette.\n\n---\n\n[![Markdown All in One](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/icon-markdown-all-in-one.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)  \nKeyboard shortcuts for basic formatting, automatic list editing, autocomlete for images,  table formatter and much more for an easier handling of Markdown.\n\n---\n\n[![markdownlint](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/icon-markdownlint.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)  \nMarkdown linting and style checking\n\n---\n\n[![Language Stylus](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/icon-stylus.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sysoev.language-stylus)  \nAdds syntax highlighting and code completion to Stylus files\n\n---\n\n[![GitLens](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/icon-gitlens.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sysoev.language-stylus)  \nComplete visual management of your repositories in VS Code\n\n---\n\n[![Git Graph](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/icon-gitgraph.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)  \nView a Git Graph of your repository with all changes and manage commits.\n\n---\n\nWith this editor and its helpers, I'm just two clicks away from publishing a new article or even a new version of the Hexo blog itself.\n\n## Writing on Android\n\nThere are a lot of Markdown editors available on Google Play, but one is outstanding: [iA Writer for Android](https://ia.net/writer/support/android). I can open my posts or drafts directly from Dropbox, without the need of any sychronization. Open, write, close, done.\n\n![iA Writer Android](A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/ia-writer-1.png)\n\n## Publishing on Android\n\nThere are some Git related Android apps out there, but no solution was satisfying. Furthermore, I didn't really need Git here, because I didn't want to have all source files on my smartphone. I'm working directly on the Dropbox stored MD files via iA Writer. Finally and most important, Git won't be enough, because before publishing, I have to run ``hexo generate``! Therefore some sort of automatic transfer from Dropbox to GitHub is also out of the game.\n\nWhat I needed, was to tell a server at a certain point of time 'Hey, please publish for me', using the only connection I have: Dropbox.\n\n### Introducing a Demon\n\nI have a little media server, running on Windows, and he is synchronizing some folders with Dropbox. He could do the job! After I installed all necessary packages, like NodeJS, Hexo and Git, I included the project folder into the sync. \n\nNext step was to design a so called **Hexo Command File**, a simple TXT file, which holds commands in single lines, extended with execution times, when they were successfully running.\n\n```properties\npostdraft: A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route\npublish\nnewdraft: \"A New Blog: Blogging and Synching en route\" @ 2019-09-30 21:15\nregenerate @ 2019-09-29 16:40:01\npublish @ 2019-09-29 16:40:10\n```\n\nThese commands are predefined, because they bundle several real commands and I didn't want to deal with real commands, due to security reasons.\n\nThe unprocessed commands are standing at the top of the file (in execution order!) and parameters are separated from the command by a colon and delimited by commas.\n\n    <command>: [<param1>, ...] @ <execution time>\n\nNext step was to create a program to work as an executing demon, who monitors the Hexo Command File (synced by Dropbox) on my server and executes commands without execution dates.\n\nI decided to create a simple Console Application in C# and use the built-in [Windows Task Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler) for running it every 2 minutes. The application is called **HexoCommander** and is [available at GitHub](https://github.com/kristofzerbe/HexoCommander).\n\nIt expects the Hexo Command File to be named ``hexo-commands.txt``, located in the same folder, and provides the following commands:\n\n**newdraft: \"&lt;title&gt;\"** ... runs\n\n1. ``hexo new draft \"<title>\"``\n\nCreates a new draft.\n\n**postdraft: \"&lt;filename without extension&gt;\"** ... runs\n\n1. ``hexo publish \"<filename without extension>\"``\n\nMakes a post out of a draft.\n\n**regenerate** ... runs\n\n1. ``hexo clean``\n2. ``hexo generate``\n\nWipes all Hexo static pages and generates them new.\n\n**publish** ... runs\n\n1. ``hexo generate``\n2. ``git add \"source/*\" \"docs/*\"``\n3. ``git commit -m \"Remote publication via HexoCommander\"``\n4. ``git push origin master``\n\nGenerates Hexo static pages, stage changes on drafts, posts and static pages, commits the changes with a generic message and pushes them to the server.\n\n### Running the demon\n\nI would have never expected, that the trickiest part was to get HexoCommander running via Windows Task Scheduler. What a mess! I finally find the solution [here](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/SqlServer/en-US/29446adf-8304-4b9f-bbc4-95daf2941d53/program-runs-fine-but-task-scheduler-wont-run-it?forum=winserver2008appcompatabilityandcertification):\n\n1. Compile HexoCommander in a **x86** configuration\n\n2. Create a new task in Task Scheduler with\n   * **Trigger**\n     * Dialy\n     * Recur every 1 days\n     * Repeat task every 2 minutes for a duration of 1 day\n   * **Action**\n     * Program/Script: **%systemroot%\\Syswow64\\cmd.exe**\n     * Add Arguments: **/C \"C:\\MyPath\\HexoCommander.exe /workdir=C:\\MyPath\"**\n     * Start In: **%systemroot%\\Syswow64\\\\**\n\nBecause some executing commands in the chain are NOT 64-bit, I had to force Task Scheduler to run the 32-bit Command Shell in its own path (see 'Start In' and don't forget the closing backslash) and take the 32-bit compiled HexoCommander as argument after the parameter ```/C``` (forcing command to terminate), including its own argument for defining the real working directory. Mind bending, but works...\n","tags":["VS Code","Hexo","GitHub","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"A New Blog: Customizing Hexo","url":"/post/A-New-Blog-Customizing-Hexo/","content":"\nHexo is a great tool to get quick results (see [Part One of this series](/categories/Tools/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/)), when you decide to have a blog and its defaults are practical, but it's power lies in the possiblities of customization via plugins. On the [official plugin page](https://hexo.io/plugins/index.html), there are actually 302 plugins listed, but there are many more and no wish will be unsatisfied.\n\nI will show you which of these I found worth to work with...\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Relative Image Path\n\nThe build-in way to include images in your posts works fine, but it is a little aside the normal way to declare images in Markdown. The plugin [Hexo Asset Link] corrects that. After installing via ``npm install hexo-asset-link --save`` you can write this:\n\n    ![Test Image](hello-world/image-1.png)\n\nThe best is, that VS Code's Markdown can now show the image.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE**:  \nActually the plugin [destroys external links](https://github.com/liolok/hexo-asset-link/issues/3), so don't use it until this is fixed ... or go to **node_modules** &gt; **hexo-asset-link** &gt; **index.js** in your project and change in line 22 ``protocal`` to ``protocol``.\n\n**UPDATE from Update**:  \n[liolok](https://github.com/liolok), the author of the plugin has merged my pull request and published a new new version without the typo. It works now as expected.\n\n---\n\n## Hide Posts\n\nA new Hexo project comes with a sample post called ``Hello World``. This is fine to play around with, but you don't want to publish it. Here comes a Hexo plugin to the rescue called [Hexo Hide Posts](https://github.com/printempw/hexo-hide-posts). After installing, you just have to write ``hidden: true`` to the Front Matter of you post and it won't be shown on the blog, but it is still available by URL.\n\n## Static Files\n\nHexo has the concept of [Assets Folders](https://hexo.io/docs/asset-folders), but for static files, beside article based files, I find it more useful to have a STATIC folder and copy the contents on every build into the publish folder. A good helper for this approach is the plugin [Hexo Generator Copy](https://github.com/niahoo/hexo-generator-copy). Install it by running ``npm install hexo-generator-copy --save`` and add ``static_dir: static`` to your ``_config.yml`` and you are done.\n\n    ![Hexo Static Files](A-New-Blog-Customizing-Hexo/vscode-1.png)\n\n## Feed\n\nThe default Hexo layout has an Atom Feed icon in the upper right corner, but strangely no feed file is generated on build. You need to install the plugin [Hexo Feed Generator](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed) to fix this, by running ``npm install hexo-generator-feed --save`` and copy following section into the ``_config.yml``:\n\n```yaml\nfeed:\n    type: atom\n    path: atom.xml\n    limit: 20\n    hub:\n    content:\n    content_limit: 140\n    content_limit_delim: ' '\n    order_by: -date\n```\n\n## Manifest for PWA\n\nIn these modern times it's always a good idea, that your blog feels like an App. For this you need a manifest file (JSON) an several icons (PNG). You can generate these files very fast with the [Web App Manifest Generator](https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com) and store it in your static folder.\n\nTo bind this file into your blog, you can use the plugin [Hexo PWA](https://github.com/lavas-project/hexo-pwa). Run ``npm install --save hexo-pwa`` and copy following section to your ``_config.yml``, where you take the settings from your generated manifest file:\n\n```yaml\npwa:\n    manifest:\n        path: /manifest.json\n        body:\n        name: myblog.de\n        short_name: My Blog\n        icons:\n            - src: /images/icon-192x192.png\n            sizes: 192x192\n            type: image/png\n            - src: /images/icon-512x512.png\n            sizes: 512x512\n            type: image/png\n        start_url: /index.html\n        theme_color: '#025ab1'\n        background_color: '#dddddd'\n        display: standalone\n```\n\n## Sitemap File\n\nTo help [Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668) and others a bit to index your blog, it is advisable to provide a sitemap file. Here comes [Hexo Generator Sitemap](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap) to the rescue. Install it by running the command ``npm install hexo-generator-sitemap --save``. You can configure it via ``_config.yml``:\n\n```yaml\nsitemap:\n    path: sitemap.xml\n    template: ./sitemap-template.xml\n```\n\nThe plugin installation doesn't create the needed ``sitemap-template`` file, so be sure you grab a copy from the plugins repository: [https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap/blob/master/sitemap.xml](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap/blob/master/sitemap.xml)\n\n## Commenting\n\nHexo doesn't have a commenting system, but it's prepared to stick [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments under each article. Just create a new Disqus account for your blog and note the given short name. By adding following section to the ``_config.yml`` Hexo shows the commenting section:\n\n```yaml\ndisqus_enabled: true\ndisqus_shortname: my-blog\n```\n\n## Inifinite Scroll\n\nHexo shows as much articles at the start page as configured in ``_config.yml`` under ``index_generator.per_page``, but it's nicer to load more articles as you scroll by using the Hexo script [Inifinite Scroll](https://github.com/FrontendSophie/hexo-infinite-scroll). Install by adding following little script in **themes** & gt; **layout** &gt; **_partial** &gt; **after-footer.ejs**\n\n```html\n<script src=\"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/frontendsophie/hexo-infinite-scroll@2.0.0/dist/main.js\"></script> \n<script>\n    infiniteScroll({\n    showNum: 5,\n    style: 'line-scale',\n    color: '#025ab1'\n    })\n</script>\n```\n\n## Back To Top\n\nIts nice to support the reader on scolling by providing a Scroll-To-Top button. The easiest way to get this, is the script [Vanilla Back To Top](https://github.com/vfeskov/vanilla-back-to-top). Just add follwing to **themes** &gt;**layout** &gt; **_partial** &gt; **after-footer.ejs**:\n\n```html\n<script>addBackToTop({\n    diameter: 30,\n    backgroundColor: 'rgb(0, 90, 180)',\n    textColor: '#fff'\n})\n</script>\n<style>\n#back-to-top {\n    border-radius: 0;\n    opacity: 0.6;\n}\n#back-to-top:hover {\n    opacity: 1;\n}\n</style>\n```\n","tags":["VS Code","Hexo","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"A New Blog: VS Code, Hexo and GitHub Pages","url":"/post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","content":"\nA few days ago I puzzled over a technical problem regarding SQL Server, Active Directory and Visual Studio Database Projects. With tips, hints and snippets from several websites I got it running and the solution was absolutely memorable. For myself and for others. Nothing is harder than to know 'you did this before...', but not to remember how.\n\nBecause of this strong leaning towards oblivion, I started over 20 years ago my very first website **zerbit.de**, manually crafted with Classic ASP and a SQL Server database as backend, with an editor, tagging, categories and so on. It was really exciting to build this blog from scratch and writing articles for it, but it was so time consuming to expand the features of the website and keep it running, that some day I quit it silently.\n\nSo, to document the solution mentioned above, I could use tools like OneNote or others, like in the past years, but this would be just for me and not for all developers, who have a similar problem.

The title will be converted in a URL-encoded string and will be used as file name and url.\n\n### Meta data\nEvery post/draft starts with its header (so called [Front Matter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter)) to store some meta data, which describes the post, like ``title``, ``date``, ``tags`` or ``categories``. This is used by Hexo to classify and arrange your post during the build.\n\n### Markdown\nHexo posts/drafts are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Good syntax reference are the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and the more detailed [Markdown Syntax Guide](https://sourceforge.net/p/hexo/wiki/markdown_syntax/).\n\n### Excerpt\nIs is usual to show a short excerpt an the start page of a blog, to keep it compact and teasering the user to click on a READ MORE button. To achieve this, you just have to add following comment to your article. Everything above is the excerpt and everything below is only shown, when you enter the article:\n\n    <!-- more -->\n\n### Images\n\nSome articles will contain images to illustrate something and the question is, where should they be stored? Answer: In a folder beside the post/draft, which has the same name as the article MD file. To get this, you have to activate the setting ``post_asset_folder`` in your ``_config.yml``. Now this folder will be created automatically, when you add a new post/draft.\n\nIn your Markdown you reference your image with:\n\n    {% asset_img image-1.png \"Test Image\" %}\n\n![Reference Image](A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/vscode-2.png)\n\n## Build\n\nHexo is a website generator, so a build will generate the whole website in a special folder, which has to be published. This output folder can be configured in the ``_config.yml``:\n\n    public_dir: public\n\nTo wipe the output folder, run the command:\n\n    hexo clean\n\nTo start the build, run:\n\n    hexo generate\n\nTo view the website via the build-in local Hexo server, run:\n\n    hexo server\n\n## Publishing\n\nMost \"complex\" task was to publish the new blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). My first approach was to use my personal page, as I did with my single HTML file, but this didn't work, because I wanted to store the whole project on GitHub and it is not possible to point a personal page to the subdirectory **docs** or use a different branch as **master**.\n\nThe simple solution was to create a new repository, named after my my blog **kiko.io**, to store teh whole project and point the GitHub Page to the subdirectory **docs** in the settings of the repository.\n\n![GitHub Settings](A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/github-1.png)\n\nBy overriding the default publish folder of Hexo in ``_config.yml`` ...\n\n    public_dir: docs\n\n... everything was set up. Commit and Push via git and done.\n\nHexo has its own deploying mechanism and it is advisable to disable it, by commenting out the Deployment section ``_config.yml``.\n\nNext step was to use my own custom domain for the blog. To achieve this, the most easiest way is to create a text file named ``CNAME`` (without extension!) with the content of the domain in a single line and publish this file in the root of the docs folder. Github will recognize this file and do the setup automatically.\n\nTo point the domain to GitHub, I had to create following ``A`` records in my domain providers DNS settings:\n\n* 185.199.108.153\n* 185.199.109.153\n* 185.199.110.153\n* 185.199.111.153\n\nLast step was to enable **Enforce HTTPS** in the repositories settings.\n","tags":["VS Code","Hexo","GitHub","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"How-To: Visual Studio Database Project and ADSI","url":"/post/How-To-Visual-Studio-Database-Project-and-ADSI/","content":"If you are working with a Visual Studio Database Project and have to deal with data from the Active Directory via a Linked Server, you have to announce the data structure of the AD data in order to get the project compiled.\n<!-- more -->\n## Step 1 - Linking to the Active Directory\n\nFirst of all you have to connect your SQL Server to the AD permanently, by running  following SQL script once on your SQL Server:\n\n    USE [master]\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedserver @server = N'ADSI', \n        @srvproduct=N'Active Directory Service Interfaces', \n        @provider=N'ADSDSOObject', \n        @datasrc=N'adsdatasource'\n    \n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedsrvlogin @rmtsrvname=N'ADSI',\n        @useself=N'False',\n        @locallogin=NULL,\n        @rmtuser=N'mydomain\\myadminuser',\n        @rmtpassword='mypassword'\n    GO\n    \n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'collation compatible', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'data access', @optvalue=N'true'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'dist', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'pub', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'rpc', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'rpc out', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'sub', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'connect timeout', @optvalue=N'0'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'collation name', @optvalue=null\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'lazy schema validation', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'query timeout', @optvalue=N'0'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'use remote collation', @optvalue=N'true'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'remote proc transaction promotion', @optvalue=N'true'\n    GO\n\n## Step 2 - Fetching ADSI data  \n\nTo get data, use ``OpenQuery`` against the Linked Server. In order to get only persons and no system accounts, you should filter out all users, which has no firstname (``givenName``) or lastname (``sn``):\n\n    SELECT \n        UserPrincipalName, \n        DisplayName, \n        sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName], \n        sn AS [LastName], \n        givenName AS [FirstName], \n        title AS [Title], \n        Mail as [MailAddress],\n        department AS [Department],\n        l AS [Location], \n        postalCode AS [PostCode], \n        streetAddress AS [Street],\n        st AS [State]\n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '\n        SELECT \n            UserPrincipalName, \n            DisplayName, \n            sAMAccountName, \n            sn, \n            givenName, \n            department,\n            title, \n            Mail, \n            l, \n            postalCode, \n            streetAddress, \n            st\n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User'' \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person'' \n        AND sn=''*'' \n        AND givenName = ''*'' \n    ')    \n\nIn most cases you're done with that ... except your organisation has more the 900 users! Then you have to split the fetch in several requests, because SQL Server quits with an error, when trying to read more than 900 records via ADSI.  \n\nBest option is, to filter the ADSI statement by something like *'get all user starting with a to j'*, when you are sure, that in this case less than 900 records will be given back and repeat the statement several times and glue the data together via a ``UNION`` statement:\n\n<pre>\n<code>SELECT  \n    UserPrincipalName,  \n    DisplayName,  \n    sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName],  \n    sn AS [LastName],  \n    givenName AS [FirstName],  \n    title AS [Title],  \n    Mail as [MailAddress],  \n    department AS [Department],  \n    l AS [Location],  \n    postalCode AS [PostCode],  \n    streetAddress AS [Street],  \n    st AS [State]  \nFROM (  \n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '  \n        SELECT  \n            UserPrincipalName,  \n            DisplayName,  \n            sAMAccountName,  \n            sn,  \n            givenName,  \n            department,  \n            title,  \n            Mail,  \n            l,  \n            postalCode,  \n            streetAddress,  \n            st  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*''  \n        AND givenName = ''*''  \n        <strong>AND sAMAccountName &lt;= ''j''</strong>\n    ')  \n\n    <strong>UNION ALL</strong>  \n\n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '  \n        SELECT <em>[...same as above]</em>  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*''  \n        AND givenName = ''*''  \n        <strong>AND sAMAccountName &gt; ''j''</strong>  \n        <strong>AND sAMAccountName &lt; ''p''</strong>  \n    ')\n\n    <strong>UNION ALL</strong>  \n\n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI,  '  \n        SELECT <em>[...same as above]</em>  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*''  \n        <strong>AND sAMAccountName &gt;= ''p''</strong>  \n    ')  \n) AD</code>\n</pre>\n\nWhen you store this as a VIEW, you can join it wherever you want on SQL Server:\n\n<pre>\n<code>CREATE VIEW [dbo].[vADUsers]\nAS\n    <em>[...SQL code from above]</em>\n\nGO</code>\n</pre>\n\n## Step 3 - SQL Server Database Project\n\nIf you work with a SQL Server Database Project, to have the complete structure of your database available in a version control system, you will get some reference errors on compiling and publishing your newly added SQL View ``vADUsers`` and on some objects, which rely on this View, because of following problems:\n\n1. Project doesn't know the Linked Server `ADSI`\n2. The structure (fields) of the data source is unknown\n\n### Declare the Linked Server\n\nTo show the Project that there is a Linked Server called ``ADSI``, just add following lines at the start of your view:\n\n<pre>\n<code><strong>sp_addlinkedserver 'ADSI'</strong>\n<strong>GO</strong>\n\nCREATE VIEW [dbo].[vADUsers]\nAS\n    <em>[...SQL code from above]</em></code>\n</pre>\n\nThis mimics the adding of a Linked Server, but will be ignored by SQL Server on publish, because you already have a Linked Server with this name. The project is happy with it.\n\n### Declare the data structure\n\nWhen you use the SQL-View ``vADUsers`` in a Stored Procedure for example, this object won't compile, because the project knows nothing about the fields of the ADSI data source. The SELECT in the view is not enough. You have to add an empty ``SELECT`` to the View ``vADUsers``, just for the declaration of the fields and without returning any records and join this via ``UNION`` with the other statements:\n\n<pre>\n<code>sp_addlinkedserver 'ADSI'\nGO\n\nCREATE VIEW [dbo].[vtADAllUsers]\nAS\n\nSELECT\n    UserPrincipalName,\n    DisplayName,\n    sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName],\n    sn AS [LastName],\n    givenName AS [FirstName],\n    title AS [Title],\n    Mail as [MailAddress],\n    department AS [Department],\n    l AS [Location],\n    postalCode AS [PostCode],\n    streetAddress AS [Street],\n    st AS [State]\nFROM (\n\n    -- Fake SELECT to declare the structure of the view<strong>\n    SELECT TOP 0\n        '' UserPrincipalName,\n        '' DisplayName,\n        '' sAMAccountName,\n        '' sn,\n        '' givenName,\n        '' department,\n        '' title,\n        '' Mail,\n        '' l,\n        '' postalCode,\n        '' streetAddress,\n        '' st\n\n    UNION ALL</strong>\n\n    SELECT *\n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '\n        SELECT\n            UserPrincipalName,\n            DisplayName,\n            sAMAccountName,\n            sn,\n            givenName,\n            department,\n            title,\n            Mail,\n            l,\n            postalCode,\n            streetAddress,\n            st\n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''\n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''\n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''\n        AND sn=''*''\n        AND givenName = ''*''\n        AND sAMAccountName &gt;= ''j''  \n    ')\n\n    UNION ALL  \n\n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '  \n        SELECT <em>[...same as above]</em>  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*''  \n        AND givenName = ''*''  \n        AND sAMAccountName &lt; ''j''  \n        AND sAMAccountName &gt; ''p''  \n    ')\n\n    UNION ALL  \n\n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI,  '  \n        SELECT <em>[...same as above]</em>  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*''  \n        AND givenName = ''*''  \n        AND sAMAccountName &lt;= ''p''  \n    ')\n) AD</code>\n</pre>\n\nNow, you can fetch data from Active Directory and store the code in a Database Project properly.\n\nHAPPY CODING :)\n","tags":["ADSI","Visual Studio","Database Project"],"categories":["SQL"]},{"title":"About","url":"/about/index.html","content":"\n<section>\n\n# Hi there!\n\nI'm Kristof from the lovely snoring Wiesbaden, in sometimes too hot and most times to cold Germany.  \nI love three things: Software Development, Photography and first and foremost the brightest star in my sky: Leni.\n\ntl;dr\n</section>\n\n<section>\n\n# The Photo Enthusiast\n\nAs I was around 14 years old, I catched from wherever a [Praktika TL 1000](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praktica_Super_TL_500_und_Super_TL_1000), a fully mechanic SLR build in the former GDR. It was a revelation. I pointed my camera on everything and spend all my little money in developing the negatives and getting the prints. My first big purchase was a [Nikon F301](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F-301) with some additional lenses and some equipment for my own black/white darkroom at home in the  bathroom, for the joy of my family.\n\nSince then, I'm addicted to photography. I have even tried to become a photographer and started an apprenticeship in Frankfurt/Main after leaving school, but due to lack of support, I have given it up in favor of a \"decent\" profession, as my father would say ;)\n\nToday a have a lot of equipment, knowing that a good picture is done by the photographer and not by the camera, but it's part of the fun, carrying 3 ore more kilos around my shoulder, to grab the right lens for the right shot.\n\nFind some of my photographs on **500px** --- [https://500px.com/p/kikon](https://500px.com/p/kikon)\n\n</section>\n\n<section>\n\n# The Developer\n\nI'm a creative person and most people are shaking their heads in disbelief, when I'm telling them, that IT has a lot to do with creativity and not with math.\n\nWhile learning a lot of stuff about business as an industrial clerk trainee at the German headquarter of [Prime Computer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Computer) around 1990 (the decent profession), there was a guy in the warehouse, Colin Urquhart, who was working with a new type of computer, a x68 machine from IBM and he taught me something about it and ignited my fascination about the possibilities of a computer.\n\n<div style=\"width: 150px; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; float: right\">\n<img src=\"index/logo-prime.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-seperator.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-fh-wiesbaden.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-seperator.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-division-by-zero.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-seperator.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-goetzfried.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-seperator.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-allgeier-experts.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-seperator.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n<img src=\"index/logo-svg.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left;\" />\n</div>\n\nA little later I got in touch with a i386DX computer from Escom and started to fiddle around on how to achieve this or that under MS-DOS, installing Windows 3.x from a dozen of 3.5 discs, connecting via a 14.4k modem to the FidoNet (greets to all the guys from the 45er Infosystems) and talk shop with my fellow students at the [University of Applied Aciences, Wiesbaden](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hochschule_RheinMain), department of economics.\n\nOne of our teachers gave me a copy of Microsoft Access 1.1 and I started to explore the possibilities of this new relational database system. A short time later, our professor for computer science wanted to switch teaching DBase towards Access and so I became his assistant and held some class hours, where one of my students, having a little company on selling hardware, was asking me someday, if I was interested building Access-based software for his clients. I said yes. My starting point into a career as a freelance software developer.\n\nYears later, after dozens of clients, authoring a [book about Access](https://www.amazon.de/Das-Access-VBA-Codebook-Carsten-Grie%C3%9Fhammer/dp/3827319536), coming and going technologies, building (and leaving) my own company [Division by Zero](https://www.division-by-zero.de/) with my good friend [Marcus Michaels](https://de.linkedin.com/in/marcus-michaels-2896258a), I'm now Head of Software Development at [SVG](https://svg.de) in Frankfurt, leading a bunch of cool software designers and engineers on developing good and relevant software ... and my creativity is demanded day by day.\n\nI'm still first and foremost fascinated by the technology on building software, in particular in creating pleasing, but functional UI's, a user wants to works with, even if I spend my daily working time on management stuff.
