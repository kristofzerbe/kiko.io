[{"title":"A New Blog: VS Code, Hexo and GitHub Pages","url":"/categories/Tools/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","content":"\nA few days ago I puzzled over a technical problem regarding SQL Server, Active Directory and Visual Studio Database Projects. With tips, hints and snippets from several websites I got it running and the solution was absolutely memorable. For myself and for others. Nothing is harder than to know 'you did this before...', but not to remember how.\n\nBecause of this strong leaning towards oblivion, I started over 20 years ago my very first website **zerbit.de**, manually crafted with Classic ASP and a SQL Server database as backend, with an editor, tagging, categories and so on. It was really exciting to build this blog from scratch and writing articles for it, but it was so time consuming to expand the features of the website and keep it running, that some day I quit it silently.\n\nSo, to document the solution mentioned above, I could use tools like OneNote or others, like in the past years, but this would be just for me and not for all developers, who have a similar problem. I felt it would be unfair to participate from the knowledge of others to get my solution and dont give something back.\n\nI decided to write an article just in HTML and publish it on my personal GitHub Page that I didn't used so far. Ok, just Text ... ugly. Just a little CSS and a little more structure and maybe I should do something with Vue JS ... STOP ... It would be better to pick one of the cool new static website generators based on Node.js, to detain myself from inventing the wheel again and save my time to write articles. So I did a little research and found [HEXO](https://hexo.io) ... Bingo! I can work with my favorite editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), its all HTML, JavaScript and CSS, I can write my articles in Markdown and Hexo has a lot of helpers for stuff Markdown doesn't provide, it produces static files and works only with files, therefore no need for a database ... and it is well documented.\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Installation\n\n.. is quite easy, as described here: [https://hexo.io/docs/setup](https://hexo.io/docs/setup)\n\n1. Create folder and open in VS Code\n2. Open VS Code Terminal window\n3. Install Hexo with ``$ npm install -g hexo-cli``\n4. Init Hexo project with ``$ hexo init``\n5. Install dependencies with ``npm install``\n6. Done\n\n{% asset_img vscode-1.png \"New Hexo Project\" %}\n\n## Writing\n\n### Create new post/draft\n\nHexo has posts and drafts, whereat drafts has to published via a Hexo command to become a post. To create an article use the command ``hexo new post|draft \"My Title\"``. The title will be converted in a URL-encoded string and will be used as file name and url.\n\n### Meta data\nEvery post/draft starts with its header (so called [Front Matter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter)) to store some meta data, which describes the post, like ``title``, ``date``, ``tags`` or ``categories``. This is used by Hexo to classify and arrange your post during the build.\n\n### Markdown\nHexo posts/drafts are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). A good syntax reference is the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).\n\n### Excerpt\nIs is usual to show a short excerpt an the start page of a blog, to keep it compact and teasering the user to click on a READ MORE button. To achieve this, you just have to add following comment to your article. Everything above is the excerpt and everything below is only shown, when you enter the article:\n\n    <!-- more -->\n\n### Images\n\nSome articles will contain images to illustrate something and the question is, where should they be stored? Answer: In a folder beside the post/draft, which has the same name as the article MD file. To get this, you have to activate the setting ``post_asset_folder`` in your ``_config.yml``. Now this folder will be created automatically, when you add a new post/draft.\n\nIn your Markdown you reference your image with:\n\n    {% asset_img image-1.png \"Test Image\" %}\n\n\n{% asset_img vscode-2.png \"Image\" %}\n\n## Build\n\nHexo is a website generator, so a build will generate the whole website in a special folder, which has to be published. This output folder can be configured in the ``_config.yml``:\n\n    public_dir: public\n\nTo wipe the output folder run the command:\n\n    hexo clean\n\nTo start the build run:\n\n    hexo generate\n\nTo view the website via the build-in local Hexo server run:\n\n    hexo server\n\n## Publishing\n\nMost complex task for me was to publish the new blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). My first approach was to use my personal page, as I did with my single HTML file, but this didn't work, because I wanted to store the whole project on GitHub and it is not possible to point a personal page to the subdirectory **docs** or use a different branch as **master**.\n\nThe simple solution was to create a new repository, named after my my blog **kiko.io**, to store everything and point the GitHub Page to the subdirectory **docs** in settings of the repository.\n\n{% asset_img github-1.png \"GitHub Settings\" %}\n\nBy overriding the default publish folder of Hexo in ``_config.yml``, everything was set up. Commit and Push via git...\n\n    public_dir: docs\n\nHexo has its own deploying mechanism and it is advisable to disable it, by commenting out the Deployment section ``_config.yml``.\n\nNext step was to use my own custom domain for the blog. To achieve this, the most easiest way is to create a text file named ``CNAME`` (without extension!) with the content of the domain in a single line and publish this file in the root of the docs folder. Github will recognize this file and do the setup automatically.\n\nTo point the domain to GitHub, I had to create following ``A`` records in my domain providers DNS settings:\n\n* 185.199.108.153\n* 185.199.109.153\n* 185.199.110.153\n* 185.199.111.153\n\nLast step was to enable **Enforce HTTPS** in the repositories settings. \n\n---\n\n## Related\n\n* [A New Blog (Part Two): Customizing Hexo](/categories/Tools/A-New-Blog-Customizing-Hexo/)\n","tags":["VS Code","Hexo","GitHub","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"A New Blog: Customizing Hexo","url":"/categories/Tools/A-New-Blog-Customizing-Hexo/","content":"\nHexo is a great tool to get quick results, when you decide to have a blog and its defaults are practical, but it's power lies in the possiblities of customization via plugins. On the [official plugin page](https://hexo.io/plugins/index.html), there are actually 302 plugins listed, but there are many more and no wish will be unsatisfied.\n\nI will show you which of these I found worth to work with...\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Relative Image Path\n\nThe build-in way to include images in your posts works fine, but it is a little aside the normal way to declare images in Markdown. The plugin [Hexo Asset Link] corrects that. After installing via ``npm install hexo-asset-link --save`` you can write this:\n\n    ![Test Image](hello-world/image-1.png)\n\n**UPDATE**: Actually the plugin [destroys external links](https://github.com/liolok/hexo-asset-link/issues/3), so don't use it until this is fixed ... or go to **node_modules** &gt; **hexo-asset-link** &gt; **index.js** in your project and change in line 22 ``protocal`` to ``protocol``.\n\n### Hide Posts\n\nA new Hexo project comes with a sample post called ``Hello World``. This is fine to play around with, but you don't want to publish it. Here comes a Hexo plugin to the rescue called [Hexo Hide Posts](https://github.com/printempw/hexo-hide-posts). After installing, you just have to write ``hidden: true`` to the Front Matter of you post and it won't be shown on the blog, but it is still available by URL.\n\n### Static Files\n\nHexo has the concept of [Assets Folders](https://hexo.io/docs/asset-folders), but for static files, beside article based files, I find it more useful to have a STATIC folder and copy the contents on every build into the publish folder. A good helper for this approach is the plugin [Hexo Generator Copy](https://github.com/niahoo/hexo-generator-copy). Install it by running ``npm install hexo-generator-copy --save`` and add ``static_dir: static`` to your ``_config.yml`` and you are done.\n\n![Hexo Static Files](A-New-Blog-Customizing-Hexo/vscode-1.png)\n\n### Feed\n\nThe default Hexo layout has an Atom Feed icon in the upper right corner, but strangely no feed file is generated on build. You need to install the plugin [Hexo Feed Generator](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed) to fix this, by running ``npm install hexo-generator-feed --save`` and copy following section into the ``_config.yml``:\n\n    feed:\n        type: atom\n        path: atom.xml\n        limit: 20\n        hub:\n        content:\n        content_limit: 140\n        content_limit_delim: ' '\n        order_by: -date\n\n### Manifest for PWA\n\nIn these modern times it's always a good idea, that your blog feels like an App. For this you need a manifest file (JSON) an several icons (PNG). You can generate these files very fast with the [Web App Manifest Generator](https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com) and store it in your static folder.\n\nTo bind this file into your blog, you can use the plugin [Hexo PWA](https://github.com/lavas-project/hexo-pwa). Run ``npm install --save hexo-pwa`` and copy following section to your ``_config.yml``, where you take the settings from your generated manifest file:\n\n    pwa:\n    manifest:\n        path: /manifest.json\n        body:\n        name: myblog.de\n        short_name: My Blog\n        icons:\n            - src: /images/icon-192x192.png\n            sizes: 192x192\n            type: image/png\n            - src: /images/icon-512x512.png\n            sizes: 512x512\n            type: image/png\n        start_url: /index.html\n        theme_color: '#025ab1'\n        background_color: '#dddddd'\n        display: standalone\n\n### Sitemap File\n\nTo help [Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668) and others a bit to index your blog, it is advisable to provide a sitemap file. Here comes [Hexo Generator Sitemap](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap) to the rescue. Install it by running the command ``npm install hexo-generator-sitemap --save``. You can configure it via ``_config.yml``:\n\n    sitemap:\n        path: sitemap.xml\n        template: ./sitemap-template.xml\n\nThe plugin installation doesn't create the needed ``sitemap-template`` file, so be sure you grab a copy from the plugins repository: [https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap/blob/master/sitemap.xml](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap/blob/master/sitemap.xml)\n\n### Commenting\n\nHexo doesn't have a commenting system, but it's prepared to stick [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments under each article. Just create a new Disqus account for your blog and note the given short name. By adding following section to the ``_config.yml`` Hexo shows the commenting section:\n\n    disqus_enabled: true\n    disqus_shortname: my-blog\n\n### Inifinite Scroll\n\nHexo shows as much articles at the start page as configured in ``_config.yml`` under ``index_generator.per_page``, but it's nicer to load more articles as you scroll by using the Hexo script [Inifinite Scroll](https://github.com/FrontendSophie/hexo-infinite-scroll). Install by adding following little script in **themes** & gt; **layout** &gt; **_partial** &gt; **after-footer.ejs**\n\n    <script src=\"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/frontendsophie/hexo-infinite-scroll@2.0.0/dist/main.js\"></script> \n    <script>\n        infiniteScroll({\n        showNum: 5,\n        style: 'line-scale',\n        color: '#025ab1'\n        })\n    </script>\n\n### Back To Top\n\nIts nice to support the reader on scolling by providing a Scroll-To-Top button. The easiest way to get this, is the script [Vanilla Back To Top](https://github.com/vfeskov/vanilla-back-to-top). Just add follwing to **themes** &gt;**layout** &gt; **_partial** &gt; **after-footer.ejs**:\n\n    <script>addBackToTop({\n        diameter: 30,\n        backgroundColor: 'rgb(0, 90, 180)',\n        textColor: '#fff'\n    })\n    </script>\n    <style>\n    #back-to-top {\n        border-radius: 0;\n        opacity: 0.6;\n    }\n    #back-to-top:hover {\n        opacity: 1;\n    }\n    </style>\n\n---\n\n## Related\n\n* [A New Blog (Part One): VS Code, Hexo and GitHub Pages](/categories/Tools/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/)\n","tags":["VS Code","Hexo","Blogging"],"categories":["Tools"]},{"title":"How-To: Visual Studio Database Project and ADSI","url":"/categories/SQL/How-To-Visual-Studio-Database-Project-and-ADSI/","content":"If you are working with a Visual Studio Database Project and have to deal with data from the Active Directory via a Linked Server, you have to announce the data structure of the AD data in order to get the project compiled.\n<!-- more -->\n## Step 1 - Linking to the Active Directory\n\nFirst of all you have to connect your SQL Server to the AD permanently, by running  following SQL script once on your SQL Server:\n\n    USE [master]\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedserver @server = N'ADSI', \n        @srvproduct=N'Active Directory Service Interfaces', \n        @provider=N'ADSDSOObject', \n        @datasrc=N'adsdatasource'\n    \n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedsrvlogin @rmtsrvname=N'ADSI',\n        @useself=N'False',\n        @locallogin=NULL,\n        @rmtuser=N'mydomain\\myadminuser',\n        @rmtpassword='mypassword'\n    GO\n    \n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'collation compatible', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'data access', @optvalue=N'true'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'dist', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'pub', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'rpc', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'rpc out', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'sub', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'connect timeout', @optvalue=N'0'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'collation name', @optvalue=null\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'lazy schema validation', @optvalue=N'false'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'query timeout', @optvalue=N'0'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'use remote collation', @optvalue=N'true'\n    GO\n    EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N'ADSI', \n        @optname=N'remote proc transaction promotion', @optvalue=N'true'\n    GO\n\n## Step 2 - Fetching ADSI data  \n\nTo get data, use ``OpenQuery`` against the Linked Server. In order to get only persons and no system accounts, you should filter out all users, which has no firstname (``givenName``) or lastname (``sn``):\n\n    SELECT \n        UserPrincipalName, \n        DisplayName, \n        sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName], \n        sn AS [LastName], \n        givenName AS [FirstName], \n        title AS [Title], \n        Mail as [MailAddress],\n        department AS [Department],\n        l AS [Location], \n        postalCode AS [PostCode], \n        streetAddress AS [Street],\n        st AS [State]\n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '\n        SELECT \n            UserPrincipalName, \n            DisplayName, \n            sAMAccountName, \n            sn, \n            givenName, \n            department,\n            title, \n            Mail, \n            l, \n            postalCode, \n            streetAddress, \n            st\n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User'' \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person'' \n        AND sn=''*'' \n        AND givenName = ''*'' \n    ')    \n\nIn most cases you're done with that ... except your organisation has more the 900 users! Then you have to split the fetch in several requests, because SQL Server quits with an error, when trying to read more than 900 records via ADSI.  \n\nBest option is, to filter the ADSI statement by something like *'get all user starting with a to j'*, when you are sure, that in this case less than 900 records will be given back and repeat the statement several times and glue the data together via a ``UNION`` statement:\n\n<pre>\n<code>SELECT  \n    UserPrincipalName,  \n    DisplayName,  \n    sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName],  \n    sn AS [LastName],  \n    givenName AS [FirstName],  \n    title AS [Title],  \n    Mail as [MailAddress],  \n    department AS [Department],  \n    l AS [Location],  \n    postalCode AS [PostCode],  \n    streetAddress AS [Street],  \n    st AS [State]  \nFROM (  \n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '  \n        SELECT  \n            UserPrincipalName,  \n            DisplayName,  \n            sAMAccountName,  \n            sn,  \n            givenName,  \n            department,  \n            title,  \n            Mail,  \n            l,  \n            postalCode,  \n            streetAddress,  \n            st  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*''  \n        AND givenName = ''*''  \n        <strong>AND sAMAccountName &lt;= ''j''</strong>\n    ')  \n\n    <strong>UNION ALL</strong>  \n\n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '  \n        SELECT <em>[...same as above]</em>  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*''  \n        AND givenName = ''*''  \n        <strong>AND sAMAccountName &gt; ''j''</strong>  \n        <strong>AND sAMAccountName &lt; ''p''</strong>  \n    ')\n\n    <strong>UNION ALL</strong>  \n\n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI,  '  \n        SELECT <em>[...same as above]</em>  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*''  \n        <strong>AND sAMAccountName &gt;= ''p''</strong>  \n    ')  \n) AD</code>\n</pre>\n\nWhen you store this as a VIEW, you can join it wherever you want on SQL Server:\n\n<pre>\n<code>CREATE VIEW [dbo].[vADUsers]\nAS\n    <em>[...SQL code from above]</em>\n\nGO</code>\n</pre>\n\n## Step 3 - SQL Server Database Project\n\nIf you work with a SQL Server Database Project, to have the complete structure of your database available in a version control system, you will get some reference errors on compiling and publishing your newly added SQL View ``vADUsers`` and on some objects, which rely on this View, because of following problems:\n\n1. Project doesn't know the Linked Server `ADSI`\n2. The structure (fields) of the data source is unknown\n\n### Declare the Linked Server\n\nTo show the Project that there is a Linked Server called ``ADSI``, just add following lines at the start of your view:\n\n<pre>\n<code><strong>sp_addlinkedserver 'ADSI'</strong>\n<strong>GO</strong>\n\nCREATE VIEW [dbo].[vADUsers]\nAS\n    <em>[...SQL code from above]</em></code>\n</pre>\n\nThis mimics the adding of a Linked Server, but will be ignored by SQL Server on publish, because you already have a Linked Server with this name. The project is happy with it.\n\n### Declare the data structure\n\nWhen you use the SQL-View ``vADUsers`` in a Stored Procedure for example, this object won't compile, because the project knows nothing about the fields of the ADSI data source. The SELECT in the view is not enough. You have to add an empty ``SELECT`` to the View ``vADUsers``, just for the declaration of the fields and without returning any records and join this via ``UNION`` with the other statements:\n\n<pre>\n<code>sp_addlinkedserver 'ADSI'\nGO\n\nCREATE VIEW [dbo].[vtADAllUsers]\nAS\n\nSELECT\n    UserPrincipalName,\n    DisplayName,\n    sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName],\n    sn AS [LastName],\n    givenName AS [FirstName],\n    title AS [Title],\n    Mail as [MailAddress],\n    department AS [Department],\n    l AS [Location],\n    postalCode AS [PostCode],\n    streetAddress AS [Street],\n    st AS [State]\nFROM (\n\n    -- Fake SELECT to declare the structure of the view<strong>\n    SELECT TOP 0\n        '' UserPrincipalName,\n        '' DisplayName,\n        '' sAMAccountName,\n        '' sn,\n        '' givenName,\n        '' department,\n        '' title,\n        '' Mail,\n        '' l,\n        '' postalCode,\n        '' streetAddress,\n        '' st\n\n    UNION ALL</strong>\n\n    SELECT *\n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '\n        SELECT\n            UserPrincipalName,\n            DisplayName,\n            sAMAccountName,\n            sn,\n            givenName,\n            department,\n            title,\n            Mail,\n            l,\n            postalCode,\n            streetAddress,\n            st\n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''\n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''\n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''\n        AND sn=''*''\n        AND givenName = ''*''\n        AND sAMAccountName &gt;= ''j''  \n    ')\n\n    UNION ALL  \n\n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, '  \n        SELECT <em>[...same as above]</em>  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*''  \n        AND givenName = ''*''  \n        AND sAMAccountName &lt; ''j''  \n        AND sAMAccountName &gt; ''p''  \n    ')\n\n    UNION ALL  \n\n    SELECT *  \n    FROM OpenQuery(ADSI,  '  \n        SELECT <em>[...same as above]</em>  \n        FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de''  \n        WHERE objectClass =  ''User''  \n        AND objectCategory = ''Person''  \n        AND sn=''*''  \n        AND givenName = ''*''  \n        AND sAMAccountName &lt;= ''p''  \n    ')\n) AD</code>\n</pre>\n\nNow, you can fetch data from Active Directory and store the code in a Database Project properly.\n\nHAPPY CODING :)\n","tags":["ADSI","Visual Studio","Database Project"],"categories":["SQL"]}]
