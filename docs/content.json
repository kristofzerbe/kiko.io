It was a revelation. I pointed my camera on everything and spend all my little money in developing the negatives and getting the prints. My first big purchase was a Nikon F301 with some additional lenses and some equipment for my own black/white darkroom at home in the bathroom, for the joy of my family. Since then, I’m addicted to photography. I have even tried to become a photographer and started an apprenticeship in Frankfurt/Main after leaving school, but due to lack of support, I have given it up in favor of a “decent” profession, as my father would say ;) Today a have a lot of equipment, knowing that a good picture is done by the photographer and not by the camera, but it’s part of the fun, carrying 3 ore more kilos around my shoulder, to grab the right lens for the right shot. Find some of my photographs on 500px — https://500px.com/p/kikon The DeveloperI’m a creative person and most people are shaking their heads in disbelief, when I’m telling them, that IT has a lot to do with creativity and not with math. While learning a lot of stuff about business as an industrial clerk trainee at the German headquarter of Prime Computer around 1990 (the decent profession), there was a guy in the warehouse, Colin Urquhart, who was working with a new type of computer, a x68 machine from IBM and he taught me something about it and ignited my fascination about the possibilities of a computer. A little later I got in touch with a i386DX computer from Escom and started to fiddle around on how to achieve this or that under MS-DOS, installing Windows 3.x from a dozen of 3.5 discs, connecting via a 14.4k modem to the FidoNet (greets to all the guys from the 45er Infosystems) and talk shop with my fellow students at the University of Applied Aciences, Wiesbaden, department of economics. One of our teachers gave me a copy of Microsoft Access 1.1 and I started to explore the possibilities of this new relational database system. A short time later, our professor for computer science wanted to switch teaching DBase towards Access and so I became his assistant and held some class hours, where one of my students, having a little company on selling hardware, was asking me someday, if I was interested building Access-based software for his clients. I said yes. My starting point into a career as a freelance software developer. Years later, after dozens of clients, authoring a book about Access, coming and going technologies, building (and leaving) my own company Division by Zero with my good friend Marcus Michaels, I’m now Head of Software Development at SVG in Frankfurt, leading a bunch of cool software designers and engineers on developing good and relevant software … and my creativity is demanded day by day. I’m still first and foremost fascinated by the technology on building software, in particular in creating pleasing, but functional UI’s, a user wants to works with, even if I spend my daily working time on management stuff. So it is not surprising that I sit at my laptop in my spare time, working on my private projects or trying out new technologies. I made by hobby a profession… If you want to talk about the old, recent or new times in IT, you can find me at: Xinghttps://www.xing.com/profile/Kristof_Zerbe LinkedInhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/kristof-zerbe-91012510/ GitHubhttps://github.com/kristofzerbe The Tool GuyMy colleagues always start to giggle, when I’m telling them that I’ve found a new tool, which is doing this or that. I’m the Tool Guy. I love to look for those little helpers, which saves my time.

But … it’s only the image, without a visual reference to the post itself. In this article I want to show you how to combine the photo with some meta information of the post automatically, to get a Social Media Image. Starting point of my thoughts were two posts from Drew McLellan (Dynamic Social Sharing Images) and Ryan Filler (Automatic Social Share Images), to which I have already referred in my post Discoveries #11. Drew and Ryan utilizes the Node.JS library Puppeteer, which runs a headless Chromium (or Chrome browser) over the DevTools protocol to process a web page … for example to take a screenshot: 12345678const puppeteer = require(&#x27;puppeteer&#x27;);(async () =&gt; &#123; const browser = await puppeteer.launch(); const page = await browser.newPage(); await page.goto(&#x27;https://example.com&#x27;); await page.screenshot(&#123; path: &#x27;example.png&#x27; &#125;); await browser.close();&#125;)(); The idea is, to create a temporary HTML page with the photo and all necessary text for the social media image, take a screenshot of it and save it as PNG. As I run my blog with Hexo, a Static Site Generator (SSG), all information about a post is defined in a Markdown (MD) file with some Frontmatter for the meta information. Therefore, the Social Media Image Generator script in my mind had to do following tasks: Iterate recursively over all MD files in Hexo _source/posts folder Read the MD’s Frontmatter (for information about photo, title, subtitle and more) Create a temporary HTML file with the aid of a template Run Puppeteer script over the temporary file to take a screenshot Store the PNG to a central folder Optimize the PNG Change the meta tags in the posts to reference the new image The FrontmatterI pimped the Frontmatter of the original Hexo configuration a bit, in order to provide an individual photo for each post: 123456789101112---title: Generate Social Media Images Automaticallysubtitle:date: 2021-07-10 11:07:31photograph: file: DSC_6776.jpg name: Color Brushes link: &#x27;https://500px.com/photo/79965349&#x27;categories: - JavaScript...--- Among other, there are the basic information, I wanted to have on my social media image: photograph.file (as the image itself) and title, subtitle and categories (for the text on the image). The ScriptThe complete script, in two versions (CommonJS and ES Module) is available at GitHub. tl;dr My script became a JavaScript class, separating the tasks in several methods and a constructor to get all necessary information as parameters. The class exports the main method generate() for calling the script: social-media-image-generator.cjs12345678910111213141516171819202122232425const _currentPath = __dirname;var _postFolder;var _photoFolder;var _templateFile;var _targetFolder;class Generator &#123; constructor(postFolder, photoFolder, templateFile, targetFolder) &#123; _postFolder = path.join(_currentPath, postFolder); _photoFolder = path.join(_currentPath, photoFolder); _templateFile = path.join(_currentPath, templateFile); _targetFolder = path.join(_currentPath, targetFolder); &#125; generate() &#123; ... &#125; getPostFiles(dirPath, allFiles) &#123; ... &#125; async processPost(fileName, vars) &#123; ... &#125; async createImage(fileName, tempFile) &#123; ... &#125;&#125;module.exports.Generator = Generator I chose parameters, in order not to bind the script too tightly to my favourite SSG Hexo: _postFolder - Where are the post files stored? _photoFolder - Where are the photos stored? _templateFile - Where is the template file for the temporary HTML stored? _targetFolder - Where should the generated PNG files be stored? Get the postsFirst task was to get all MD files out of the _postFolder recursively: social-media-image-generator.cjs123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930const fs = require(&quot;fs&quot;);const path = require(&quot;path&quot;);class Generator &#123; generate() &#123; const postFiles = this.getPostFiles(_postFolder); &#125; getPostFiles(dirPath, allFiles) &#123; // READ FOLDER CONTENT let files = fs.readdirSync(dirPath); //INIT TEMP ARRAY allFiles = allFiles || []; files.forEach((file) =&gt; &#123; if (fs.statSync(dirPath + &quot;/&quot; + file).isDirectory()) &#123; // CALL THE METHOD RECURSIVELY allFiles = this.getPostFiles(dirPath + &quot;/&quot; + file, allFiles) &#125; else if (file.indexOf(&quot;.md&quot;)&gt;=0) &#123; // PUSH MD FILES TO TEMP ARRAY allFiles.push(path.join(dirPath, &quot;/&quot;, file)) &#125; &#125;); return allFiles; &#125; &#125;&#125; Get the template and the temporary folderI chose Handlebars as the template engine to generate the temporary HTML file, because it is so easy to handle. social-media-image.handlebars1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;style&gt; ... &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;wrap&quot;&gt; ... &lt;img id=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;&#123;&#123;photo&#125;&#125;&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt; ... &lt;section id=&quot;title&quot;&gt; &#123;&#123;#each categories&#125;&#125; &lt;small&gt;&#123;&#123;this&#125;&#125;&lt;/small&gt; &#123;&#123;/each&#125;&#125; &lt;h1&gt;&#123;&#123;title&#125;&#125;&lt;/h1&gt; &#123;&#123;#if subtitle&#125;&#125; &lt;h2&gt;&#123;&#123;subtitle&#125;&#125;&lt;/h2&gt; &#123;&#123;/if&#125;&#125; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;... Handlebars is able to compile a template into a JavaScript variable, what makes it easy to reuse it. Good for performance and stability. As I wanted to utilize the template to generate temporary HTML files, I needed a temporary folder, which can be deleted afterwards. social-media-image-generator.cjs123456789101112131415161718192021222324const handlebars = require(&quot;handlebars&quot;);var _template;const _tempFolder = &quot;./~temp&quot;;class Generator &#123;

&quot;../static/images/social-media&quot; Hexo IntegrationIn case you are running your blog with Hexo also, you can hook on the ready event to let it run on hexo generate automatically: /scripts/on-ready-generate-social-media-images.js1234567891011121314151617181920const log = require(&#x27;hexo-log&#x27;)(&#123;

const generator = new Generator(postFolder, photoFolder, templateFile, targetFolder); generator.generate();&#125;); It is important not to store the social-media-image-generator.cjs in Hexo’s scripts folder like the event script above, because Hexo will try to execute it automatically. You have to create a different folder like lib to store and reference it from there. The ResultHere is the result from my approach in Hexo, as I run hexo generate for this blog post: The very last thing I had to do, was to change the source of the image meta tag mentioned at the top, to reference to newly created social media image.

Typed npm install and the hell was breaking loose … 186 direct dependencies and nearly 200K of files were flooding my harddrive! The mental basis of IT is lazyness, which means that we produce software to make our and others life easier. This also applies to the building process. Don’t reinvent the wheel, but reuse the work of other developers. But … we have to recognize the limits and prevent to fall into the dependency hell. To get a better overview over dependencies, regarding NPM and other repositories, some Google engineers have published a project called Open Source Insights a couple of days ago. If you look at a library on NPM, you immediately see the direct dependencies, but that could just be the tip of the iceberg. Insights shows you the big picture in form of an interactive graph or a complete list with many additional information of the complete dependency chain. As Google says: Your software and your users rely not only on the code you write, but also on the code your code depends on, the code that code depends on, and so on. An accurate view of the complete dependency graph is critical to understanding the state of your project. Next time, before you type npm install ... take a quick look at the Insights page of the library, because it won’t give you an overview over the dependecies only, but also some security advisories to let you decide if it is a good idea to use it. Very valueable for the authors of exisiting NPM projects also, because it shows the consequences of dependency decisions very clearly and gives hints to make the own library less sensitive to vulnerabilities. Let us hope, that Google removes the describing adjective experimental from the project some day and adds more and more functionality to it (like a working responsiveness ;) in order to establish Open Source Insights as a main source of information about reusable Open Source software.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Great Finds","slug":"Great-Finds","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Great-Finds/"}]},{"title":"Discoveries #10","subtitle":null,"series":"Discoveries","date":"2021-05-24","updated":"2021-06-28","path":"post/Discoveries-10/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Discoveries-10/","excerpt":"Todays Discoveries it’s all about my favourite programming language JavaScript.

It is able to convert old-fashioned Pingbacks to Webmentions, supports deleting of unwanted mentions, has a Blocklist for blocking domains, Webhooks for real-time processing and last but not least an API to get all your Webmentions per page or per site. Setupwebmention.io needs a registration and Aaron uses his own authentication method Web Sign-In over IndieLogin to achieve that. After you have signed in, you see your settings with two important links, you have to integrate in the head of your HTML: 12&lt;link rel=&quot;webmention&quot; href=&quot;https://webmention.io/[YOUR-BLOG-DOMAIN]/webmention&quot; /&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;pingback&quot; href=&quot;https://webmention.io/[YOUR-BLOG-DOMAIN]/xmlrpc&quot; /&gt; They define your page on the one hand as a webmention- and on the other hand as a pingback endpoint. Every send Webmention or Pingback from another blog is routed to these URL’s. You will also find your API Key on this page. To be honest, is not a real API key, but rather a key to retrieve all incoming webmentions at once. Therefore it does not need to be kept private and secured. There is no way to modify your incoming Webmentions over it. Incoming Webmentions I’m implementing my Hexo/Webmention solution as I’m writing this post, therefore I don’t have any Webmentions to show as an example. Since all mentions on webmention.io are publicly accessible, I simply use Max Böcks article Using Webmentions in Eleventy in the following. Max, I hope it is ok … :) Aaron has defined three ways to get the incoming mentions of a particular article on your blog: 1. View as HTML page https://webmention.io/api/mentions.html?target=https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/ Using it this way, webmention.io integrates the content with some styles and other information of the sending post for easy reading. 2. Consume as Atom feed https://webmention.io/api/mentions.atom?target=https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/ 3. Get as JSON https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?target=https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/ Especially the last one is interesting for us, because we can use it to automate getting the data and integrate it in our blog post. You can also use all these Url’s to get the Webmentions of all of your pages, by changing the target parameter into: ...?token=[YOUR-API-KEY] The feed with token for getting all webmentions is particularly practical for checking whether there are new ones for your blog via a feed reader. There are some parameters you have to be aware of: Parameter Example Paging ?per-page=20&amp;page=0 (default, page 1 with 20 entries) Sorting By ?sort-by=created (default) Sorting Direction ?sort-dir=down (default, newest first) Time Limit ?since=2021-05-10T12:00:00-0700 ID Limit ?since_id=500). You can find more on parameters in the documentation of webmention.io’s source code here: https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io. The DataLet’s dive into the data. The JSON is a list and every Webmention is an entry underneath children, with following useful fields: Field Purpose author.name Name of the sender author.photo Avatar photo of the sender author.url Personal URL of the sender wm-id Unique ID of the Webmention wm-target URL of your post wm-received UTC Date/Time sended wm-source URL of the sending post published Publish Date/Time of the sending post wm-property Webmention type out of the following values:mention-of&nbsp;:&nbsp;Mention as link in postin-reply-to&nbsp;:&nbsp;Reply to your postlike-of&nbsp;:&nbsp;Like of your postrepost-of&nbsp;:&nbsp;Repost of your postbookmark-of&nbsp;:&nbsp;Bookmark of your post Other occuring fields are optional, but no less interesting for displaying them at your post: Field Purpose name Name of the Webmention (title of the sending post or something) summary.type Summary type of the Webmention, e.g. “text/plain” summary.value Summary text of the Webmention content.html Content as HTML of sending post content.text Content as text of sending post The fact that we get the complete HTML content of the sending post, means that we easily can parse it for IndieWeb microformats (see Part 1) to get even more information about it and the blog owner! IntegrationWe have two ways to choose from in order to integrate the data thus obtained into the post: Static … means while generating the site Dynamic … means real-time via client-side Javascript The static approach has two big disadvantages: The Webmentions are only visible with a time delay, due to the need of generating the pages of the site Hexos generation mechanism only takes those, whose content has beed updated in the meanwhile, but do not take into account any external data like Webmentions. We would have to fire up the time consuming clean and generate all the time So, let’s go for the dynamic approach, a little bit JavaScript, which loads the Webmentions on page load (like most Commenting platforms do). First of all, we need a placeholder in our article.ejs, where the Webmentions will be displayed. Somewhere near the comments and implemented as another partial: layout/_partial/article.ejs12345678910111213&lt;article id=&quot;&lt;%= post.layout %&gt;-&lt;%= post.slug %&gt;&quot; class=&quot;article article-type-&lt;%= post.layout %&gt; h-entry&quot; itemscope itemprop=&quot;blogPost&quot;&gt; ... &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/webmentions&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/comments&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/related&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/nav&#x27;) %&gt;&lt;/article&gt; layout/_partial/post/webmentions.ejs12345678910111213&lt;div class=&quot;article-webmentions&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;webmentions-placeholder&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;wm-placeholder&quot;&gt;No Webmentions yet...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;script&gt; window.addEventListener(&#x27;load&#x27;, function () &#123; insertWebmentions(&#x27;&lt;%- post.slug.toLowerCase() %&gt;&#x27;); &#125;) &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt; The call insertWebmentions references to the asset script webmentions.js, which will be bundled via Grunt in my case, but you can place it where you want and add it to your articles head element. The main thing is, that it will load when the article page is launched. The script checks, if the user has already loaded the Webmentions for the current page from webmention.io in the last hour and do so if not, and stores the data in the browser by the pages key (slug) and with a timestamp: assets/webmentions.js12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243function insertWebmentions(key) &#123; const lsTimestamp = &quot;wmts_&quot; + key; const lsWebmentions = &quot;wm_&quot; + key; const currentUrl = window.location.href; const wmUrl = `https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?target=$&#123;currentUrl&#125;&amp;per-page=1000&amp;sort-dir=up`; let lastRequest; let webmentions; // Get data from browser storage, if available if (localStorage.getItem(lsTimestamp) &amp;&amp; localStorage.getItem(lsWebmentions)) &#123; lastRequest = localStorage.getItem(lsTimestamp); webmentions = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(lsWebmentions)); &#125; if(webmentions &amp;&amp; lastRequest &amp;&amp; Math.abs(Date.now() - lastRequest) / (60*60*1000) &lt; 1) &#123; // Webmentions are present and not older than an hour process(); &#125; else &#123; // Get Webmentions from webmention.io load().then(() =&gt; &#123; process(); &#125;); &#125;; /** * Load webmention.io&#x27;s JSON data for the current page */ async function load() &#123; const response = await fetch(wmUrl); webmentions = await response.json(); localStorage.setItem(lsWebmentions, JSON.stringify(webmentions)); localStorage.setItem(lsTimestamp, Date.now()); &#125; /** * Process Webmentions */ function process() &#123; ... &#125;&#125; Actually the script loads the first 1000 Webmentions in ascending order of their retreiving date. Should last for a while or I may feel like adding real paging at some point ;) On processing the webmentions, a separate HTML block is generated for each type (wm-property) regarding the content of the Webmention, whereby the header is always the same. The VERB refers to the Webmentions type: mentioned, replied, liked, bookmarked or reposted.

Therefore, it is good to give the user a possibility to submit his blog post, where he mentions yours, directly. As webmentions.io supports posting a new source, the HTML form is quite simple an we can integrate it in the partial from above, below the script tag: layout/_partial/post/webmentions.ejs1234567891011121314151617181920&lt;div class=&quot;article-webmentions&quot;&gt; ... &lt;form class=&quot;webmention-form&quot; action=&quot;https://webmention.io/&lt;%- config.title %&gt;&gt;/webmention&quot; name=&quot;webmention-form&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;webmention-form-source&quot;&gt;Your Article URL:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;input class=&quot;webmention-form-source&quot; type=&quot;url&quot; name=&quot;source&quot; placeholder=&quot;https://your-blog.com/your-article&quot; required=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;target&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Send Webmention&quot;&gt; &lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt; The variable config.title defines the name of your blog with which you have registered at webmention.io. In the hidden input, we use the permalink of the current page/article as the mentions target. Building BridgesYes, the IndieWeb and Webmentions are an alternative concept of social networking, bypassing the big silos like Facebook, Twitter and Co. … but they exist and they have a massive reach. Of course, your posts will be shared there, so why not include those mentions? Bridgy is such a bridge builder. It connects your blog with the big social media players: The only thing you have to do, is to allow Bridgy to access your social media data, like your Tweets on Twitter. If somebody mentions you and one of your articles as a Tweet, Reply or Like, it sends a mention to the endpoint defined in your HTML, in our case webmention.io. Thats it … kinda magic. SummarySome people say, Webmentions makes commenting forms on blogs, like Disqus or others, obsolete, but I don’t agree with that, because not every visitor owns a blog and not every blog owner want’s to write a post only to comment the thoughts of another blogger. Both approaches work well side by side and complement each other. Webmentions are super to build a blog network and increasing your blogs coverage. As I said in Part 1 … we write for readers.

But what makes Facebook, Twitter and others “social” is the interaction between the people. Likes, Retweets, Mentions, Replies are the fuel which drives them. But most of the blogging solutions offers only rudimentary interactions, in form of article comments. The comment hurdle is high because interacting on someone else’s site is different from interacting on what is supposed to be your own, such as your Twitter or Facebook feed.

But what makes Facebook, Twitter and others “social” is the interaction between the people. Likes, Retweets, Mentions, Replies are the fuel which drives them. But most of the blogging solutions offers only rudimentary interactions, in form of article comments. The comment hurdle is high because interacting on someone else’s site is different from interacting on what is supposed to be your own, such as your Twitter or Facebook feed. The project IndieWeb and their approach of Webmentions, has the goal to fill this gap. As a W3C recommendation, it defines standards how the social interaction of independent blogging solutions can be technically implemented without the need of manual intervention. Let software do the job… In this article I will only briefly go into the basics and then show an implementation solution for the SSG Hexo. Basic ConceptsNothing describes the flow of Webmentions better than this: Frankie posts a blog entry. Alex has thoughts in response, so also posts a blog entry linking to Frankie’s. Alex’s publishing software finds the link and fetches Frankie’s post, finding the URL of Frankie’s Webmention endpoint in the document. Alex’s software sends a notification to the endpoint. Frankie’s software then fetches Alex’s post to verify that it really does link back, and then chooses how to display the reaction alongside Frankie’s post. --- Drew McLellan Basically Webmentions allow notifications between web addresses, therefore every post, which is part of the interaction, has to have a unique permalink. A blog software that wants to support webmentions must cover 4 main points: The HTML has to tell others who you are The HTML has to give dedicated informations about your posts Sending a message to another blog, in case you mentioned one of its posts Reveiving messages from other blogs, in case they mentioned one of your posts Point 4 is probably the most interesting for all of us, because it pats our own ego on the back, since we usually don’t write for ourselves, but for others, and reactions to it, show us that it wasn’t pointless. Step 1: The Personal &amp; Profile HTMLAs you want to interact with other blogs participating in the IndieWeb with your posts, they have to know something about you and your articles in a machine-readable form. Personal InformationHTML is machine-readable per se, but you have to tell others what to look for by adding defined classes to the tags which holds the information, in order to enable them to get specific information about you, like your name, your mail-address or links to other profiles f.e. Github, Twitter and so on. It is necessary to have this information not only in an ABOUT page, but also on each post page. You can achieve this either by having an ABOUT block like here on kiko.io or providing the information in hidden HTML tags elsewhere in your HTML. It does not matter which tags you use, you only have to add the defined class to the tag of a particular information in your Hexo EJS file. The information will be extracted out of the tag’s inner text. The most used classes for personal blogs as follows: Class Information h-card Wrapper for all personal information. All other classes below has to be used on child tags p-name Full name u-email Email address u-photo Photo p-role Role u-url URL representing the person p-locality City or Town p-region State or province p-country-name Country name Please keep in mind not to give too much information about you to the public. It could get unpleasant… Profile InformationFor providing links to other profiles, anchor (A) tags with the special attribute rel=&quot;me&quot; will be used, which indicates profile equivalence and can be used for identity-consolidation. With this extension of your blog HTML, you are able to sign in using your domain at sites which supports Web Sign-In over the concept of RelMeAuth, for example those who use IndieAuth.net - OAuth for the open web. You only have to make sure, that the endpoints of your profile links have backlinks to your blog with a rel=&quot;me“. Unfortunately, not many services offer the definition of such a backlink. Github, for example, is an exception. You can give it a try at IndieAuth.com. Example Step 2: The Article HTMLTagging articles with meta information for the IndieWeb is similarly simple, by adding following classes in your article.ejs file: Class Information h-entry Wrapper for all article related information p-name Title p-summary Short summary e-content Content dt-published Publish date dt-updated Update date u-url Permalink In case you work with the default Hexo theme ‘landscape’, I advise you to split your article.ejs in two files, because it is used for the article itself and for the excerpts on the start page and archive pages also. I have made an excerpt.ejs with all the information needed for listing the posts and cut back my article.ejs to the bare minimum, but with the IndieWeb related classes above (or in the linked partials if necessary), because only the article page itself should have these informations, respectively an h-entry class, to indicate that there are IndieWeb data! layout/_partial/article.ejs123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536&lt;article id=&quot;&lt;%= post.layout %&gt;-&lt;%= post.slug %&gt;&quot; class=&quot;article article-type-&lt;%= post.layout %&gt; h-entry&quot; itemscope itemprop=&quot;blogPost&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;article-meta&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;h-card p-author&quot; style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;u-photo&quot; src=&quot;&lt;%- config.photo %&gt;&quot; alt=&quot;&lt;%- config.author %&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;p-name u-url&quot; href=&quot;&lt;%- config.url %&gt;&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;%- config.author %&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/date&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-date dt-published&#x27;, date_format: &#x27;DD MMM YYYY&#x27; &#125;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/category&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-category p-category&#x27; &#125;) %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;article-inner&quot;&gt; &lt;header class=&quot;article-header&quot;&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/title&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-title p-name&#x27;, show_link: false &#125;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/subtitle&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-subtitle p-summary&#x27; &#125;) %&gt; &lt;/header&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;article-entry e-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;%- post.content %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;footer class=&quot;article-footer&quot;&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/tag&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-tags&#x27; &#125;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/permalink&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-permalink u-url&#x27; &#125;) %&gt; &lt;/footer&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/comments&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/related&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/nav&#x27;) %&gt;&lt;/article&gt; External LinksThe Interaction with other blogs takes place through linking to those external sources in the content of your article. Lets say you want to write about a specific topic and to mention the work of another developer, then you just place a link to his post in your Markdown, as you have been doing all along: /source/_posts/my-fancy-post.md1234# My Fancy Post...Jack has done a wonderful job with his [Awesome Work](https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work)... It will be transformed while generating into something like that: /output/.../my-fancy-post/index.html123456789101112131415161718192021&lt;body&gt; ... &lt;article class=&quot;h-entry&quot;&gt; ... &lt;div class=&quot;article-inner&quot;&gt; &lt;header class=&quot;article-header&quot;&gt; &lt;h1 class=&quot;p-name&quot;&gt;My Fancy Post&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/header&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;article-entry e-content&quot;&gt; ... &lt;p&gt; Jack has done a wonderful job with his &lt;a href=&quot;https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work&quot;&gt;Awesome Work&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; ... &lt;/article&gt; ...&lt;/body&gt; In the terms of the IndieWeb concept, your post will a be an article, which mentions other posts, as the old-fashioned pingbacks do. Special Post FormatsA true interaction takes place, when you are posting in a certain syndication context … with a note as a response to the work of others, mainly by adding additional classes to the external link: u-in-reply-to … to indicate that your post is a reply to a post as part of a conversation u-like-of … to indicate that your post is a like u-repost-of … to indicate that your post is a repost (100% re-publication) u-bookmark-of … to indicate that your post is a bookmark Every response type can have additional information about your post and the syndication of it. Example REPLY12345678910111213&lt;body&gt; ... &lt;div class=&quot;h-entry&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt; In reply to: &lt;a class=&quot;u-in-reply-to&quot; href=&quot;https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work&quot;&gt;Jacks Blog: Awesome Work&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p-name e-content&quot;&gt; Jack, you have done a wonderful job! &lt;/p&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; ...&lt;/body&gt; Example LIKE12345678910&lt;body&gt; ... &lt;div class=&quot;h-entry&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p-summary&quot;&gt; Kristof liked &lt;a class=&quot;u-like-of&quot; href=&quot;https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work&quot;&gt;Jacks Awesome Work at https://jacks-blog.com/awesome-work&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; ...&lt;/body&gt; Currently, I would not recommend writing responses as a normal post in Hexo, as it is based on structured text, that best describes the IndieWeb concept of an ARTICLE.As this post is part of a new series called IndieWeb, I will post a solution for responses is the near future.

Don’t miss Part 2: Hexo and the IndieWeb (Sending Webmentions) … TerminologyThere are a lot of posts out there which explains the basic concepts of the IndieWeb and Webmentions in particular and you will stumble upon some terms, which has to be explained: Personal Domain … is a domain name that you personally own, control, and use to represent yourself on the internet. Getting a personal domain is the first step towards getting on the indieweb, and is therefore a requirement for IndieMark Level 1 --- indieweb.org (Personal Domain) Microformats … are small patterns of HTML to represent commonly published things like people, events, blog posts, reviews and tags in web pages. They are the quickest &amp; simplest way to provide an API to the information on your website. --- microformats.org (Wiki) POSSE … is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere, the practice of posting content on your own site first, then publishing copies or sharing links to third parties (like social media silos) with original post links to provide viewers a path to directly interacting with your content. --- indieweb.org (POSSE) Backfeed … is the process of syndicating interactions on your POSSE copies back (AKA reverse syndicating) to your original posts. --- indieweb.org (Backfeed) Web sign-in … is signing in to websites using your personal web address (without having to use your e-mail address). Web sign-in supersedes OpenID. --- indieweb.org (Web sign-in) RelMeAuth … is a proposed open standard for using rel=”me” links to profiles on oauth supporting services to authenticate via either those profiles or your own site. RelMeAuth is the technology behind Web sign-in. --- microformats.org (RelMeAuth) IndieAuth … is a federated login protocol for Web sign-in, enabling users to use their own domain to sign in to other sites and services. --- indieweb.org (IndieAuth) More Info A List Apart: Webmentions: Enabling Better Communication on the Internetindieweb.org: Getting Startedindieweb.org: How to set up web sign-in on your own domainindieweb.org: IndieWeb ExamplesBryce Wray: Webmentions in three SSGs: Part 1Keith J.

Ok then … make a successor on your own, fella… Basic FunctionalityLet me describe how the original plugin and my successor are working in general: Assume, you have several posts from different authors and you want a list of all posts for every author. The only thing you have to do (after installation and configuration of the plugin), is to add a custom variable called author to the FrontMatter of each post, with the name of the author as value. /source/_posts/my-fancy-post.md1234title: My Fancy Postdate: 2021-04-25 13:41:46author: Kristof... Next time you run hexo generate, several new files will be available in your output folder: One INDEX page … for the author index, with a list of all available authors and the number of the posts: /authors/index.html Many POSTS pages …, one for each author for the author index, with all of the authors posts: /authors/kristof/index.html /authors/ … /index.html New Plugin NameIn order to avoid confusion (and be able to provide the plugin on Github/NPM) I needed a new name for the plugin and due to the fact that it is a generator, I named it simply hexo-generator-anything. New FeaturesThe original code was really hard to read, because every second variable was named ‘index’, therefore I started with some refactorings, before I continued implementing new features. ConfigurationThe original, one-dimensional variable to index mapping, wasn’t meaningful enough for me. The new mapping is now a dictionary and has unique identifiers: /_config.yml123456anything: layout_index: anything-index layout_posts: anything-posts index_mappings: - variable: author path: authors The template* setting names has changed into layout_*, to make more clear what they are meant for. They are pointing to an existing EJS file in your Hexo themes layout folder to render the particular page. layout_indexEJS file (without extension) to render the INDEX page layout_PostsEJS file (without extension) to render each POSTS page On Github and in the NPM package you will find sample EJS files and some partials, to take the SoC pattern into account. The original titleSeparator setting is not longer available, because it is not necessary anymore. By providing a data structure for index with the attributes name and caption, a title can be put together in the EJS file itself. Introducing linked Markdown filesOne of my needs was, to provide more information on the INDEX page and the POSTS pages for each entry or, to stay with the example, for each author. As the _posts folder is used for storing the post data files, I introduced a _anything folder for dropping MD files, which are linked to the index and its values. The subfolders of _anything are representing the index and the files in it each possible value of the index. The file is structured like any other post file: the FrontMatter data at the top and below some content to show along with the the entry to describe it: /source/_anything/authors/kristof.md1234567---title: Kristofgithub: https://github.com/kristofzerbeavatar: kristof.png---... some smart things to say about Kristof, or links or images, whatever ... The INDEX file itself may have its own Markdown file, to provide addition text or data to it, like describing the list. The variable title is a requirement in the Markdown files, but you can add as many variables as you need and use it in the EJS files. All data will be passed through to the template. ConclusionThe new plugin runs very well and it is heavy in use on generating the sections Series and Projects of this blog.

In this post I will show you how to implement such a filter in terms of API keys and IP addresses. The SettingsLets start with the list of clients, who should be able to access the data. The most useful place for this is in the appsettings.json of the Core 5.0 Web API project: appsettings.json123456789101112131415...&quot;Callers&quot;: [ &#123; &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;ApiKey&quot;: null, &quot;IPAddress&quot;: &quot;::1&quot; &#125;, &#123; &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;, &quot;ApiKey&quot;: &quot;mytopsecretapikeyforjohndoe&quot;, &quot;IPAddress&quot;: &quot;*&quot; &#125; ]... This list has two entries: one for the server itself (“localhost”), which is restricted to the local IP address &quot;::1&quot;, and one for the test user &quot;John Doe&quot;, who can access from any IP address (&quot;*&quot;), but must supply his personal API key with his requests. In order to handle this setting, we have to introduce it to the system at startup as a class: CallerSetting.cs123456public class CallerSetting&#123; public string Name &#123; get; set; &#125; public string ApiKey &#123; get; set; &#125; public string IPAddress &#123; get; set; &#125;&#125; Startup.cs1234567891011...public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) &#123; ... IConfigurationSection configSection = Configuration.GetSection(&quot;Callers&quot;); services.Configure&lt;List&lt;CallerSetting&gt;&gt;(configSection);&#125;... The ControllerLet’s assume we have a controller, which handles the API requests, like this: MyFancyController.cs123456789101112131415using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;namespace MyAPIProject&#123; [Route(&quot;api/helloworld&quot;)] [ApiController] public class MyFancyAPIController : ControllerBase &#123; [HttpGet] public string Get() &#123; return &quot;Hello World&quot;; &#125; &#125;&#125; To prevent to write a request check against our new settings in each action method, we can decorate the whole controller class by introducing an new custom Attribute, which will do the work: MyFancyController.cs1234567...[Route(&quot;api/helloworld&quot;)][ApiController][AuthenticateApiRequest]public class MyFancyAPIController : ControllerBase...

In this article I want to show you my approach on this… My solution is based on a template system that I implemented into my project at an earlier stage. If you are interested in how this works, I recommend you read my article Utilize a repository of reusable ES6 template literals. Let’s start with the standard scaffold of an HTML5 app, extended with some style‘s, an initialization script and a lonely main element, we want to fill with some localized content: index.html1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;language&quot; content=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;Native JavaScript Multilanguage Templating&lt;/title&gt; &lt;style&gt; body &#123; padding: 2rem; &#125; main &#123; text-align: center; &#125; &lt;/style&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt; import &#123; App &#125; from &#x27;./app.js&#x27;; window.app = new App(); app.init(); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;main&gt;&lt;/main&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; The script points to the following ES6 module class in the file app.js: app.js1234567891011class App &#123; constructor() &#123; // do something when the class is instantiated &#125; init() &#123; // do something to initialize the app &#125;&#125;export &#123; App &#125;; Nothing uncommon so far, if you are familiar with ES6 classes and imports/exports. Now let’s create a localizations.js file, to store the needed localized strings in all wanted languages. Every language will have its own branch in a Localizations object, represented by its two-letter ISO-639-1 language code. All translations are accessible via an unique english key word: localizations.js12345678910111213141516171819202122export function Localizations() &#123; return &#123; &quot;EN&quot;: &#123; &quot;helloWorld&quot;: &quot;Hello World&quot; &#125;, &quot;DE&quot;: &#123; &quot;helloWorld&quot;: &quot;Hallo Welt&quot; &#125;, &quot;ES&quot;: &#123; &quot;helloWorld&quot;: &quot;Hola, mundo&quot; &#125;, &quot;FR&quot;: &#123; &quot;helloWorld&quot;: &quot;Bonjour le monde&quot; &#125;, &quot;RU&quot;: &#123; &quot;helloWorld&quot;: &quot;Здравствуйте, мир&quot; &#125;, &quot;JP&quot;: &#123; &quot;helloWorld&quot;: &quot;ハローワールド&quot; &#125; &#125;&#125; As we import the localizations.js in our app.js, we can initialize the localizations in the constructor of the app class with the language code of the users browser: app.js12345678910111213141516import &#123; Localizations &#125; from &#x27;./localizations.js&#x27;;class App &#123; constructor() &#123; // Get browser language this.langCode = window.navigator.language.split(&quot;-&quot;)[0].toUpperCase(); // Init localization to access via &#x27;app.localization&#x27; globally this.localization = Localizations()[this.langCode]; &#125; ... app.localization now holds the key/value list of the current language. Now we implement the templating class, as described in Utilize a repository of reusable ES6 template literals and define a first template called helloWorld … templates.js123456789101112131415class Templates &#123; helloWorld(data) &#123; return this.fillTemplate(` &lt;h1&gt;$&#123;app.localization.helloWorld&#125;&lt;/h1&gt; `, data); &#125; fillTemplate(templateString, templateVars)&#123; var func = new Function(...Object.keys(templateVars), &quot;return `&quot; + templateString + &quot;`;&quot;); return func(...Object.values(templateVars)); &#125;&#125;export &#123; Templates &#125;; The inner text of the h1 element in the helloWorld template refers to the globally available variable app.localization, we initialized in the last step, and points to the translation helloWorld. In app.js we import the templates.js and implement some code in the init method, to get the template and bring it to the DOM: app.js1234567891011121314151617import &#123; Localizations &#125; from &#x27;./localizations.js&#x27;;import &#123; Templates &#125; from &#x27;./templates.js&#x27;;class App &#123; ... init() &#123; // Get &quot;Hello World&quot; H1 element in current language let helloWorld = app.templates.helloWorld(&#123;&#125;); //Insert H1 element into MAIN element document.querySelector(&quot;main&quot;) .insertAdjacentHTML(&quot;beforeend&quot;, helloWorld); &#125; This is it … In the following Github repository you will find a solution based on this example, extented with a language selector, cookie support and some helper methods to keep the code nice and clean: https://github.com/kristofzerbe/Native-JavaScript-Multilanguage-Templating","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Localization","slug":"Localization","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Localization/"},{"name":"ES6","slug":"ES6","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/ES6/"},{"name":"Templating","slug":"Templating","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Templating/"}]},{"title":"Remote Testing and Debugging with Chrome","subtitle":"How to test a local site on a mobile device and debug it locally","date":"2021-01-24","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/Remote-Testing-and-Debugging-with-Chrome/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Remote-Testing-and-Debugging-with-Chrome/","excerpt":"Developing a website or web app means, you have installed an editor locally on your computer, writing your code locally and start a tiny, built-in web server for debugging locally in your preferred browser.

Should be the same technique as that of a reflection. Here is the HTML/CSS code for it, as the people asking for it in the comments. What we want to achieve is this: Basically, we use a duplicate of the image and position it below the actual image, but slightly offset and blurred. It won’t be a performance issue, as some might think, because it is the very same file and will be loaded only once by the browser. For showing two images in the nearly same place in different layers, we need a wrapper… 1234&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;my-image.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;shadow&quot; src=&quot;my-image.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; … and some CSS for positioning the images on top of each other first. Here are the defaults for both image elements: 123456789101112div.image-wrapper &#123; position: relative;&#125;div.image-wrapper img &#123; position: absolute; display: block; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; z-index: 1;&#125; Now we have to style the duplicate image that it looks similar to the shadow. We washing it out using the blur filter and the opacity. 1234div.image-wrapper img.shadow &#123; filter: blur(10px); opacity: 0.8;&#125; Last step is to change the duplicates dimensions and the positioning below the original image. We squeeze it by 10% and shift it from left with half of the value back to the center, shift it from top to make it standout at the bottom and send it to the back by taking a lower z-index than the original image. 123456789div.image-wrapper img.shadow &#123; filter: blur(10px); opacity: 0.8; width: 90%; left: 5%; top: 40px; z-index: 0;&#125; Thats it.

You HTML code maybe looks like this: 123456789101112131415161718&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;...

The solution is to find and remove all appropriate classes at once, for example by using RegEx and a reusable helper function: 12345678910function removeClassByPrefix(el, prefix) &#123; let pattern = &#x27;(&#x27; + prefix + &#x27;(\\\\s|(-)?(\\\\w*)(\\\\s)?)).*?&#x27;; var regEx = new RegExp(pattern, &#x27;g&#x27;); el.className = el.className.replace(regEx, &#x27;&#x27;);&#125;//...let sidebar = document.getElementById(&quot;sidebar&quot;);removeClassByPrefix(sidebar, &quot;open&quot;); Update, 24 Jan 2021The first posted RegEx pattern didn’t worked properly, because it has found the prefix only and not the whole word, so I have updated the pattern.

Therefore the name template literals is a bit misleading. But … there is a way to achieve this anyway… Tagged TemplatesBeside Template Literals, ES6 introduced Tagged Templates (exact: Tagged Template Literals). These tags are functions, which allows you to parse a Template Literal. Definition is like this: 123function myTag(literals, ...expressions) &#123; //do the substitution and return a string&#125; You can use these tags by prefixing you literal: 1myTag`Hello $&#123;firstName&#125; $&#123;lastName&#125;!` Using Tagged Templates to build a template repository would mean, you have to write one tag function for every template … doable, but time consuming. Dynamic Tag FunctionTo avoid this, we can write a universal tag function, which utilizes the Function constructor, to create the tag function dynamically: 12345678function fillTemplate(templateString, templateVars) &#123; var func = new Function( ...Object.keys(templateVars), &quot;return `&quot; + templateString + &quot;`;&quot;) return func(...Object.values(templateVars));&#125; Don’t use this approach on user inputs as expressions, to avoid XSS!

My workflow for quite some time is to publish my photos on the hard drive, in a folder, which is synced via Dropbox with the cloud. From there I distribute them further. Important on this approach is, to have a coherent output folder structure in order find a particular image afterwards. I store my RAW images on an external hard drive in a structure like this: 1234&lt;Drive:\\&gt; -&gt; Fotos -&gt; &lt;Year&gt; -&gt; &lt;Year&gt;-&lt;Month&gt; &lt;Eventname&gt; First step after shooting is to copy all RAW files from the SD Card into a new subfolder of the current year. From there I import them into my Lightroom catalog. After sorting, rejecting, editing and flagging in Lightroom, I have to “export” the 4- and 5-star rated images into the cloud. There I have a slightly different structure, with a different root folder name and without the year: 123&lt;Dropbox&gt; -&gt; Photos -&gt; &lt;Year&gt;-&lt;Month&gt; &lt;Eventname&gt; With the built-in “Hard Drive” publish service of Lightroom, it is feasible to “export” the images, but not in my wanted folder structure, because it is not possible to use the sources’ folder name as output folder name by option. It has to be specified manually each time, which is not very comfortable. Plugin to the rescueJeffrey Friedl, who is in the Lightroom plugin business about a decade, offers two plugins, which can solve the problem easily: Jeffrey’s “Folder Publisher“ Lightroom PluginExports to disk in a folder hierarchy that mimics the folder hierarchy in your Lightroom catalog This one helps me not much, because my output folder would look like this: 12345&lt;Dropbox&gt; -&gt; Photos -&gt; Fotos -&gt; &lt;Year&gt; -&gt; &lt;Year&gt;-&lt;Month&gt; &lt;Eventname&gt; Jeffrey’s “Collection Publisher” Lightroom PluginExports to local disk in a folder hierarchy that mimics the collection hierarchy you build within Lightroom Besides the commonality of defining a root folder, where the files are exported to, Jeffrey’s plugin has much more options to improve the export. As the main feature, you can create collections within the plugin to define the export targets: In the options of these collections, you can set several templates (variables) to let the plugin name the export subfolder automatically: By using Smart Collections you don’t even need to drag &amp; drop your images to publish to the publish collection. Lightroom will do this auto-magically.","categories":[{"name":"Photo-Editing","slug":"Photo-Editing","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Photo-Editing/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Lightroom","slug":"Lightroom","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Lightroom/"},{"name":"Publishing","slug":"Publishing","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Publishing/"},{"name":"Plugin","slug":"Plugin","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Plugin/"}]},{"title":"Discoveries #4","subtitle":null,"series":"Discoveries","date":"2020-10-10","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/Discoveries-4/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Discoveries-4/","excerpt":"It is so amazing how many cool stuff developers around the world are producing these days.

In the default Hexo theme Landscape, on which this blog is based, there is no such function built in, but as the Hexo community is very busy, there are some plugins you can use. Plugin: hexo-list-related-postsThis plugin, available at GitHub is pretty lean and generates a list of links to related posts based on tags. It just counts how often a tag is occuring and shows a list of related posts either by count descending or randomly. Advantage: Easy and fast Disadvantage: Necessity of a sophisticated tag system Technical approach Plugin: hexo-related-postsSergey Zwezdin made much more effort in his solution. The plugins depends on statistic methodologies like Stemming and TF/IDF, provided by the Node library Natural. It has plenty setting options like weighting and reserved words in order to optimize results. Advantages: Much better results Disadvantages: Huge installation, because of many dependent Node modules Necessity of maintaining reserved words Technical approach Manually CuratedOne point, that no technical solution can achieve is: you can guide the reader through your blog, by pointing out posts, which doesn’t really belong to the topic, but tries to give him a wider perspective on your thoughts or work. This is only possible, if you link the related posts manually. Here is a way to implement the requirements… The right place to store related posts is in the Frontmatter of your article. Create a list below the keyword related and take the slug (name of the post file) of the posts you want to show below the article as entries: 12345title: My New fancy Postrelated: - my-other-post - one-of-my-first-posts - yet-another-post In your article.ejs add a new partial called related to the place where it should be shown under the content of the actual article: 123456789101112131415161718192021&lt;article id=&quot;&lt;%= post.layout %&gt;-&lt;%= post.slug %&gt;&quot; class=&quot;article article-type-&lt;%= post.layout %&gt;&quot; itemscope itemprop=&quot;blogPost&quot;&gt; ... &lt;div class=&quot;article-inner&quot;&gt; &lt;%- post.content %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;% if (!index)&#123; %&gt; &lt;!-- NEW RELATED PARTIAL --&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/related&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/comments&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/nav&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;% &#125; %&gt;&lt;/article&gt; In the folder themes/landscape/layout/_partial/post, where all partials are stored which belongs to posts, create the new partial file: related.ejs12345678910111213141516171819202122232425&lt;% if (post.related &amp;&amp; post.related.length)&#123; %&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;article-related&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Related&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;archives&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- Loop through the Frontmatter list of RELATED posts --&gt; &lt;% post.related.forEach(function(item) &#123; %&gt; &lt;!--Determine the post(s) with the given slug --&gt; &lt;% var posts = site.posts.filter(function(post) &#123; return post.slug.toLowerCase() === item.toLowerCase(); &#125;); %&gt; &lt;!-- Loop through the post(s) and render the archive panel --&gt; &lt;% posts.each(function(post) &#123; %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;../archive-post&#x27;, &#123; post: post, show_link: true &#125;) %&gt; &lt;% &#125;); %&gt; &lt;% &#125;); %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;% &#125; %&gt; (Remove the comments, because they doesn’t belong to EJS) In this partial we loop through the Frontmatter list of related posts, determine the post by the given slug and render an archive panel for each post.

Now you can read out this value via JavaScript by getting the styles of the tag and get the injected content: 12var style = window.getComputedStyle(document.querySelector(&quot;body&quot;), &quot;:before&quot;);var breakpoint = style.getPropertyValue(&quot;content&quot;).replace(/\\&quot;/g, &quot;&quot;); It is advisable to embed this request into an event listener of DOMContentLoaded, because the rule has to be set, before you can access it.

Not optimal and should be solved by an own Hexo page, because GitHub Pages allows you to deliver a custom 404 page by creating simply a 404.html in the root of the website. As you can create separate pages in Hexo, this is done quickly by: 1hexo new page &quot;404&quot; It generates a new folder named 404 in your source folder, where a index.md is placed. In this file you can enter the text as Markdown you want to show to the user, in case of a 404 error (page not found) occurs. On generating the static files by hexo generate, a subfolder 404 with a index.html will be created, which doesn’t really work with GitHub Pages, because it needs a 404.htm in the root.

Not the One-Click experience I prefer. My goal was to show the permalink and, even more important, provide a simple way to copy and to share. JavaScript to the rescue… DisplayAs I run my blog with Hexo, I deal with EJS files. To show the permalink in my article.ejs, was quite simple. First step was to create a new partial file named permalink.ejs, to be called every time when the complete article has to be rendered: 123&lt;% if (!index)&#123; %&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/permalink&#x27;, &#123; class_name: &#x27;article-permalink&#x27; &#125;) %&gt;&lt;% &#125; %&gt; The partial file looked like this in this step: 123&lt;div class=&quot;&lt;%= class_name %&gt;&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;a id=&quot;article-permalink&quot; href=&quot;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; CopyAs I read a little bit about the possibilities to copy text into the clipboard via JavaScript on MDN, it became obvious that a link is not the best solution, because using the exeCommand needs to have something selected and this is difficult on anchors. Then … do it with an input: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627&lt;div class=&quot;&lt;%= class_name %&gt;&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;article-permalink&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;a id=&quot;action-copy&quot; class=&quot;article-action&quot; href=&quot;javascript:copyPermalink();&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt; var copyText = document.querySelector(&quot;#article-permalink&quot;); //Disable Input by default copyText.disabled = true; function copyPermalink() &#123; //Enable Input copyText.disabled = false; //Select permalink text copyText.select(); //Copy to clipboard document.execCommand(&quot;copy&quot;); //Remove selection again copyText.blur(); //Disable Input again copyText.disabled = true; &#125;&lt;/script&gt; Nice, but a user feedback, that the text has been copied to the clipboard, was advisable, because nothing is more annoying, when you click somewhere and nothing seems to happen. As I hate default browser confirmations and other distracting messaging methods, I wanted to use the input itself, by fading out the link text, replace it with a message and fade in the text again: I extended my animation.styl (Hexo works with Stylus) with two keyframe animations … one for fading in, one for fading out… 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425@keyframes fadeIn &#123; 0% &#123; opacity:0; &#125; 100% &#123; opacity:1; &#125;&#125;.fade-in-500 animation: fadeIn ease 0.5s;.fade-in-1000 animation: fadeIn ease 1s;@keyframes fadeOut &#123; 0% &#123; opacity:1; &#125; 100% &#123; opacity:0; &#125;&#125;.fade-out-500 animation: fadeOut ease 0.5s;.fade-out-1000 animation: fadeOut ease 1s; … and wrote a setTimeout cascade to achive the effect: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152&lt;div class=&quot;&lt;%= class_name %&gt;&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;article-permalink&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;article-action action-copy&quot; href=&quot;javascript:copyPermalink();&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt; var copyText = document.querySelector(&quot;#article-permalink&quot;); copyText.disabled = true; function copyPermalink() &#123; copyText.disabled = false; copyText.select(); document.execCommand(&quot;copy&quot;); copyText.blur(); copyText.disabled = true; //Store original text var permalink = copyText.value; //Start fading out copyText.classList.add(&quot;fade-out-500&quot;); //Wait until animation is done setTimeout(function()&#123; //Set message, remove fadout class and add start fading in copyText.value = &quot;copied to clipboard&quot;; copyText.classList.remove(&quot;fade-out-500&quot;); copyText.classList.add(&quot;fade-in-1000&quot;); //Wait 2 seconds to show the message setTimeout(function() &#123; //Start to fade out message copyText.classList.add(&quot;fade-out-500&quot;); //Wait until animation is done setTimeout(function() &#123; //Set original text again and remove fadout class copyText.value = permalink; copyText.classList.remove(&quot;fade-out-500&quot;); //Wait until animation is done setTimeout(function() &#123; //Remove fadeout class copyText.classList.remove(&quot;fade-in-1000&quot;); &#125;, 500); &#125;, 500); &#125;, 2000); &#125;, 500); &#125;&lt;/script&gt; ShareThe second permalink feature was a little bit trickier, because I didn’t want to use one of the sharing libraries out there, whose business model is based on my readers data (always keep conservative on implementing third party stuff, because you never know what they are doing with the data). But a couple of months ago I read about a new native browser API for WebApps on the rise: Web Share API. Since 2019 W3C is working on this API, for sharing text, links and other content to an arbitrary destination of the user’s choice. On 27 August 2020 the published a Working Draft and on 16 September 2020 the latest Editors Draft. Brand new stuff. The browser support is not the best yet, but it will be getting better in the near feature, especially as Edge Chrome is one of the early adopters. web.dev lists important requirements on using this new feature in JavaScript: It can only be used on a site that supports HTTPS It must be invoked in response to a user action such as a click But it can share URL’s, text and even files! A raw implementation can be: 12345678910if (navigator.share === undefined) &#123; navigator.share(&#123; title: &#x27;My Post&#x27;, url: &#x27;https://my-domain.com/my-url&#x27;, &#125;) .then(() =&gt; console.log(&#x27;Successful share&#x27;)) .catch((error) =&gt; console.log(&#x27;Error sharing&#x27;, error));&#125; else &#123; // fallback&#125; I refrain to implement a fallback, rather I would like to show the appropriate button only to those users, whose browser supports it: 12345678910111213141516171819202122&lt;div class=&quot;&lt;%= class_name %&gt;&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;article-permalink&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&quot; data-id=&quot;&lt;%= post._id %&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;a id=&quot;action-copy&quot; class=&quot;article-action&quot; href=&quot;javascript:copyPermalink();&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a id=&quot;action-share&quot; class=&quot;article-action&quot; href=&quot;javascript:sharePermalink();&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt; function copyPermalink() &#123; -- SEE ABOVE &#125; if (navigator.share === undefined) &#123; var shareLink = document.querySelector(&quot;#action-share&quot;); shareLink.style.display = &quot;none&quot;; &#125; function sharePermalink() &#123; navigator.share(&#123; title: &quot;&lt;%- post.title %&gt;&quot;, url: &quot;&lt;%- post.permalink %&gt;&quot;, &#125;) &#125;&lt;/script&gt; More Info w3c.github.io: W3C Web Share Testheise Developer: Features von übermorgen: Die Web Share API und die Web Share Target API (German)CSS-Tricks: How to Use the Web Share API","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"CSS","slug":"CSS","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/CSS/"},{"name":"Stylus","slug":"Stylus","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Stylus/"},{"name":"Share","slug":"Share","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Share/"}]},{"title":"Discoveries #2","subtitle":null,"series":"Discoveries","date":"2020-09-07","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/Discoveries-2/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Discoveries-2/","excerpt":"New month, new discoveries.

The following approach works best in the Google Chrome browser. First, a Bookmarklet is a small piece of JavaScript, which is stored as a bookmark in your browser. As you can’t actually create such a Bookmarklet in your Android Chrome, you have to create it in your desktop Chrome and switch on the bookmark sync of chrome. You should right away choose a short, concise name for the bookmark, so you find it easier in Android Chrome afterwards. I called it 2TrelloCard, because few websites start with an number. After Chrome’s sync is done, go to any website do you want to store as a Trello card. Now enter the Url box and type the name of the bookmarklet and select it. Instead of requesting a different page, Chrome executes the JavaScript of the Bookmarklet against the currently open website. This script shows a Trello dialog, where you can choose, which board and list the new card should be created on. This card creation method not only sets the title of the card, but fills the description with the meta description of the page, adds the first found meta image as cover and adds the Url as an attachment:","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Trello","slug":"Trello","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Trello/"},{"name":"Browser","slug":"Browser","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Browser/"}]},{"title":"Horizontal navigation menu above an image","subtitle":"How to deal with coverage, readability and scrollbars","series":"A New Blog","date":"2020-07-20","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/Horizontal-navigation-menu-above-an-image/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Horizontal-navigation-menu-above-an-image/","excerpt":"I changed the main menu of my blog, because I wanted to get rid of the hamburger menu on the upper left, which was shown only for smartphones, but was not really reachable conveniently.

As I have quite big header images and I wanted to place the new navigation in a more accessible zone, I decided to place it at the bottom, but above the header image. Problem was, not to cover a big part of the image with a full-colored or even semitransparent bar, by using a RGBA background color. I wanted it more translucent, but with enough contrast on bright images for the menu items to read. The recently introduced W3C feature backdrop-filter was just the right thing for that. It is supported by most modern browsers, but it has to have a backup strategy for the rest of the bunch. The HTML is simple: 1234567891011121314151617&lt;nav id=&quot;header-nav&quot; role=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;menu-item&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/first&quot; title=&quot;First&quot;&gt; &lt;span&gt;First Item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class=&quot;menu-item&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/second&quot; title=&quot;Second&quot;&gt; &lt;span&gt;Second Item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/nav&gt; And here’s the Stylus code for my approach: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142#header-nav position: absolute bottom: 0 width: 100% height: auto box-sizing: content-box overflow-x: scroll overflow-y: hidden // BACKDROP-FILTER backdrop-filter: blur(5px) brightness(90%) @supports not (backdrop-filter: none) background: rgba(0,0,0,0.25) // SCROLLBAR &amp;::-webkit-scrollbar display: none @supports not (webkit-scrollbar) scrollbar-width: none .menu display: flex list-style: none margin: 0 padding: 0 .menu-item flex-basis: 80px flex-shrink: 0 flex-grow: 1 max-width: 100px margin: 0 2px text-overflow: ellipsis; a display: inline-block width: 100% padding: 10px 0 color: #ffffff font-weight: bold text-decoration: none text-align: center The navigation box is absolute positioned on the image, is as wide as the screen and scrolls exclusively horizontal. The items are a unordered list, with default width and arranged by flex. In case a browser doesn’t understand backdrop-filter, the navigation bar is shown with a classic alpha channel opacity. When having a horizontal scroll feature, the scrollbar shown by the browser is beyond beautiful. To prevent this, I used the CSS pseudo element ::-webkit-scrollbar, which is supported by WebKit and Blink bowsers, with a fallback for all other browsers. Both strategies allows to be still able to scroll. If you want to have a scrollbar, but not the built-in, I can only recommend to read something about styling scrollbars, like here and here.","categories":[{"name":"UI-Design","slug":"UI-Design","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/UI-Design/"}],"tags":[{"name":"CSS","slug":"CSS","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/CSS/"},{"name":"Stylus","slug":"Stylus","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Stylus/"}]},{"title":"Change CSS class when element scrolls into viewport","subtitle":null,"series":"A New Blog","date":"2020-07-13","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/Change-CSS-class-when-element-scrolls-into-viewport/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Change-CSS-class-when-element-scrolls-into-viewport/","excerpt":"I had a neat visual gimmick on the start page of this blog, that the gray-scaled header image of a post in the list scaled up to 100% and became colored, when the user hovered over it: 123456789101112131415.article-inner .article-photo &#123; height: 150px; width: 100%; object-fit: cover; transform: scale(1); transform-style: preserve-3d; transition: all ease-out 0.6s; opacity: 0.3; filter: grayscale(1) contrast(0.5);&#125;.article-inner:hover .article-photo &#123; transform: scale(1.1); opacity: 1; filter: grayscale(0) contrast(1);&#125; Nice, but a little bit useless on smartphones or tablets, where HOVER doesn’t really work.","keywords":"neat visual gimmick start page blog gray-scaled header image post list scaled 100% colored user hovered 123456789101112131415article-inner article-photo &#123 height 150px width object-fit cover transform scale1 transform-style preserve-3d transition ease-out 06s opacity filter grayscale1 contrast05&#125article-innerhover scale11 grayscale0 contrast1&#125 nice bit useless smartphones tablets hover doesnt work","text":"I had a neat visual gimmick on the start page of this blog, that the gray-scaled header image of a post in the list scaled up to 100% and became colored, when the user hovered over it: 123456789101112131415.article-inner .article-photo &#123; height: 150px; width: 100%; object-fit: cover; transform: scale(1); transform-style: preserve-3d; transition: all ease-out 0.6s; opacity: 0.3; filter: grayscale(1) contrast(0.5);&#125;.article-inner:hover .article-photo &#123; transform: scale(1.1); opacity: 1; filter: grayscale(0) contrast(1);&#125; Nice, but a little bit useless on smartphones or tablets, where HOVER doesn’t really work.

As I host this blog at GitHub (see A New Blog (Part One): VS Code, Hexo and GitHub Pages) I was looking for a solution to host the comments also on my prefered platform. There were some solutions, which uses GitHub Issues for this and wanted to implement something like that someday. As I read a post from on Thomas Lavesques’ blog, to solve another problem, his commenting section came to my attention: utteranc.es … exactly the solution I needed! Thanx guys… On their website is a small configurator for a script to implement in each post, which needs only few information: Name of the Repo How the mapping of the post to the Issues should work Name of the Theme, in order to fit to the colors of the blog The script had to be included to my Hexo article.js: 123456789&lt;% if (!index &amp;&amp; post.comments)&#123; %&gt; &lt;script src&#x3D;&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;utteranc.es&#x2F;client.js&quot; repo&#x3D;&quot;kristofzerbe&#x2F;kiko.io&quot; issue-term&#x3D;&quot;pathname&quot; theme&#x3D;&quot;github-light&quot; crossorigin&#x3D;&quot;anonymous&quot; async&gt; &lt;&#x2F;script&gt;&lt;% &#125; %&gt; That’s pretty much it. On entering the first comment, Utterances told me to install the needed GitHub App to my repo, in order to make it work … and done. The result you see below … UPDATE…The utterances script tag has the attribute theme, to tell utterances which style should be delivered. There are several themes available, but if users are able to switch between light or dark mode on the page (see Hexo and the Dark Mode), the comment block should change to an suitable theme also. On order to respond on a mode change, it is necessary to write a more dynamic script loading. First we define a function in a global script file to load the utterances script via JS: 1234567891011121314151617181920function insertUtterancesCommentBlock() &#123; var commentTheme = &quot;github-light&quot;; if(localStorage.getItem(&quot;theme&quot;) === &quot;dark&quot;)&#123; commentTheme = &quot;github-dark&quot;; &#125; const scriptId = &quot;comment-theme-script&quot;; const existingScript = document.getElementById(scriptId); if (!existingScript) &#123; const commentScript = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); commentScript.id = scriptId; commentScript.src = &quot;https://utteranc.es/client.js&quot;; commentScript.setAttribute(&quot;repo&quot;, &quot;kristofzerbe/kiko.io&quot;); commentScript.setAttribute(&quot;issue-term&quot;, &quot;pathname&quot;); commentScript.setAttribute(&quot;theme&quot;, commentTheme); commentScript.setAttribute(&quot;crossorigin&quot;, &quot;anonymous&quot;); const placeholder = document.getElementById(&quot;comment-placeholder&quot;); placeholder.innerHTML = &quot;&quot;; placeholder.appendChild(commentScript); &#125;&#125; Then we change the placement in the EJS file, by defining a placeholder and ensuring that the script above is loaded, before we call it: 123456&lt;div id&#x3D;&quot;comment-placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;&lt;script&gt; window.addEventListener(&#39;load&#39;, function () &#123; insertUtterancesCommentBlock(); &#125;)&lt;&#x2F;script&gt; On my blog, everytime the user switches between light/dark mode the body tag will be decorated with the data tag data-theme and the value of the mode. To keep the loading of the utterances script independent from this functionality, we just have to listen to this change via MutationObserver: 12345678910//observe theme change, to adjust comment block themevar target = document.documentElement, observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) &#123; mutations.forEach(function(mutation) &#123; if (mutation.attributionName === &quot;data-theme&quot; ); insertUtterancesCommentBlock(); &#125;); &#125;), config = &#123; attributes: true &#125;;observer.observe(target, config);","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"GitHub","slug":"GitHub","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/GitHub/"},{"name":"Blogging","slug":"Blogging","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Blogging/"}]},{"title":"Meaningful automatic versioning with T4","subtitle":"How to implement versioning in C# projects the better way","date":"2020-06-27","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Meaningful-automatic-versioning-with-T4/","excerpt":"Every developer has to have an idea of versioning his products.

This always should be set manually. Also the MINOR. It stands for significant functional extensions of the product. How does Visual Studio calculate BUILD and REVISION? When specifying a version, you have to at least specify major. If you specify major and minor, you can specify an asterisk for build. This will cause build to be equal to the number of days since January 1, 2000 local time, and for revision to be equal to the number of seconds since midnight local time, divided by 2. But, the BUILD number should explain, how often a software with a particular MAJOR.MINOR has been build, due to minor changes and bug fixes. The “Asterisk” REVISION number is a little weird, but at least with the BUILD number unique. But it says nothing. Better to pick up the idea of a date calculated, unique number, but not an arbitrary date … let’s take the date the project has started. For example: 1.2.16.158 … reads version 1.2 with 16 builds on the 158’th day after the project has started. Start with T4T4 (Text Template Transformation Toolkit) is a templating system in Visual Studio for generating text files during design time. It is very suitable to even generate code. Read about it here and here. A Text Template (.tt) has Directives (how the template is processed), Text blocks (text copied to the output) and Control blocks (program code). For our versioning template, we start with this in a new file named AssemblyVersion.tt: Directives: 12&lt;#@ template hostspecific=&quot;true&quot; language=&quot;C#&quot; #&gt;&lt;#@ output extension=&quot;.cs&quot; #&gt; Control block: 123456&lt;# int major = 1; int minor = 0; int build = 0; int revision = 0;#&gt; Text block: 1234567// This code was generated by a tool. Any changes made manually will be lost// the next time this code is regenerated.using System.Reflection;[assembly: AssemblyVersion(&quot;&lt;#= $&quot;&#123;major&#125;.&#123;minor&#125;.&#123;build&#125;.&#123;revision&#125;&quot; #&gt;&quot;)][assembly: AssemblyFileVersion(&quot;&lt;#= $&quot;&#123;major&#125;.&#123;minor&#125;.&#123;build&#125;.&#123;revision&#125;&quot; #&gt;&quot;)] On saving the TT file, a new CS file with the same name will be created automatically and you got an error like this: A new place for version infoTh error occurs, because we have now two AssemblyVersion and AssemblyFileVersion attributes in our project. We need to comment out the original in Properties\\AssemblyInfo.cs: Structural ConsiderationsIt makes sense to store all needed files for the new versioning system in a new root folder of the project, named AssemblyVersion, starting with the AssemblyVersion.tt, because there will be more files later on. New app information fileAs we replaced the original version attributes in the project with those from our generated AssemblyVersion.cs, we cannot control the MAJOR and MINOR version number via the project property dialog any longer. We need a new approach on that, which can be edited easily and processed automatically. AssemblyVersion.json1234567891011121314151617&#123; &quot;initialDate&quot;: &quot;2019-09-29&quot;, &quot;versions&quot;: [ &#123; &quot;major&quot;: 1, &quot;minor&quot;: 1, &quot;releaseDate&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;remarks&quot;: &quot;Some cool new features; New versioning system&quot; &#125;, &#123; &quot;major&quot;: 1, &quot;minor&quot;: 0, &quot;releaseDate&quot;: &quot;2019-10-01&quot;, &quot;remarks&quot;: &quot;Initial Release&quot; &#125; ]&#125; This new JSON file has two main items: initialDate - the date the project has started, to calculate the REVISION later on versions - a list with all different MAJOR/MINOR versions we have done so far, with at least one without a release date … the one with the highest major and minor. The remarks attribute of a list item holds some information about the changes in a new version. Together with releaseDate, useful for a possible release history, shown in the product itself. Library references in T4T4 runs in its own app domain, therefore it can use built-in libraries as System.IO, but not third-party libraries like Newtonsoft.JSON. We could reference those libraries from the projects package folder via the absolute path (if we use it in our product), but when we are running a NuGet update, the reference will break. It is advisable to store such libraries directly in a fixed folder, like AssemblyVersion\\Libraries. They won’t have any impact to our product, because the are only used while design time. The MAJOR and MINORTo process the new AssemblyVersion.json in the template, we need some new directives for referencing the needed libraries and the import of the appropriate namepaces: 123456&lt;#@ assembly name=&quot;System.Core&quot; #&gt;&lt;#@ assembly name=&quot;$(SolutionDir)\\AssemblyVersion\\Libraries\\Newtonsoft.Json.dll&quot; #&gt;&lt;#@ import namespace=&quot;System.IO&quot; #&gt;&lt;#@ import namespace=&quot;System.Linq&quot; #&gt;&lt;#@ import namespace=&quot;Newtonsoft.Json&quot; #&gt; Via the use of the T4 variable $(SolutionDir), we can point to our copy of Newtonsoft JSON. Now we can read and convert the JSON into an anonymous object and get the highest values of MAJOR and MINOR: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728&lt;# string avPath = this.Host.ResolvePath(&quot;AssemblyVersion.json&quot;); string avJson = File.ReadAllText(avPath); var avDefinition = new &#123; initialDate = &quot;&quot;, versions = new [] &#123; new &#123; major = 0, minor = 0, releaseDate = &quot;&quot;, remarks = &quot;&quot; &#125; &#125; &#125;; var avObject = JsonConvert.DeserializeAnonymousType(avJson, avDefinition); //Get highest Major/Minor from versions list var maxVersion = avObject.versions .OrderByDescending(i =&gt; i.major) .ThenByDescending(j =&gt; j.minor) .First(); //Set MAJOR int major = maxVersion.major; //Set MINOR int minor = maxVersion.minor;#&gt; The BuildLogIn order to get the version number for BUILD, we need a method to count and store every build that has been run, separated by the MAJOR/MINOR versions. This is a job for a Post-build event, which can be configured in the project properties dialog. The event uses shell commands as they are used on the command line. What the commands should do:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write a new line with the current date and time in a log file, named after the MAJOR/MINOR version and stored in the folder AssemblyVersion\\BuildLogs. Extending build event macrosShell commands for build events are supporting built-in variables, so called ‘macros’, like $(ProjectDir) (which returns the project directory path), but there is no such macro for the current version number. We have to introduce it via extending the project with a new build target. Unload the project in Visual Studio for editing the CSPROJ (or VBPROJ) file of your product manually and write the following definition just before the end-tag: 123456789101112131415&lt;PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;PostBuildEventDependsOn&gt; $(PostBuildEventDependsOn); PostBuildMacros; &lt;/PostBuildEventDependsOn&gt;&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;&lt;Target Name=&quot;PostBuildMacros&quot;&gt; &lt;GetAssemblyIdentity AssemblyFiles=&quot;$(TargetPath)&quot;&gt; &lt;Output TaskParameter=&quot;Assemblies&quot; ItemName=&quot;Targets&quot; /&gt; &lt;/GetAssemblyIdentity&gt; &lt;ItemGroup&gt; &lt;VersionNumber Include=&quot;@(Targets-&gt;&#x27;%(Version)&#x27;)&quot; /&gt; &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;&lt;/Target&gt; After reloading the project in Visual Studio, we can use @(VersionNumber) in our commands. CreateBuildLog.batThe event build editor is not very comfortable, so we create the batch file CreateBuildLog.bat in our AssemblyVersion folder and use this as the post build event command. The BuildLog folder must exist, before running the following command the first time! 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627@echo offREM --Get parametersset PROJECT_DIR=%1set VERSION_NUMBER=%2REM --Set what to logset LOG_LINE=%DATE% %TIME%REM --Inform the userset MSG=CreateBuildLog &#x27;%LOG_LINE%&#x27; for version %VERSION_NUMBER%echo %MSG%REM --Get version partsFOR /f &quot;tokens=1,2,3,4 delims=.&quot; %%a IN (&quot;%VERSION_NUMBER%&quot;) do ( set MAJOR=%%a set MINOR=%%b set BUILD=%%c set REVISION=%%d)REM --Define BuildLog file and folder set BUILDLOG_FILE=%MAJOR%.%MINOR%.logset BUILDLOG_FOLDER=%PROJECT_DIR%\\AssemblyVersion\\BuildLogsREM --Write current date and time as new line in the fileecho %LOG_LINE% &gt;&gt; %BUILDLOG_FOLDER%\\%BUILDLOG_FILE%&quot; 1&quot;$(ProjectDir)\\AssemblyVersion\\CreateBuildLog.bat&quot; &quot;$(ProjectDir)&quot; @(VersionNumber) The BUILDAs we have now the BuildLogs, we can use them in the template: 123456789101112131415161718192021&lt;# ... //Get BuildLog of max version string buildlogFolder = this.Host.ResolvePath(&quot;BuildLogs&quot;); string buildLog = buildlogFolder + &quot;\\\\&quot; + maxVersion.major + &quot;.&quot; + maxVersion.minor + &quot;.log&quot;; //Get number of lines from BuildLog or create a new log (!) var buildCount = 1; if (File.Exists(buildLog)) &#123; buildCount = File.ReadLines(buildLog).Count() + 1; &#125; else &#123; File.Create(buildLog).Dispose(); &#125; //Set BUILD int build = buildCount;#&gt; Very important is to create the log file, if it doesn’t exists! Otherwise the build will always fail, because the version attributes can’t be created. The REVISIONAt least we have to set the REVISION number, by calculating the difference between the current date and the initialDate, which we have previously read from the AssemblyVersion.json: 1234567&lt;# ... //Set REVISION var dateCreated = DateTime.Parse(avObject.initialDate); int revision = (DateTime.Now.Date - dateCreated.Date).Days;#&gt; Transforming T4 template on buildThe last hurdle is to run the text transformation every time you build your product. Until now it runs only on saving the AssemblyVersion.tt. A great helper on that was Thomas Levesque’s post “Transform T4 templates as part of the build, and pass variables from the project”, where he describes every difficulty to reach this goal. To make it short: We have to edit the CSPROJ file again, to introduce TextTemplating to MSBuild. First we need following near the beginning of the projects XML: 1234567891011&lt;PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;VisualStudioVersion Condition=&quot;&#x27;$(VisualStudioVersion)&#x27; == &#x27;&#x27;&quot;&gt; 16.0 &lt;/VisualStudioVersion&gt; &lt;VSToolsPath Condition=&quot;&#x27;$(VSToolsPath)&#x27; == &#x27;&#x27;&quot;&gt; $(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v$(VisualStudioVersion) &lt;/VSToolsPath&gt; &lt;TransformOnBuild&gt;true&lt;/TransformOnBuild&gt; &lt;OverwriteReadOnlyOutputFiles&gt;true&lt;/OverwriteReadOnlyOutputFiles&gt; &lt;TransformOutOfDateOnly&gt;false&lt;/TransformOutOfDateOnly&gt;&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt; Secondly add the IMPORT of the TextTemplating target AFTER the CSharp target: 123&lt;Import Project=&quot;$(MSBuildToolsPath)\\Microsoft.CSharp.targets&quot; /&gt;...&lt;Import Project=&quot;$(VSToolsPath)\\TextTemplating\\Microsoft.TextTemplating.targets&quot; /&gt; If you build your product now, a new build log is created and the version numbers BUILD and REVISION are automatically increased. See it in actionThe project where I implemented this versioning first is HexoCommander. Feel free to download the code and see how the new versioning mechanism works.

Pooling ImagesAs it is time consuming to generate the necessary images, I have created another static folder pool to store prepared files and a text file with the additional information about the image. The structure of pool is different to photos, because of my image workflow and some limitations of automating the provisioning. 12345678| static/ | pool/ | my-lovely-picture/ | meta.txt | mobile.jpg | normal.jpg | tablet.jpg | ... The meta.txt is a simple text file with two lines of text: first the name of the image and second the Url to link to, which will be inserted in the appropriate Frontmatter fields on creating a new post: 12My Lovely Imagehttps://500px.com/photo/123456789/My-Lovely-Image Automate binding and provisioning on new postDevelopers are lazy and I do not make an exception. Having all these pool images and the meta informations, it would be nice, if Hexo just picks and processes one of the pool folders automatically, when I’m creating a new post by calling hexo new &quot;My shiny new post&quot; … and it was easier then I thought. Where to place the code for the automatismHexo has a great API to write plugins and it is not very difficult to setup a new plugin for this, which can be published to the NPM registry. But it is also possible to extend Hexo’s functionality by using a simple script. All you need is a script folder in the root of your Hexo project. Any JS files which is placed there, will be executed by Hexo. Therefore, lets use a script called \\scripts\\process-photo-on-new.js … Things an automatism should do - Step by Step Hook into the creation of a post Pick randomly one of the pool images Place the content of the meta.txt in the Frontmatter Move the 3 device-dependend images into the photos folder Step 1 - Hook into the creation of a postThe needed event, the automatism can hook on, is: 123hexo.on(&#x27;new&#x27;, function(data)&#123; //&#125;); It will be executed every time you call the hexo new command. The parameter data is an object with two fields: pathFull path to the MD file of the new post contentComplete content of the scaffold (template), which Hexo has used to create the new post; default is /scaffolds/post.md. By preloading the Hexo Front matter library and parsing data.content we get access to the definition of the new post: 1234567const front = require(&#x27;hexo-front-matter&#x27;);hexo.on(&#x27;new&#x27;, function(post)&#123; // parse article content var post = front.parse(data.content);&#125;); Step 2 - Pick randomly one of the pool imagesThere are some build-in variables to get the full path, for example, of the source folder, we can use to define the needed paths to the pool and the photo folder. 123456789const front = require(&#x27;hexo-front-matter&#x27;);hexo.on(&#x27;new&#x27;, function(post)&#123; var post = front.parse(data.content); // set the path variables var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;pool&quot;; var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;photos&quot;;&#125;); Next, we need to preload the Hexo FS library for file access, to list the content of the poolDir, including the subfolders, and filter out the meta files. Out of the resulting array we pick one randomly, to use for the new post: 123456789101112131415161718192021const front = require(&#x27;hexo-front-matter&#x27;);const fs = require(&#x27;hexo-fs&#x27;);hexo.on(&#x27;new&#x27;, function(post)&#123; var post = front.parse(data.content); var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;pool&quot;; var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;photos&quot;; // list all files var files = fs.listDirSync(poolDir); // filter the list to get meta files of each subfolder var metaFiles = files.filter(file =&gt; file.match(/.*[\\\\]meta.txt/g)); // pick one randomly var metaFile = metaFiles[Math.floor(Math.random() * metaFiles.length)]; // get the name of the picked photo (foldername) var photoName = metaFile.split(&quot;\\\\&quot;)[0];&#125;); Step 3 - Place the content of the meta.txt in the FrontmatterNow we have to read the meta file, place the data in the Frontmatter and save the article file: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930const front = require(&#x27;hexo-front-matter&#x27;);const fs = require(&#x27;hexo-fs&#x27;);hexo.on(&#x27;new&#x27;, function(post)&#123; var post = front.parse(data.content); var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;pool&quot;; var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;photos&quot;; var files = fs.listDirSync(poolDir); var metaFiles = files.filter(file =&gt; file.match(/.*[\\\\]meta.txt/g)); var metaFile = metaFiles[Math.floor(Math.random() * metaFiles.length)]; var photoName = metaFile.split(&quot;\\\\&quot;)[0]; // read meta file var meta = fs.readFileSync(poolDir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + metaFile); var metas = meta.split(&quot;\\n&quot;); // place file and additional info in the Frontmatter post.photograph.file = photoName + &quot;.jpg&quot;; post.photograph.name = metas[0]; post.photograph.link = metas[1]; // convert content back postStr = front.stringify(post); postStr = &#x27;---\\n&#x27; + postStr; // store article fs.writeFile(data.path, postStr, &#x27;utf-8&#x27;);&#125;); Step 4 - Move the 3 device-dependend images into the photos folderLast but not least, we have to move the pool images into the photos folder and remove the pool folder with all its processed content: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051const front = require(&#x27;hexo-front-matter&#x27;);const fs = require(&#x27;hexo-fs&#x27;);hexo.on(&#x27;new&#x27;, function(post)&#123; var post = front.parse(data.content); var poolDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;pool&quot;; var photosDir = hexo.source_dir.replace(&quot;\\source&quot;, hexo.config.static_dir) + &quot;photos&quot;; var files = fs.listDirSync(poolDir); var metaFiles = files.filter(file =&gt; file.match(/.*[\\\\]meta.txt/g)); var metaFile = metaFiles[Math.floor(Math.random() * metaFiles.length)]; var photoName = metaFile.split(&quot;\\\\&quot;)[0]; var meta = fs.readFileSync(poolDir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + metaFile); var metas = meta.split(&quot;\\n&quot;); post.photograph.file = photoName + &quot;.jpg&quot;; post.photograph.name = metas[0]; post.photograph.link = metas[1]; postStr = front.stringify(post); postStr = &#x27;---\\n&#x27; + postStr; fs.writeFile(data.path, postStr, &#x27;utf-8&#x27;); //copy normal image fs.copyFile( poolDir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + photoName + &quot;\\\\normal.jpg&quot;, photosDir + &quot;\\\\normal\\\\&quot; + photoName + &quot;.jpg&quot;, function() &#123; //copy tablet image fs.copyFile( poolDir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + photoName + &quot;\\\\tablet.jpg&quot;, photosDir + &quot;\\\\tablet\\\\&quot; + photoName + &quot;.jpg&quot;, function() &#123; //copy mobile image fs.copyFile( poolDir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + photoName + &quot;\\\\mobile.jpg&quot;, photosDir + &quot;\\\\mobile\\\\&quot; + photoName + &quot;.jpg&quot;, function() &#123; //remove processed pool folder fs.rmdirSync(poolDir + &quot;\\\\&quot; + photoName); &#125;); &#125;); &#125;);&#125;); Now it so easy to write a new post, because almost everything is set and I can concentrate on the article. Also, it is a nice surprise to see, which photo the script has chosen. The only thing I have to do from time to time, is to refill the pool folder with new images.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"Blogging","slug":"Blogging","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Blogging/"}]},{"title":"Localization with resource files in JavaScript web apps","subtitle":"How to work with Visual Studio resource files for localization in Single Page Applications","date":"2020-06-13","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/Localization-with-resource-files-in-JavaScript-web-apps/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Localization-with-resource-files-in-JavaScript-web-apps/","excerpt":"There are plenty of editors out there to help you writing JavaScript web applications.

As I’m working in my daily life with Visual Studio, it is a obvious choice for me. One of the most time saving tools in VS is the plugin ResXManager, which is an awesome assistant on managing the translations for a Desktop- or ASP.NET-App, which uses XML-based RESX files. Mostly very localization is based on key/value pairs, defined in separate files for every language provided. Implementing several languages in pure JavaScript apps is a little more difficult, because it makes no sense to deal with big XML files in JS. All localization libraries in the market uses JSON for storing the translations and it is a little bit of work to find the right one for your requirements. Localization in JavaScriptFor a current project I use jquery-lang, because it provides the switch of the apps UI language without reloading and it is easy to implement. Thanks Rob Evans for your work… The definition of “tokens” in one JSON file for each language is quite easy: ../languages/en.json12345&#123; &quot;token&quot;: &#123; &quot;my-test&quot;: &quot;My Test in English&quot; &#125;&#125; ../languages/de.json12345&#123; &quot;token&quot;: &#123; &quot;my-test&quot;: &quot;Mein Test in Deutsch&quot; &#125;&#125; The usage also: 1&lt;div lang=&quot;en&quot; data-lang-token=&quot;my-test&quot;&gt; Using RESX and convert to JSON on buildHaving this, the most time consuming work is to enter the translations to the localization files. If you have hundreds of them, it is hard to keep the 2, 3 or more language files in sync. You need a helper… And here comes ResXManager to the rescue, if you work with VS … but it needs a conversation from RESX to the JSON format jquery-lang uses and this a task, which can be done on building the JS app, by using a task runner like Grunt. As there was no Grunt plugin/task out there to fit my needs, I have created grunt-resource2json (GitHub, NPM). The configuration in the gruntfile.js is like: gruntfile.js12345678910111213141516171819202122grunt.initConfig(&#123; resource2json: &#123; convert: &#123; options: &#123; format: &quot;jquery-lang&quot; &#125;, files: [ &#123; input: &quot;resources/Resource.resx&quot;, output: &quot;build/langpacks/en.json&quot; &#125;, &#123; input: &quot;resources/Resource.de-DE.resx&quot;, output: &quot;build/langpacks/de.json&quot; &#125;, &#123; input: &quot;resources/Resource.es-ES.resx&quot;, output: &quot;build/langpacks/es.json&quot; &#125; ] &#125; &#125;); It takes one RESX file (input) and converts it to a JSON file (output) in an array of files. The heavy work in the plugin is done by the library xml2js, which transforms the complete XML of the RESX file into a JSON object in one call. All I had to do, was to write all DATA nodes in a loop into the jquery-lang given structure and save it as JSON. Currently supported is the format for jquery-lang only, but it would be awesome, if you fork the code on GitHub and send me a Pull Request with the implementation of your needed format.","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/"}],"tags":[{"name":"GitHub","slug":"GitHub","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/GitHub/"},{"name":"Visual Studio","slug":"Visual-Studio","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Visual-Studio/"},{"name":"Resource","slug":"Resource","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Resource/"},{"name":"Localization","slug":"Localization","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Localization/"}]},{"title":"TFS/DevOps: Delete Remote Workspace","subtitle":null,"date":"2020-02-28","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/TFS-DevOps-Delete-Remote-Workspace/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/TFS-DevOps-Delete-Remote-Workspace/","excerpt":"If you are working with freelance developers and Azure DevOps/TFS with TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control) in your company, maybe this will look familiar to you: You hire a new freelancer and you want to reuse the hardware, including the complete software setup, to bring him/her to work as fast and straightforward as possible.

You set up a new Azure Devops account with all necessary permissions and you think you’re done. No you are not… Everytime a user connects to a Team Project on Azure DevOps via Visual Studio and gets the code, VS is creating a remote workspace on the server, with the machine name as default, therefor it is not enough to wipe the profile and any other legacies of the last user from the machine. You also have to remove the remote workspace. Otherwise you will get an error message like that, if you are using a unique file structure on the developers hard disc: 1The working folder c://xxx is already in use by the workspace yyy;zzz on computer yyy The variable xxx stands for the blocked folder, yyy for the workspace/machine name and zzz for the users id on Azure DevOps. Unfortunately, there is no visual management console on Azure DevOps to manage your server workspaces, but there is a command line tool called tf.exe. The easiest way to get rid of the unused server workspace in 3 steps: Step 1Run Developer Command Prompt with Administrator privileges from Visual Studio 2019 and login with your Azure DevOps credentials. If the Login dialog doesn’t show up, force it by executing: 1tf.exe workspace Step 2Get a list of all remote workspaces available in your DevOps Collection by running the command: 1tf.exe workspaces /computer:* /owner:* /format:xml &gt; c:\\temp\\workspaces.xml You can get a list of all your workspaces by running tf workspaces, but the list only shows you the owner, but not the necessary ownerid and … it is nicer to have a file to search in. Step 3Find the abandoned workspace in the list and note its name and ownerid for running the command: 1tf workspace /delete &#123;WORKSPACE.name&#125;;&#123;WORKSPACE.ownerid&#125; Now your new colleague can create his own workspace on the same machine. UpdateIn case you want to switch your own DevOps account to another and use the same folder as before, you can certainly delete the local workspace, but this wont help, because you are still logged in at TeamExplorer and the folder knows to whom it belongs. Solution is easy: Quit Visual Studio Rename folder in ***_OLD or something Create new folder with the same name Enter C:\\Users\\YOUR-NAME\\appdata\\Local\\Microsoft\\Team Foundation\\VS-VERSION\\Cache and emtpy the folder to let Visual Studio forget who you are Remove all your Remote Workspaces as described above Start Visual Studio, connect in TeamExplorer to your TFS server and map the code to your folder More Info Microsoft Docs: Use Team Foundation version control commandsStackoverflow: How to remove TFS workspace mapping for another user","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Visual Studio","slug":"Visual-Studio","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Visual-Studio/"},{"name":"TFS/DevOps","slug":"TFS-DevOps","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/TFS-DevOps/"}]},{"title":"Better Input Change Event","subtitle":null,"date":"2019-11-26","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/Better-Input-Change-Event/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Better-Input-Change-Event/","excerpt":"Often it is important to trigger an event, after the user of your website/web app has filled out an text input.

Best solution is, to observe the users key strokes and trigger the event, when he stops typing. Then there is no extra action needed by the user and the event isn’t triggered multiple times. Here’s an implementation with jQuery: 12345678910$(&quot;#my-text-input&quot;).keyup(function () &#123; var $this = $(this); clearTimeout($.data(this, &#x27;timer&#x27;)); var wait = setTimeout(function () &#123; //do something with the value... &#125;, 1000); $(this).data(&#x27;timer&#x27;, wait);&#125;); Important is to wipe and set the timer on every key up, to achive that the event will be executed after 1 second after the last key stroke only.","categories":[{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/JavaScript/"}],"tags":[{"name":"jQuery","slug":"jQuery","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/jQuery/"}]},{"title":"Hexo and the Dark Mode ... revised","subtitle":"Second approach to implement 'prefers-color-scheme'","series":"A New Blog","date":"2019-10-26","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode-revised/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode-revised/","excerpt":"While writing my post Hexo and the Dark Mode a few days ago, I thought it would be nice, if I could switch between the normal (light) and the dark theme, I’ve created for the support of the OS-related Dark Mode, even manually.

I wrapped all necessary code into a seperate JS file and placed a reference in the after-footer.ejs, which places it at the bottom of the HTML: 1&lt;%- js(&#39;js&#x2F;dark-mode-toggle.js&#39;) %&gt; 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758function detectColorScheme() &#123; var theme = &quot;light&quot;; //default // get last used theme from local cache if(localStorage.getItem(&quot;theme&quot;))&#123; if(localStorage.getItem(&quot;theme&quot;) === &quot;dark&quot;)&#123; theme = &quot;dark&quot;; &#125; &#125; else if(!window.matchMedia) &#123; // matchMedia not supported return false; &#125; else if(window.matchMedia(&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot;).matches) &#123; // OS has set Dark Mode theme = &quot;dark&quot;; &#125; // set detected theme if (theme === &quot;dark&quot;) &#123; setThemeDark(); &#125; else &#123; setThemeLight(); &#125;&#125;const toggleTheme = document.querySelector(&#x27;input#theme-switch[type=&quot;checkbox&quot;]&#x27;);function setThemeDark() &#123; localStorage.setItem(&#x27;theme&#x27;, &#x27;dark&#x27;); document.documentElement.setAttribute(&#x27;data-theme&#x27;, &#x27;dark&#x27;); toggleTheme.checked = true;&#125;function setThemeLight() &#123; localStorage.setItem(&#x27;theme&#x27;, &#x27;light&#x27;); document.documentElement.setAttribute(&#x27;data-theme&#x27;, &#x27;light&#x27;); toggleTheme.checked = false;&#125;// Listener for theme change by toggletoggleTheme.addEventListener(&#x27;change&#x27;, function(e) &#123; if (e.target.checked) &#123; setThemeDark(); &#125; else &#123; setThemeLight(); &#125;&#125;, false);// Listener for theme change by OSvar toggleOS = window.matchMedia(&#x27;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&#x27;);toggleOS.addEventListener(&#x27;change&#x27;, function (e) &#123; if (e.matches) &#123; setThemeDark(); &#125; else &#123; setThemeLight(); &#125;&#125;);// call theme detectiondetectColorScheme(); By using the both addEventListener‘s, each switch will be recognized and this approach is capable to support even more themes, just by using different values in the data-theme attribute.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"CSS","slug":"CSS","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/CSS/"},{"name":"Stylus","slug":"Stylus","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Stylus/"},{"name":"Dark Mode","slug":"Dark-Mode","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Dark-Mode/"}]},{"title":"Hexo and the Dark Mode","subtitle":"First approach to implement 'prefers-color-scheme'","series":"A New Blog","date":"2019-10-23","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/Hexo-and-the-Dark-Mode/","excerpt":"Due to the fact, that nowadays everybody is talking about Dark Modes for Browsers and Operating Systems, in order to save battery or for easier reading (uhh, really?), I decided my blog should support that.","keywords":"due fact nowadays talking dark modes browsers operating systems order save battery easier reading uhh decided blog support","text":"Due to the fact, that nowadays everybody is talking about Dark Modes for Browsers and Operating Systems, in order to save battery or for easier reading (uhh, really?), I decided my blog should support that. Starting point is the new media query prefers-color-scheme, which is actually supported by all modern browsers. TechniqueMy first read was Tom Brow’s Dark mode in a website with CSS, where he shows how to use the media query. Simplified, this is it, assuming the light version is the default: 1234567891011body &#123; background-color: white; color: black;&#125;@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) &#123; body &#123; background-color: black; color: white; &#125;&#125; Pimping CSS for automatic switchingTo support the automatic browser/OS-based automatic switch in Hexo, where Stylus is used, I had to change some template files. First the _variables.styl: 1234567891011121314// existing color variablescolor-background = #f1f1f1color-foreground = #111color-border = #ddd...// new dark color variablesdark-color-background = #111dark-color-foreground = #eeedark-color-border = #000...// new media query variableprefers-dark = &quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; Next step was to change the _extend.styl, where some Stylus variables are defining complete blocks to extend. Here I had to supplement all lines, where something mode-dependend was defined, by adding the new prefers-dark media query and beneath the new ‘dark’ equivalence of the style: 12345678910111213141516171819$base-style hr ... border: 1px dashed color-border-article @media prefers-dark border: 1px dashed dark-color-border-article ...$block ... background: color-block box-shadow: 1px 2px 3px color-border border: 1px solid color-border @media prefers-dark background: dark-color-block box-shadow: 1px 2px 3px dark-color-border border-color: dark-color-border... The same changes I had to do in every template styl file, where one of the colors or other mode dependent style was used. For example: 12345678#mobile-nav-header background-color: color-background @media prefers-dark background-color: dark-color-background img.avatar ... @media prefers-dark filter: brightness(85%) This will be rendered as: 123456789101112131415#mobile-nav-header &#123; background-color: #f1f1f1;&#125;@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) &#123; #mobile-nav-header &#123; background-color: #111; &#125;&#125;#mobile-nav-header img.avatar &#123; ...&#125;@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) &#123; filter: brightness(85%);&#125; Please note the use of filter:brightness() in the example. It is always advisable to darken the images too, because they can really pop out on dark backgrounds.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"CSS","slug":"CSS","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/CSS/"},{"name":"Stylus","slug":"Stylus","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Stylus/"},{"name":"Dark Mode","slug":"Dark-Mode","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Dark-Mode/"}]},{"title":"A New Blog: Blogging and Synching en route","subtitle":"Part Three of having fun with Hexo and GitHub Pages","series":"A New Blog","date":"2019-10-01","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-route/","excerpt":"I work with several devices, some Windows, some Android, and sometimes I have time to write on my articles at home (Notebook, Tablet), in my spare time in the office (Desktop, Laptop) or on my way to somewhere (Smartphone).

Right now I’m am in a barber shop, waiting for my haircut and write these lines. So, wherever I am, I need the Hexo project locally, but in sync on a digital device. The blog is synced via Dropbox, but hosted on GitHub Pages, so on every device I need the publishing functions of Git too. Sync Hexo ProjectBest option for me to achieve this was Dropbox. Another benefit on that is: I can work on the structure of the blog wherever I am and commit when the new feature or improvement is done, because all Git related files are always in sync too. Writing, Editing and Publishing on WindowsMy preferred editor is Visual Studio Code. Good file handling, easy writing, full Git integration and tons of other plugins and helpers. Chapeau Microsoft, well done. Some of the following VS Code plugins makes working with Hexo on GitHub pages a breeze: Adds Hexo commands like init, new, generate, server and clean to the VS Code command palette. Keyboard shortcuts for basic formatting, automatic list editing, autocomlete for images, table formatter and much more for an easier handling of Markdown. Markdown linting and style checking Adds syntax highlighting and code completion to Stylus files Complete visual management of your repositories in VS Code View a Git Graph of your repository with all changes and manage commits. With this editor and its helpers, I’m just two clicks away from publishing a new article or even a new version of the Hexo blog itself. Writing on AndroidThere are a lot of Markdown editors available on Google Play, but one is outstanding: iA Writer for Android. I can open my posts or drafts directly from Dropbox, without the need of any sychronization. Open, write, close, done. Publishing on AndroidThere are some Git related Android apps out there, but no solution was satisfying. Furthermore, I didn’t really need Git here, because I didn’t want to have all source files on my smartphone. I’m working directly on the Dropbox stored MD files via iA Writer. Finally and most important, Git won’t be enough, because before publishing, I have to run hexo generate! Therefore some sort of automatic transfer from Dropbox to GitHub is also out of the game. What I needed, was to tell a server at a certain point of time ‘Hey, please publish for me’, using the only connection I have: Dropbox. Introducing a DemonI have a little media server, running on Windows, and he is synchronizing some folders with Dropbox. He could do the job! After I installed all necessary packages, like NodeJS, Hexo and Git, I included the project folder into the sync. Next step was to design a so called Hexo Command File, a simple TXT file, which holds commands in single lines, extended with execution times, when they were successfully running. 12345postdraft: A-New-Blog-Blogging-and-Synching-en-routepublishnewdraft: &quot;A New Blog: Blogging and Synching en route&quot; @ 2019-09-30 21:15regenerate @ 2019-09-29 16:40:01publish @ 2019-09-29 16:40:10 These commands are predefined, because they bundle several real commands and I didn’t want to deal with real commands, due to security reasons. The unprocessed commands are standing at the top of the file (in execution order!) and parameters are separated from the command by a colon and delimited by commas. &lt;command&gt;: [&lt;param1&gt;, ...] @ &lt;execution time&gt; Next step was to create a program to work as an executing demon, who monitors the Hexo Command File (synced by Dropbox) on my server and executes commands without execution dates. I decided to create a simple Console Application in C# and use the built-in Windows Task Scheduler for running it every 2 minutes. The application is called HexoCommander and is available at GitHub. It expects the Hexo Command File to be named hexo-commands.txt, located in the same folder, and provides the following commands: newdraft: “&lt;title&gt;” … runs hexo new draft &quot;&lt;title&gt;&quot; Creates a new draft. postdraft: “&lt;filename without extension&gt;” … runs hexo publish &quot;&lt;filename without extension&gt;&quot; Makes a post out of a draft. regenerate … runs hexo clean hexo generate Wipes all Hexo static pages and generates them new. publish … runs hexo generate git add &quot;source/*&quot; &quot;docs/*&quot; git commit -m &quot;Remote publication via HexoCommander&quot; git push origin master Generates Hexo static pages, stage changes on drafts, posts and static pages, commits the changes with a generic message and pushes them to the server. Running the demonI would have never expected, that the trickiest part was to get HexoCommander running via Windows Task Scheduler. What a mess! I finally find the solution here: Compile HexoCommander in a x86 configuration Create a new task in Task Scheduler with Trigger Dialy Recur every 1 days Repeat task every 2 minutes for a duration of 1 day Action Program/Script: %systemroot%\\Syswow64\\cmd.exe Add Arguments: /C “C:\\MyPath\\HexoCommander.exe /workdir=C:\\MyPath” Start In: **%systemroot%\\Syswow64\\** Because some executing commands in the chain are NOT 64-bit, I had to force Task Scheduler to run the 32-bit Command Shell in its own path (see ‘Start In’ and don’t forget the closing backslash) and take the 32-bit compiled HexoCommander as argument after the parameter /C (forcing command to terminate), including its own argument for defining the real working directory.

I will show you which of these I found worth to work with… Relative Image PathThe build-in way to include images in your posts works fine, but it is a little aside the normal way to declare images in Markdown. The plugin [Hexo Asset Link] corrects that. After installing via npm install hexo-asset-link --save you can write this: ![Test Image](hello-world/image-1.png) The best is, that VS Code’s Markdown can now show the image. UPDATE:Actually the plugin destroys external links, so don’t use it until this is fixed … or go to node_modules &gt; hexo-asset-link &gt; index.js in your project and change in line 22 protocal to protocol. UPDATE from Update:liolok, the author of the plugin has merged my pull request and published a new new version without the typo. It works now as expected. Hide PostsA new Hexo project comes with a sample post called Hello World. This is fine to play around with, but you don’t want to publish it. Here comes a Hexo plugin to the rescue called Hexo Hide Posts. After installing, you just have to write hidden: true to the Front Matter of you post and it won’t be shown on the blog, but it is still available by URL. Static FilesHexo has the concept of Assets Folders, but for static files, beside article based files, I find it more useful to have a STATIC folder and copy the contents on every build into the publish folder. A good helper for this approach is the plugin Hexo Generator Copy. Install it by running npm install hexo-generator-copy --save and add static_dir: static to your _config.yml and you are done. ![Hexo Static Files](/post/A-New-Blog-Customizing-Hexo/vscode-1.png) FeedThe default Hexo layout has an Atom Feed icon in the upper right corner, but strangely no feed file is generated on build. You need to install the plugin Hexo Feed Generator to fix this, by running npm install hexo-generator-feed --save and copy following section into the _config.yml: 123456789feed: type: atom path: atom.xml limit: 20 hub: content: content_limit: 140 content_limit_delim: &#x27; &#x27; order_by: -date Manifest for PWAIn these modern times it’s always a good idea, that your blog feels like an App. For this you need a manifest file (JSON) an several icons (PNG). You can generate these files very fast with the Web App Manifest Generator and store it in your static folder. To bind this file into your blog, you can use the plugin Hexo PWA. Run npm install --save hexo-pwa and copy following section to your _config.yml, where you take the settings from your generated manifest file: 1234567891011121314151617pwa: manifest: path: /manifest.json body: name: myblog.de short_name: My Blog icons: - src: /images/icon-192x192.png sizes: 192x192 type: image/png - src: /images/icon-512x512.png sizes: 512x512 type: image/png start_url: /index.html theme_color: &#x27;#025ab1&#x27; background_color: &#x27;#dddddd&#x27; display: standalone Sitemap FileTo help Google and others a bit to index your blog, it is advisable to provide a sitemap file. Here comes Hexo Generator Sitemap to the rescue. Install it by running the command npm install hexo-generator-sitemap --save. You can configure it via _config.yml: 123sitemap: path: sitemap.xml template: ./sitemap-template.xml The plugin installation doesn’t create the needed sitemap-template file, so be sure you grab a copy from the plugins repository: https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap/blob/master/sitemap.xml CommentingHexo doesn’t have a commenting system, but it’s prepared to stick Disqus comments under each article. Just create a new Disqus account for your blog and note the given short name. By adding following section to the _config.yml Hexo shows the commenting section: 12disqus_enabled: truedisqus_shortname: my-blog Inifinite ScrollHexo shows as much articles at the start page as configured in _config.yml under index_generator.per_page, but it’s nicer to load more articles as you scroll by using the Hexo script Inifinite Scroll. Install by adding following little script in themes &amp; gt; layout &gt; _partial &gt; after-footer.ejs 12345678&lt;script src=&quot;//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/frontendsophie/hexo-infinite-scroll@2.0.0/dist/main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; infiniteScroll(&#123; showNum: 5, style: &#x27;line-scale&#x27;, color: &#x27;#025ab1&#x27; &#125;)&lt;/script&gt; Back To TopIts nice to support the reader on scolling by providing a Scroll-To-Top button. The easiest way to get this, is the script Vanilla Back To Top. Just add follwing to themes &gt;layout &gt; _partial &gt; after-footer.ejs: 123456789101112131415&lt;script&gt;addBackToTop(&#123; diameter: 30, backgroundColor: &#x27;rgb(0, 90, 180)&#x27;, textColor: &#x27;#fff&#x27;&#125;)&lt;/script&gt;&lt;style&gt;#back-to-top &#123; border-radius: 0; opacity: 0.6;&#125;#back-to-top:hover &#123; opacity: 1;&#125;&lt;/style&gt;","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"VS Code","slug":"VS-Code","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/VS-Code/"},{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"Blogging","slug":"Blogging","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Blogging/"}]},{"title":"A New Blog: VS Code, Hexo and GitHub Pages","subtitle":"Part One of having fun with Hexo and GitHub Pages","series":"A New Blog","date":"2019-09-24","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/A-New-Blog-VS-Code-Hexo-and-GitHub-Pages/","excerpt":"A few days ago I puzzled over a technical problem regarding SQL Server, Active Directory and Visual Studio Database Projects.

Installation.. is quite easy, as described here: https://hexo.io/docs/setup Create folder and open in VS Code Open VS Code Terminal window Install Hexo with $ npm install -g hexo-cli Init Hexo project with $ hexo init Install dependencies with npm install Done WritingCreate new post/draftHexo has posts and drafts, whereat drafts has to published via a Hexo command to become a post. To create an article use the command hexo new post|draft &quot;My Title&quot;. The title will be converted in a URL-encoded string and will be used as file name and url. Meta dataEvery post/draft starts with its header (so called Front Matter) to store some meta data, which describes the post, like title, date, tags or categories. This is used by Hexo to classify and arrange your post during the build. MarkdownHexo posts/drafts are written in Markdown. Good syntax reference are the Markdown Guide and the more detailed Markdown Syntax Guide. ExcerptIs is usual to show a short excerpt an the start page of a blog, to keep it compact and teasering the user to click on a READ MORE button. To achieve this, you just have to add following comment to your article. Everything above is the excerpt and everything below is only shown, when you enter the article: &lt;!-- more --&gt; ImagesSome articles will contain images to illustrate something and the question is, where should they be stored? Answer: In a folder beside the post/draft, which has the same name as the article MD file. To get this, you have to activate the setting post_asset_folder in your _config.yml. Now this folder will be created automatically, when you add a new post/draft. In your Markdown you reference your image with: &#123;% asset_img image-1.png \"Test Image\" %&#125; BuildHexo is a website generator, so a build will generate the whole website in a special folder, which has to be published. This output folder can be configured in the _config.yml: public_dir: public To wipe the output folder, run the command: hexo clean To start the build, run: hexo generate To view the website via the build-in local Hexo server, run: hexo server PublishingMost “complex” task was to publish the new blog on GitHub Pages. My first approach was to use my personal page, as I did with my single HTML file, but this didn’t work, because I wanted to store the whole project on GitHub and it is not possible to point a personal page to the subdirectory docs or use a different branch as master. The simple solution was to create a new repository, named after my my blog kiko.io, to store teh whole project and point the GitHub Page to the subdirectory docs in the settings of the repository. By overriding the default publish folder of Hexo in _config.yml … public_dir: docs … everything was set up. Commit and Push via git and done. Hexo has its own deploying mechanism and it is advisable to disable it, by commenting out the Deployment section _config.yml. Next step was to use my own custom domain for the blog. To achieve this, the most easiest way is to create a text file named CNAME (without extension!) with the content of the domain in a single line and publish this file in the root of the docs folder. Github will recognize this file and do the setup automatically. To point the domain to GitHub, I had to create following A records in my domain providers DNS settings: 185.199.108.153 185.199.109.153 185.199.110.153 185.199.111.153 Last step was to enable Enforce HTTPS in the repositories settings.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://kiko.io/categories/Tools/"}],"tags":[{"name":"VS Code","slug":"VS-Code","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/VS-Code/"},{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"GitHub","slug":"GitHub","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/GitHub/"},{"name":"Blogging","slug":"Blogging","permalink":"https://kiko.io/tags/Blogging/"}]},{"title":"How-To: Visual Studio Database Project and ADSI","subtitle":null,"date":"2019-09-17","updated":"2021-05-17","path":"post/How-To-Visual-Studio-Database-Project-and-ADSI/","permalink":"https://kiko.io/post/How-To-Visual-Studio-Database-Project-and-ADSI/","excerpt":"If you are working with a Visual Studio Database Project and have to deal with data from the Active Directory via a Linked Server, you have to announce the data structure of the AD data in order to get the project compiled.","keywords":"working visual studio database project deal data active directory linked server announce structure ad order compiled","text":"If you are working with a Visual Studio Database Project and have to deal with data from the Active Directory via a Linked Server, you have to announce the data structure of the AD data in order to get the project compiled. Step 1 - Linking to the Active DirectoryFirst of all you have to connect your SQL Server to the AD permanently, by running following SQL script once on your SQL Server: USE [master] GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedserver @server = N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @srvproduct=N&#39;Active Directory Service Interfaces&#39;, @provider=N&#39;ADSDSOObject&#39;, @datasrc=N&#39;adsdatasource&#39; EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedsrvlogin @rmtsrvname=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @useself=N&#39;False&#39;, @locallogin=NULL, @rmtuser=N&#39;mydomain\\myadminuser&#39;, @rmtpassword=&#39;mypassword&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;collation compatible&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;data access&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;true&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;dist&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;pub&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;rpc&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;rpc out&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;sub&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;connect timeout&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;0&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;collation name&#39;, @optvalue=null GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;lazy schema validation&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;false&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;query timeout&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;0&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;use remote collation&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;true&#39; GO EXEC master.dbo.sp_serveroption @server=N&#39;ADSI&#39;, @optname=N&#39;remote proc transaction promotion&#39;, @optvalue=N&#39;true&#39; GO Step 2 - Fetching ADSI dataTo get data, use OpenQuery against the Linked Server. In order to get only persons and no system accounts, you should filter out all users, which has no firstname (givenName) or lastname (sn): SELECT UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName], sn AS [LastName], givenName AS [FirstName], title AS [Title], Mail as [MailAddress], department AS [Department], l AS [Location], postalCode AS [PostCode], streetAddress AS [Street], st AS [State] FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, &#39; SELECT UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, sAMAccountName, sn, givenName, department, title, Mail, l, postalCode, streetAddress, st FROM &#39;&#39;LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de&#39;&#39; WHERE objectClass = &#39;&#39;User&#39;&#39; AND objectCategory = &#39;&#39;Person&#39;&#39; AND sn=&#39;&#39;*&#39;&#39; AND givenName = &#39;&#39;*&#39;&#39; &#39;) In most cases you’re done with that … except your organisation has more the 900 users! Then you have to split the fetch in several requests, because SQL Server quits with an error, when trying to read more than 900 records via ADSI. Best option is, to filter the ADSI statement by something like ‘get all user starting with a to j’, when you are sure, that in this case less than 900 records will be given back and repeat the statement several times and glue the data together via a UNION statement: SELECT UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName], sn AS [LastName], givenName AS [FirstName], title AS [Title], Mail as [MailAddress], department AS [Department], l AS [Location], postalCode AS [PostCode], streetAddress AS [Street], st AS [State] FROM ( SELECT * FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, ' SELECT UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, sAMAccountName, sn, givenName, department, title, Mail, l, postalCode, streetAddress, st FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' WHERE objectClass = ''User'' AND objectCategory = ''Person'' AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*'' AND sAMAccountName &lt;= ''j'' ') UNION ALL SELECT * FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, ' SELECT [...same as above] FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' WHERE objectClass = ''User'' AND objectCategory = ''Person'' AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*'' AND sAMAccountName &gt; ''j'' AND sAMAccountName &lt; ''p'' ') UNION ALL SELECT * FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, ' SELECT [...same as above] FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' WHERE objectClass = ''User'' AND objectCategory = ''Person'' AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*'' AND sAMAccountName &gt;= ''p'' ') ) AD When you store this as a VIEW, you can join it wherever you want on SQL Server: CREATE VIEW [dbo].[vADUsers] AS [...SQL code from above] GO Step 3 - SQL Server Database ProjectIf you work with a SQL Server Database Project, to have the complete structure of your database available in a version control system, you will get some reference errors on compiling and publishing your newly added SQL View vADUsers and on some objects, which rely on this View, because of following problems: Project doesn’t know the Linked Server ADSI The structure (fields) of the data source is unknown Declare the Linked ServerTo show the Project that there is a Linked Server called ADSI, just add following lines at the start of your view: sp_addlinkedserver 'ADSI' GO CREATE VIEW [dbo].[vADUsers] AS [...SQL code from above] This mimics the adding of a Linked Server, but will be ignored by SQL Server on publish, because you already have a Linked Server with this name. The project is happy with it. Declare the data structureWhen you use the SQL-View vADUsers in a Stored Procedure for example, this object won’t compile, because the project knows nothing about the fields of the ADSI data source. The SELECT in the view is not enough. You have to add an empty SELECT to the View vADUsers, just for the declaration of the fields and without returning any records and join this via UNION with the other statements: sp_addlinkedserver 'ADSI' GO CREATE VIEW [dbo].[vtADAllUsers] AS SELECT UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, sAMAccountName AS [SamAccountName], sn AS [LastName], givenName AS [FirstName], title AS [Title], Mail as [MailAddress], department AS [Department], l AS [Location], postalCode AS [PostCode], streetAddress AS [Street], st AS [State] FROM ( -- Fake SELECT to declare the structure of the view SELECT TOP 0 '' UserPrincipalName, '' DisplayName, '' sAMAccountName, '' sn, '' givenName, '' department, '' title, '' Mail, '' l, '' postalCode, '' streetAddress, '' st UNION ALL SELECT * FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, ' SELECT UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, sAMAccountName, sn, givenName, department, title, Mail, l, postalCode, streetAddress, st FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' WHERE objectClass = ''User'' AND objectCategory = ''Person'' AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*'' AND sAMAccountName &gt;= ''j'' ') UNION ALL SELECT * FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, ' SELECT [...same as above] FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' WHERE objectClass = ''User'' AND objectCategory = ''Person'' AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*'' AND sAMAccountName &lt; ''j'' AND sAMAccountName &gt; ''p'' ') UNION ALL SELECT * FROM OpenQuery(ADSI, ' SELECT [...same as above] FROM ''LDAP://mydomain.de/DC=mydomain,DC=de'' WHERE objectClass = ''User'' AND objectCategory = ''Person'' AND sn=''*'' AND givenName = ''*'' AND sAMAccountName &lt;= ''p'' ') ) AD Now, you can fetch data from Active Directory and store the code in a Database Project properly.
