August in Germany is usually a safe bet when it comes to the weather, so my wife and I decided to relax for a few days on the [Mecklenburg Lake Plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecklenburg_Lake_Plateau) ... on a chartered boat. In general, you need a driving license for everything that moves in this country, but there are a few exceptions, such as in Brandenburg/Mecklenburg where even inexperienced tourists are allowed to steer a 12-metre houseboat/yacht across the many lakes after a short briefing.

The weather was, let's say, suboptimal this August, because a storm passed over us in the first three days and there was no chance of happy sailing around on the water. On the one hand, the swell and wind forces were extremely worrying for newbies and on the other, it's simply no fun being on a boat in cold, heavy rain. We were stuck in Rheinsberg.

Not only because it felt like luxury camping without people but only water around, but also because it gave a pleasant feeling of freedom. Yes, we weren't nearly alone on the lakes and getting a good spot in a marina for electricity and fresh water wasn't always easy, but then just anchoring in any lake for the night and being woken up by birdsong and a gentle swell was magical.

Below are a few pictures from this trip, some of which will be used again as hero images in this blog:
