    Starting a new project is always exciting, especially when the building platform is 
    totally new for oneself. As I started this blog with <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>, 
    I  had a good experience with JavaScript and some with Node, but no with EJS, Lodash and 
    some of the other libraries Hexo is using.

    This series is a little technical diary, how I started the blog and implemented my needs 
    one by one. Learning by doing. Maybe some of my solutions are valuable to somebody else, 
    who faces the same issues I had.

    Surfing around in the web is a daily routine every developer should have. Learning about 
    new platforms, libraries or techniques is a must, due to the tremendous speed on our business. 
    Stay current, all the time.

    I'm a fan of RSS and I'm using <a href="https://feedly.com">Feedly</a> to read my favourite 
    blogs. Unfortunately RSS feeds is not so common anymore, due to Facebook and other social media 
    giants, but I stay informed.

    In this series I present some of the absolute pearls I found while reading. Stunning solutions 
    or incredible tools, which I must first and foremost remember for myself, to try them out one day.
